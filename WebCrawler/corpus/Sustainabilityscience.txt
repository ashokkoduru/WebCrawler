<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p><b>Sustainability science</b> has emerged in the 21st century as a new academic discipline. This new field of science was officially introduced with a "Birth Statement" at the World Congress "Challenges of a Changing Earth 2001" in Amsterdam organized by the <a href="/wiki/International_Council_for_Science" title="International Council for Science">International Council for Science</a> (ICSU), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IGBP" title="IGBP">IGBP</a>), the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change and the <a href="/wiki/World_Climate_Research_Programme" title="World Climate Research Programme">World Climate Research Programme</a> (WCRP).</p>
<p>The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of “sustainability” a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>... brings together scholarship and practice, global and local perspectives from north and south, and disciplines across the natural and social sciences, engineering, and medicine</i> — it can be usefully thought of as <i>"neither ‘‘basic’’ nor ‘‘applied’’ research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs; it serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and land and water degradation.</p>
<p>Sustainability science, like <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a> itself, derives some impetus from the concepts of <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environmental science</a>. Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability while <a href="/wiki/Sustainability_measurement" title="Sustainability measurement">sustainability measurement</a> provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainability_governance" title="Sustainability governance">sustainability governance</a>.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>
<p>Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of "sustainability" or "sustainable development". As outlined by the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard University's Center for International Development sustainability science seeks to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Advance basic understanding of the dynamics of human-environment systems; to facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of practical interventions that promote sustainability in particular places and contexts; and to improve linkages between relevant research and innovation communities on the one hand, and relevant policy and management communities on the other</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more broad-based definition is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<i>The cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences (such as geology, ecology, climatology, oceanography) coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences, regionally and worldwide, of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future – that is, in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards</i>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been noted that the new paradigm</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"must encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults)."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others take a much broader view of sustainability science, emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system, such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancying society's well-being. In a 2012 article entitled "Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption," published in Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society, the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices, as well as in solving the problems they create, the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being, and others.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Broad_objectives">Broad objectives</span></h2>
<p>The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s, promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report <i><a href="/wiki/Our_Common_Future" title="Our Common Future">Our Common Future</a></i> in 1987, and noted in the <i><a href="/wiki/Agenda_21" title="Agenda 21">Agenda 21</a></i> plan that emerged from the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Environment_and_Development" title="United Nations Conference on Environment and Development">United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</a></i> in 1992 and further developed at the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Summit_on_Sustainable_Development" title="World Summit on Sustainable Development">World Summit on Sustainable Development</a></i>, held in Johannesburg in 2002.</p>
<p>The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science. Only in 2010 have the seminal papers and thinking of sustainability scientists been drawn together. In 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by Robert Kates, with introduction by William Clark, as : Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology - an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science. The 2012 Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication. This is work in progress. The 2012 Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Knowledge_structuring_of_issues">Knowledge structuring of issues</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected. This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia, industry and government.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coordination_of_data">Coordination of data</span></h3>
<p>The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines, topics and organisations. A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an “overview” of what is known. Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interdisciplinary_approaches">Interdisciplinary approaches</span></h3>
<p>The attempt, by sustainability science, to understand the integrated “whole” of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government. In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination.</p>
