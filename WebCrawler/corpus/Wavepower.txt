<p><b>Wave power</b> is the transport of energy by <a href="/wiki/Wind_wave" title="Wind wave">wind waves</a>, and the capture of that energy to do useful <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mechanical_work" title="Mechanical work">work</a> – for example, <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_desalination" title="Water desalination">water desalination</a>, or the <a href="/wiki/Pump" title="Pump">pumping</a> of water (into reservoirs). A machine able to exploit wave power is generally known as a <b>wave energy converter</b> (WEC).</p>
<p>Wave power is distinct from the diurnal flux of <a href="/wiki/Tidal_power" title="Tidal power">tidal power</a> and the steady gyre of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ocean_currents" title="Ocean currents">ocean currents</a>.

<p>Waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves, there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves. Both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave <a href="/wiki/Crest_(physics)" title="Crest (physics)">crest</a>, as well as friction on the water surface by the wind, making the water to go into the <a href="/wiki/Shear_stress" title="Shear stress">shear stress</a> causes the growth of the waves.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wave_height" title="Wave height">Wave height</a> is determined by wind speed, the duration of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the depth and topography of the seafloor (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves. When this limit has been reached the sea is said to be "fully developed".</p>
<p>In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed, <a href="/wiki/Wavelength" title="Wavelength">wavelength</a>, and water <a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ocean_surface_wave#Science_of_waves" title="Ocean surface wave">Oscillatory motion</a> is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Standing_waves" title="Standing waves">standing waves</a> (<a href="/wiki/Clapotis" title="Clapotis">clapotis</a>) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing <a href="/wiki/Microseism" title="Microseism">microseisms</a>. These pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power.</p>
<p>The waves propagate on the ocean surface, and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the <a href="/wiki/Group_velocity" title="Group velocity">group velocity</a>. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)" title="Plane (mathematics)">plane</a> of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is called the wave energy <a href="/wiki/Flux" title="Flux">flux</a> (or wave power, which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wave_power_formula">Wave power formula</span></h3>
<p>In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the <a href="/wiki/Wavelength" title="Wavelength">wavelength</a>, the wave <a href="/wiki/Energy_flux" title="Energy flux">energy flux</a> is</p>

<p>with <i>P</i> the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, <i>H</i><sub><i>m0</i></sub> the <a href="/wiki/Significant_wave_height" title="Significant wave height">significant wave height</a>, <i>T</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> the wave energy <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Period_(physics)" title="Period (physics)">period</a>, <i>ρ</i> the water <a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a> and <i>g</i> the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_gravity" title="Earth's gravity">acceleration by gravity</a>. The above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the <a href="/wiki/Square_(algebra)" title="Square (algebra)">square</a> of the wave height. When the significant wave height is given in metres, and the wave period in seconds, the result is the wave power in kilowatts (kW) per metre of <a href="/wiki/Wavefront" title="Wavefront">wavefront</a> length.</p>
<p>Example: Consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline, with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds. Using the formula to solve for power, we get</p>

<p>meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.</p>
<p>In major storms, the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7 MW of power across each metre of wavefront.</p>
<p>An effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux. As a result, the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wave_energy_and_wave-energy_flux">Wave energy and wave-energy flux</span></h3>
<p>In a <a href="/wiki/Sea_state" title="Sea state">sea state</a>, the average(mean) energy density per unit area of <a href="/wiki/Gravity_wave" title="Gravity wave">gravity waves</a> on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:</p>

<p>where <i>E</i> is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m), the sum of <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy" title="Potential energy">potential energy</a> density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy, both contributing half to the wave energy density <i>E</i>, as can be expected from the <a href="/wiki/Equipartition_theorem#Potential_energy_and_harmonic_oscillators" title="Equipartition theorem">equipartition theorem</a>. In ocean waves, surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few <a href="/wiki/Decimetre" title="Decimetre">decimetres</a>.</p>
<p>As the waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is the <a href="/wiki/Group_velocity" title="Group velocity">group velocity</a>. As a result, the wave energy <a href="/wiki/Flux" title="Flux">flux</a>, through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, is equal to:</p>

<p>with <i>c<sub>g</sub></i> the group velocity (m/s). Due to the <a href="/wiki/Dispersion_(water_waves)" title="Dispersion (water waves)">dispersion relation</a> for water waves under the action of gravity, the group velocity depends on the wavelength <i>λ</i>, or equivalently, on the wave <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Period_(physics)" title="Period (physics)">period</a> <i>T</i>. Further, the dispersion relation is a function of the water depth <i>h</i>. As a result, the group velocity behaves differently in the limits of deep and shallow water, and at intermediate depths:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deep-water_characteristics_and_opportunities">Deep-water characteristics and opportunities</span></h3>
<p>Deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength, which is the common situation in the sea and ocean. In deep water, longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster. The deep-water group velocity is half the <a href="/wiki/Phase_velocity" title="Phase velocity">phase velocity</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Waves_and_shallow_water" title="Waves and shallow water">shallow water</a>, for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth, as found quite often near the coast, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799, and was filed in Paris by <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Girard" title="Pierre-Simon Girard">Girard</a> and his son. An early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to light and power his house at <a href="/wiki/Royan" title="Royan">Royan</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in France. It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device. From 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the UK alone.</p>
<p>Modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Yoshio_Masuda" title="Yoshio Masuda">Yoshio Masuda</a>'s experiments in the 1940s. He has tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea, with several hundred units used to power navigation lights. Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft, which was proposed in the 1950s by Masuda.</p>
<p>A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the <a href="/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" title="1973 oil crisis">oil crisis in 1973</a>. A number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves, among whom notably were <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Salter" title="Stephen Salter">Stephen Salter</a> from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Kjell_Budal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Kjell Budal (page does not exist)">Kjell Budal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Falnes" title="Johannes Falnes">Johannes Falnes</a> from <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_Institute_of_Technology" title="Norwegian Institute of Technology">Norwegian Institute of Technology</a> (now merged into <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology" title="Norwegian University of Science and Technology">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a>), <a href="/wiki/Michael_E._McCormick" title="Michael E. McCormick">Michael E. McCormick</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Naval_Academy" title="U.S. Naval Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_Evans_(mathematician)" title="David Evans (mathematician)">David Evans</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bristol_University" title="Bristol University">Bristol University</a>, Michael French from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Lancaster" title="University of Lancaster">University of Lancaster</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Nicholas_Newman" title="John Nicholas Newman">Nick Newman</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/C._C._Mei" title="C. C. Mei">C. C. Mei</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT" title="MIT">MIT</a>.</p>
<p>Stephen Salter's <a href="/wiki/1974_in_science" title="1974 in science">1974 invention</a> became known as <a href="/wiki/Salter%27s_duck" title="Salter's duck">Salter's duck</a> or <i>nodding duck</i>, although it was officially referred to as the Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, as the oil price went down, wave-energy funding was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea. More recently, following the issue of climate change, there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy, including wave energy.</p>
<p>The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the <a class="external text" href="http://www.emec.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)</a> has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. It's grid connected wave test site is situated at Billia Croo, on the western edge of the Orkney mainland, and is subject to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site. Wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include <a class="external text" href="http://www.aquamarinepower.com/" rel="nofollow">Aquamarine Power</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://www.pelamiswave.com/" rel="nofollow">Pelamis Wave Power</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/wave-clients/scottishpower-renewables/" rel="nofollow">ScottishPower Renewables</a> and <a class="external text" href="http://www.wello.eu/" rel="nofollow">Wello</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_technology">Modern technology</span></h2>
<p>Wave power devices are generally categorized by the <b>method</b> used to capture the energy of the waves, by <b>location</b> and by the <b>power take-off system</b>. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_ram" title="Hydraulic ram">hydraulic ram</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peristaltic_pump" title="Peristaltic pump">elastomeric hose pump</a>, pump-to-shore, <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric turbine</a>, air turbine, and <a href="/wiki/Linear_motor" title="Linear motor">linear electrical generator</a>. When evaluating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wave_energy" title="Wave energy">wave energy</a> as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Point_absorber_buoy">Point absorber buoy</span></h3>
<p>This device floats on the surface of the <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, held in place by cables connected to the seabed. Buoys use the rise and fall of swells to drive hydraulic pumps and generate <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_field" title="Electromagnetic field">EMF</a> generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms. The presence of the buoys may affect fish, marine mammals, and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites. Potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines. Energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline, resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Surface_attenuator">Surface attenuator</span></h3>
<p>These devices act similarly to <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Point_absorber_buoy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Point absorber buoy (page does not exist)">point absorber buoys</a>, with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. Environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys, with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oscillating_wave_surge_converter">Oscillating wave surge converter</span></h3>
<p>These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">Energy</a> is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Environmental concerns include minor risk of collision, artificial reefing near the fixed point, <a href="/wiki/Electromotive_force" title="Electromotive force">EMF</a> effects from subsea cables, and energy removal effecting sediment transport. Some of these designs incorporate <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_reflector" title="Parabolic reflector">parabolic reflectors</a> as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture. These capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy. Once the wave energy is captured at a wave source, power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">electrical grid</a> by <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">transmission</a> <a href="/wiki/Submarine_power_cable" title="Submarine power cable">power cables</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oscillating_water_column">Oscillating water column</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Oscillating_Water_Column" title="Oscillating Water Column">Oscillating Water Column</a> devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore. With an air chamber integrated into the device, swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. Significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines, potentially affecting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Birds" title="Birds">birds</a> and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_organisms" title="Marine organisms">marine organisms</a> within the vicinity of the device. There is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overtopping_device">Overtopping device</span></h3>
<p>Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be either on shore or floating offshore. Floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Benthic_organism" title="Benthic organism">benthic organisms</a>, organisms becoming entangled, or EMF effects produced from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsea_cable" title="Subsea cable">subsea cables</a>. There is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Potential">Potential</span></h2>
<p>The worldwide resource of wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW. Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate_zones" title="Temperate zones">temperate zones</a> have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing <a href="/wiki/Westerlies" title="Westerlies">westerlies</a> in these zones blow strongest in winter.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Challenges">Challenges</span></h2>
<p>There is a potential impact on the marine environment. Noise pollution, for example, could have negative impact if not monitored, although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly. Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology is being studied. In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation. Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.</p>

The farm first generated electricity in July 2008 and was officially opened on September 23, 2008, by the Portuguese Minister of Economy. The wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in November 2008 as a result of the financial collapse of Babcock &amp; Brown due to the global economic crisis. The machines were off-site at this time due to technical problems, and although resolved have not returned to site and were subsequently scrapped in 2011 as the technology had moved on to the P2 variant as supplied to Eon and Scottish Power Renewables. A second phase of the project planned to increase the installed capacity to <span class="nowrap">21 MW</span> using a further 25 Pelamis machines is in doubt following Babcock's financial collapse.</li>
