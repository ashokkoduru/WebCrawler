<p><b>Thorium</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical element</a> with symbol <b>Th</b> and <a href="/wiki/Atomic_number" title="Atomic number">atomic number</a> 90. A <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive</a> <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinide</a> <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a>, thorium is one of only two significantly radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as a <a href="/wiki/Primordial_nuclide" title="Primordial nuclide">primordial element</a> (the other being <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>). It was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist <a href="/wiki/Morten_Thrane_Esmark" title="Morten Thrane Esmark">Morten Thrane Esmark</a> and identified by the Swedish chemist <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius" title="Jöns Jacob Berzelius">Jöns Jacob Berzelius</a>, who named it after <a href="/wiki/Thor" title="Thor">Thor</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Germanic_deities" title="List of Germanic deities">Norse god</a> of thunder.</p>
<p>A thorium atom has 90 <a href="/wiki/Proton" title="Proton">protons</a> and therefore 90 <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a>, of which four are <a href="/wiki/Valence_electron" title="Valence electron">valence electrons</a>. Thorium metal is silvery and <a href="/wiki/Tarnish" title="Tarnish">tarnishes</a> black when exposed to air, forming the dioxide. Thorium is weakly radioactive: all its known <a href="/wiki/Isotope" title="Isotope">isotopes</a> are unstable. Thorium-232 (Th), which has 142 <a href="/wiki/Neutron" title="Neutron">neutrons</a>, is the most stable isotope of thorium and accounts for nearly all natural thorium, with six other natural isotopes occurring only as <a href="/wiki/Trace_radioisotope" title="Trace radioisotope">trace radioisotopes</a>. Thorium has the longest half-life of all the significantly radioactive elements, 14.05 billion years; it decays very slowly through <a href="/wiki/Alpha_decay" title="Alpha decay">alpha decay</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radium-228" title="Radium-228">radium-228</a> (Ra), starting a <a href="/wiki/Decay_chain" title="Decay chain">decay chain</a> named the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thorium_series" title="Thorium series">thorium series</a> that ends at stable <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>-208 (Pb). Thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more <a href="/wiki/Natural_abundance" title="Natural abundance">abundant</a> than uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from <a href="/wiki/Monazite" title="Monazite">monazite</a> sands as a by-product of extracting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rare_earth_metal" title="Rare earth metal">rare earth metals</a>.</p>
<p>Thorium was once commonly used as the light source in <a href="/wiki/Gas_mantle" title="Gas mantle">gas mantles</a> and as an alloying material, but these applications have declined due to concerns about its radioactivity. Thorium is still widely used as an alloying element in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TIG_welding" title="TIG welding">TIG welding</a> electrodes (at a rate of 1–2% mix with tungsten). It remains popular as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation; thorium and uranium are the only significantly radioactive elements with major commercial applications that do not rely on their radioactivity. Thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium as nuclear fuel in <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactors</a>, but only a few <a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle#Reactors" title="Thorium fuel cycle">thorium reactors</a> have yet been completed.</p>

<p>Thorium is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hardness_(materials_science)" title="Hardness (materials science)">soft</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paramagnetism" title="Paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a>, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a>, it is located to the right of the actinide <a href="/wiki/Actinium" title="Actinium">actinium</a>, to the left of the actinide <a href="/wiki/Protactinium" title="Protactinium">protactinium</a>, and below the <a href="/wiki/Lanthanide" title="Lanthanide">lanthanide</a> <a href="/wiki/Cerium" title="Cerium">cerium</a>. Pure thorium is very <a href="/wiki/Ductility" title="Ductility">ductile</a> and, as normal for metals, can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cold-rolling#Cold_rolling" title="Cold-rolling">cold-rolled</a>, <a href="/wiki/Swaging" title="Swaging">swaged</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Drawing_(manufacturing)" title="Drawing (manufacturing)">drawn</a>. At room temperature, thorium metal has a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Face-centred_cubic" title="Face-centred cubic">face-centred cubic</a> crystal structure; additionally, it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360 °C; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Body-centred_cubic" title="Body-centred cubic">body-centred cubic</a>) and one at high pressure (around 100 GPa; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Body-centred_tetragonal" title="Body-centred tetragonal">body-centred tetragonal</a>).</p>
<p>The properties of thorium vary widely depending on the amount of impurities in the sample: the major impurity is usually <a href="/wiki/Thorium_dioxide" title="Thorium dioxide">thorium dioxide</a> (ThO<sub>2</sub>). The purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5 and 11.66 g/cm: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7 g/cm calculated from thorium's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lattice_parameter" title="Lattice parameter">lattice parameters</a>, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie intermediate between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1 g/cm) and protactinium (15.4 g/cm), showing the continuity of trends across the early actinides.</p>
<p>Thorium's melting point of 1750 °C is above both that of actinium (1227 °C) and that of protactinium (approximately 1560 °C). In the beginning of period 7, from <a href="/wiki/Francium" title="Francium">francium</a> to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (following the trend in the other periods): this is because the number of delocalised electrons that each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, and there is a greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one in francium to four in thorium. After thorium, there is a new smooth trend downward in the melting points of the early actinides from thorium to <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> where the number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6, due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals, increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal resulting in increasingly complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium is listed as a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density (second only to actinium) Its boiling point of 4788 °C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points, behind only <a href="/wiki/Osmium" title="Osmium">osmium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tantalum" title="Tantalum">tantalum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tungsten" title="Tungsten">tungsten</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rhenium" title="Rhenium">rhenium</a>.</p>
<p>Thorium has a <a href="/wiki/Bulk_modulus" title="Bulk modulus">bulk modulus</a> of 54 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigapascal" title="Gigapascal">GPa</a>, comparable to those of <a href="/wiki/Tin" title="Tin">tin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scandium" title="Scandium">scandium</a>. The hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a>, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Nevertheless, while thorium is nearly half as dense as <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and plutonium, it is harder than either of them. Thorium becomes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superconductor" title="Superconductor">superconductive</a> below 1.4 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a>.</p>
<p>Thorium can also form <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloys</a> with many other metals. Addition of small amounts of thorium improves the mechanical strength of <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>, and thorium-<a href="/wiki/Aluminium" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a> alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. With <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a> and uranium, it forms <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eutectic_mixture" title="Eutectic mixture">eutectic mixtures</a>, and thorium is completely <a href="/wiki/Miscibility" title="Miscibility">miscible</a> in both solid and liquid <a href="/wiki/State_of_matter" title="State of matter">states</a> with its lighter <a href="/wiki/Congener_(chemistry)" title="Congener (chemistry)">congener</a> cerium.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Isotopes">Isotopes</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_thorium" title="Isotopes of thorium">Isotopes of thorium</a></div>

<p>Although every element up to <a href="/wiki/Bismuth" title="Bismuth">bismuth</a> (element 83) has an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions of <a href="/wiki/Technetium" title="Technetium">technetium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Promethium" title="Promethium">promethium</a> (elements 43 and 61), all elements from <a href="/wiki/Polonium" title="Polonium">polonium</a> (element 84) onward are noticeably radioactive. Of these, thorium (element 90) is the most stable, closely followed by uranium (element 92): the isotope Th has a half-life of 14.05 billion years, about three times the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Age_of_the_earth" title="Age of the earth">age of the earth</a>, and even slightly longer than the generally accepted <a href="/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" title="Age of the universe">age of the universe</a> (about 13.8 billion years). As such, Th still occurs naturally today: four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. Thorium and uranium are thus the most well-studied of all the radioactive elements.</p>
<p>The heaviest three primordial nuclides, Th, <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">U</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">U</a>, are the only isotopes beyond bismuth that have half-lives measured in billions of years. Thus, they are the only such heavy isotopes to have survived since their production around ten billion years ago. Hence, thorium and uranium are the only important <a href="/wiki/Primordial_nuclide" title="Primordial nuclide">primordial</a> radioactive elements. Even then, the half-life of Th is only a billionth that of Bi, the last classically stable nuclide. Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in significant quantities in nature today, and thus thorium is usually considered to be a <a href="/wiki/Mononuclidic_element" title="Mononuclidic element">mononuclidic element</a>. The reason for the existence of this "island of relative stability" at thorium and uranium, where the longest-lived isotopes have half-lives of millions or billions of years, is because the most stable isotopes of these elements have closed nuclear shells; nevertheless, since thorium and uranium have more protons than bismuth, their nuclei are thus still susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Alpha_decay" title="Alpha decay">alpha decay</a> because the strong nuclear force is not strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons.</p>
<p>Th is the longest-lived isotope in the 4<i>n</i> decay chain which includes isotopes with a <a href="/wiki/Mass_number" title="Mass number">mass number</a> divisible by 4 (hence the name: it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor). The chain begins with the alpha decay of Th to Ra, and terminates at stable Pb. (Th very occasionally undergoes <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_fission" title="Spontaneous fission">spontaneous fission</a> rather than alpha decay, and has left evidence in doing so in its minerals, but the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Partial_half-life" title="Partial half-life">partial half-life</a> of this process is very large at over 10 years and hence alpha decay predominates.) Because Th is so long-lived, its daughters still exist in nature as <a href="/wiki/Radiogenic_nuclide" title="Radiogenic nuclide">radiogenic nuclides</a> despite their much shorter half-lives, the longest among them being the 5.7-year half-life of Ra, the immediate alpha daughter of Th. Any sample of thorium or its compounds contain traces of these daughters, which are isotopes of <a href="/wiki/Thallium" title="Thallium">thallium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>, bismuth, polonium, <a href="/wiki/Radon" title="Radon">radon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Radium" title="Radium">radium</a>, and actinium. As such, natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract its useful daughter nuclides, such as Pb, which is used in <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_medicine" title="Nuclear medicine">nuclear medicine</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cancer_therapy" title="Cancer therapy">cancer therapy</a>.</p>
<p>Thirty <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioisotope" title="Radioisotope">radioisotopes</a> have been characterised, which range in mass number from 209 to 238. The most stable of them (after Th) are Th with a half-life of 75,380 years, Th with a half-life of 7,340 years, Th with a half-life of 1.92 years, Th with a half-life of 24.10 days, and Th with a half-life of 18.68 days: all of these isotopes occur in nature as <a href="/wiki/Trace_radioisotope" title="Trace radioisotope">trace radioisotopes</a> due to their presence in the decay chains of Th, U, U, and Np (produced in minute traces in nuclear reactions in uranium ores). All of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>In deep <a href="/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">seawaters</a> the isotope Th becomes significant enough that the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry" title="International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013, as it can then make up to 0.04% of natural thorium, with Th being the remainder. The reason for this is that while its parent U is soluble in water, Th is insoluble and thus precipitates to form part of the sediment, and may be observed doing so. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the Th isotope, since Th is one of the daughters of U. Thorium thus has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, and so an <a href="/wiki/Atomic_mass" title="Atomic mass">atomic mass</a> can be given, which is 232.0377(4) <a href="/wiki/Unified_atomic_mass_unit" title="Unified atomic mass unit">u</a>. Thorium is one of only three significantly radioactive elements (the others being protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for this to be possible.</p>
<p>Thorium also has three known <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_isomer" title="Nuclear isomer">nuclear isomers</a> (or metastable states), Th, Th, and Th. Th has the lowest known <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Excitation_energy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Excitation energy (page does not exist)">excitation energy</a> of any isomer, measured to be (7.6 ± 0.5) eV. This is so low that when it undergoes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isomeric_transition" title="Isomeric transition">isomeric transition</a>, the emitted gamma radiation is in the <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> range.</p>
<p>In the early history of the study of radioactivity, the different natural isotopes of thorium were given different names. In this scheme, Th was named radioactinium (RdAc), Th radiothorium (RdTh), Th ionium (Io), Th uranium Y (UY), Th thorium (Th), and Th uranium X1 (UX<sub>1</sub>). This reflects that Th and Th occur in the decay chain of natural U (the actinium series), Th occurs in the decay chain of Th (the thorium series), and that Th occurs in the decay chain of U (the uranium or radium series). The remaining natural thorium isotope, Th, occurs in minute traces as part of the decay chain of Np, the neptunium series, which is much less abundant than the other decay chains in nature and was hence discovered much later: therefore it does not have a historical name. When it was realised that all of these are isotopes of thorium, many of these names fell out of use, and "thorium" came to refer to all isotopes, not just Th. The name ionium is still encountered for Th in the context of <a href="/wiki/Ionium-thorium_dating" title="Ionium-thorium dating">ionium-thorium dating</a>.</p>
<p>Different isotopes of thorium behave identically chemically, but have slightly differing physical properties: for example, the densities of isotopically pure Th, Th, Th, and Th in g/cm are respectively expected to be 11.5, 11.6, 11.6, and 11.7. The isotope Th is expected to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissionable" title="Fissionable">fissionable</a> with a bare <a href="/wiki/Critical_mass" title="Critical mass">critical mass</a> of 2839 kg, although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994 kg. While Th is not fissionable, it is <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile</a> as it can be converted to fissile <a href="/wiki/Uranium-233" title="Uranium-233">U</a> using <a href="/wiki/Neutron_capture" title="Neutron capture">neutron capture</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Radiometric_dating">Radiometric dating</span></h3>
<p>Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: <a href="/wiki/Uranium-thorium_dating" title="Uranium-thorium dating">uranium-thorium dating</a>, involving the decay of <a href="/wiki/Uranium-234" title="Uranium-234">U</a> to Th (ionium), and ionium-thorium dating, which measures the ratio of Th to Th. These rely on the fact that Th is a primordial radioisotope, but Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of U. Uranium-thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of U and Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of U into Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium-thorium dating. Uranium-thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of <a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" title="Calcium carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> materials such as <a href="/wiki/Speleothem" title="Speleothem">speleothem</a> or <a href="/wiki/Coral" title="Coral">coral</a>, because while uranium is rather soluble in water, thorium and protactinium are not, and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor <a href="/wiki/Sediment" title="Sediment">sediments</a>, from which their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium-thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both Th and Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of Th to Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of Th to Th is a constant during the time period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot shift within the sediment layer.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Compounds_of_thorium" title="Compounds of thorium">Compounds of thorium</a></div>

<p>A thorium atom has 90 electrons, of which four are <a href="/wiki/Valence_electron" title="Valence electron">valence electrons</a>. Three <a href="/wiki/Atomic_orbital" title="Atomic orbital">atomic orbitals</a> are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-block" title="F-block">f-block</a> of the periodic table, it has an anomalous [Rn]6d7s electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Relativistic_effects" title="Relativistic effects">relativistic effects</a>, which are increasingly stronger near the bottom of the periodic table, specifically the relativistic <a href="/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93orbit_interaction" title="Spin–orbit interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a>. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four of its valence electrons and hence occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This behaviour is quite distinct from that of its lanthanide congener cerium, for whom +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Therefore, thorium is much more similar to the <a href="/wiki/Transition_metal" title="Transition metal">transition metals</a> zirconium and hafnium than to its true lanthanide congener cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry.</p>
<p>Despite this anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms, however, metallic thorium atoms show significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, when it was pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the [Rn]6d7s configuration with the 5f orbitals above the <a href="/wiki/Fermi_level" title="Fermi level">Fermi level</a> should be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hexagonal_close_packed" title="Hexagonal close packed">hexagonal close packed</a> like the <a href="/wiki/Group_4_element" title="Group 4 element">group 4 elements</a> titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centered cubic as it actually is. Indeed, the correct crystal structure can only be obtained when the 5f states are included, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically with the clear influence of the 5f orbitals. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration [Rn]5f.</p>
<p>Tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow, like those of <a href="/wiki/Silver" title="Silver">silver</a> or lead, as the Th ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is slight enough to not pose major problems of handling and accessibility and they may be safely handled in a normal laboratory.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactivity">Reactivity</span></h3>
<p>Thorium is a highly <a href="/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)" title="Reactivity (chemistry)">reactive</a> and electropositive metal. Finely divided thorium metal presents a fire hazard due to its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pyrophoric" title="Pyrophoric">pyrophoricity</a> and must therefore be handled carefully. When heated in air, thorium <a href="/wiki/Swarf" title="Swarf">turnings</a> ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.</p>
<p>At <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Standard_temperature_and_pressure" title="Standard temperature and pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>, thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, where it dissolves leaving behind a black insoluble residue, probably ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a> containing a small amount of catalytic <a href="/wiki/Fluoride" title="Fluoride">fluoride</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fluorosilicate" title="Fluorosilicate">fluorosilicate</a> ions; if these are not present, <a href="/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)" title="Passivation (chemistry)">passivation</a> can occur, similarly to uranium and plutonium.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Inorganic_compounds">Inorganic compounds</span></h3>

<p>Most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may simply be prepared by heating the elements together. In air, thorium burns to form the simple dioxide, ThO<sub>2</sub>, also called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thoria" title="Thoria">thoria</a> or thorina: this has the <a href="/wiki/Fluorite" title="Fluorite">fluorite</a> structure. Thoria, a refractory material, has the highest <a href="/wiki/Melting_point" title="Melting point">melting point</a> (3390 °C) of all known oxides. It is somewhat <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hygroscopic" title="Hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> and reacts readily with water and many gases, but dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride. When heated, it emits intense blue light through <a href="/wiki/Incandescence" title="Incandescence">incandescence</a>, which becomes white when mixed with its lighter homologue <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cerium_dioxide" title="Cerium dioxide">cerium dioxide</a> (CeO<sub>2</sub>, ceria): this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles. Several binary thorium <a href="/wiki/Chalcogen" title="Chalcogen">chalcogenides</a> and oxychalcogenides are also known with <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Selenium" title="Selenium">selenium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tellurium" title="Tellurium">tellurium</a>.</p>

<p>All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as are some low-valent bromides and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Additionally, many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a <a href="/wiki/Monoclinic_crystal_system" title="Monoclinic crystal system">monoclinic</a> crystal structure and is isotypic with <a href="/wiki/Zirconium_tetrafluoride" title="Zirconium tetrafluoride">zirconium tetrafluoride</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hafnium_tetrafluoride" title="Hafnium tetrafluoride">hafnium tetrafluoride</a>, where the Th ions are coordinated with F ions in somewhat distorted <a href="/wiki/Square_antiprism" title="Square antiprism">square antiprisms</a>. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI<sub>3</sub> (black) and ThI<sub>2</sub> (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: These do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th and could be more clearly formulated as <a href="/wiki/Electride" title="Electride">electride</a> compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, <a href="/wiki/Barium" title="Barium">barium</a>, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with <a href="/wiki/Potassium_fluoride" title="Potassium fluoride">potassium fluoride</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid" title="Hydrofluoric acid">hydrofluoric acid</a>, Th forms the complex anion <span class="chemf nowrap">ThF<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left">2−<br/>
6</span></span>, which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K<sub>2</sub>ThF<sub>6</sub>.</p>
<p>Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and nitrides are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Refractory_material" title="Refractory material">refractory materials</a>, as are those of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuels</a>. All four heavier <a href="/wiki/Pnictogen" title="Pnictogen">pnictogens</a> (<a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antimony" title="Antimony">antimony</a>, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH<sub>2</sub> and Th<sub>4</sub>H<sub>15</sub>, the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7.5–8 K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. They are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coordination_compounds">Coordination compounds</span></h3>
<p>In acidic aqueous solution, thorium occurs as the tetrapositive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aqua_ion" title="Aqua ion">aqua ion</a> [Th(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>9</sub>], which has <a href="/wiki/Tricapped_trigonal_prismatic_molecular_geometry" title="Tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry">tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry</a>: at pH &lt; 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation. The Th ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than <a href="/wiki/Sulfurous_acid" title="Sulfurous acid">sulfurous acid</a>: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">Fe</a>), predominantly to [Th<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>] in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)<sub>4</sub> is formed and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down significantly just before the precipitation). As a <a href="/wiki/HSAB_theory" title="HSAB theory">hard Lewis acid</a>, Th favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.</p>
<p>Large coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size. Thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride (first prepared in the <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Project" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>) has coordination number 14. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.</p>
<p>Many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, such as the <a href="/wiki/Perchlorate" title="Perchlorate">perchlorates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfate" title="Sulfate">sulfates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfite" title="Sulfite">sulfites</a>, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, <a href="/wiki/Vanadate" title="Vanadate">vanadates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molybdate" title="Molybdate">molybdates</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chromate" title="Chromate">chromates</a>, and their hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but most of them have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as <a href="/wiki/Oxalate" title="Oxalate">oxalate</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Citrate" title="Citrate">citrate</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EDTA" title="EDTA">EDTA</a>, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Organothorium_compounds">Organothorium compounds</span></h3>


<p>Most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the <a href="/wiki/Cyclopentadienyl" title="Cyclopentadienyl">cyclopentadienyls</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cyclooctatetraenide_anion" title="Cyclooctatetraenide anion">cyclooctatetraenyls</a>. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to <a href="/wiki/Americium" title="Americium">americium</a>, and also expected for <a href="/wiki/Curium" title="Curium">curium</a>), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, thorocene. It is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isotypic" title="Isotypic">isotypic</a> with the better-known analogous uranium compound, <a href="/wiki/Uranocene" title="Uranocene">uranocene</a>. It can be prepared by reacting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potassium_cyclooctatetraenide" title="Potassium cyclooctatetraenide">K<sub>2</sub>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub></a> with thorium tetrachloride in <a href="/wiki/Tetrahydrofuran" title="Tetrahydrofuran">tetrahydrofuran</a> (THF) at the temperature of <a href="/wiki/Dry_ice" title="Dry ice">dry ice</a>, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>. It is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190 °C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (<i>η</i>-C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)ThCl<sub>2</sub>(THF)<sub>2</sub>, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.</p>
<p>The simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are Th(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and Th(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>: many derivatives are known. The former (which has two forms, one purple and one green) is a rare example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state; a formal +2 oxidation state even occurs in a derivative. The chloride derivative [Th(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl] is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with <a href="/wiki/Limiting_reagent" title="Limiting reagent">limiting</a> K(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) used (other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used). The <a href="/wiki/Alkyl" title="Alkyl">alkyl</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aryl" title="Aryl">aryl</a> derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have received attention due to the insight they give regarding the nature of the Th–C <a href="/wiki/Sigma_bond" title="Sigma bond">sigma bond</a>.</p>
<p>Other organothorium compounds are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, are known, but their structures have not yet been determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion [Th(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>7</sub>], heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt [Li(tmeda)]<sub>3</sub>[ThMe<sub>7</sub>] (tmeda = Me<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NMe<sub>2</sub>). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1 pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5 pm) they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, is not known, but its <a href="/wiki/Adduct" title="Adduct">adducts</a> are stabilised by <a href="/wiki/Phosphine" title="Phosphine">phosphine</a> ligands.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Formation">Formation</span></h3>
<p>Th is a primordial nuclide, having existed in its current form for over ten billion years; it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the <a href="/wiki/R-process" title="R-process">r-process</a> and scattered across the galaxy by <a href="/wiki/Supernova" title="Supernova">supernovae</a>. The letter "r" stands for "rapid neutron capture", and occurs in core-collapse supernovae, where heavy seed nuclei such as <a href="/wiki/Iron-56" title="Iron-56">Fe</a> rapidly capture neutrons, running up against the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neutron_drip_line" title="Neutron drip line">neutron drip line</a>, as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can <a href="/wiki/Beta_decay" title="Beta decay">beta decay</a> back toward stability. Neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased <a href="/wiki/Coulomb_barrier" title="Coulomb barrier">Coulomb barriers</a> that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond Fe is endothermic. Because of the abrupt loss of stability past Bi, the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create isotopes of thorium and uranium, because all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>In the universe, thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements: it achieves this position not only because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process (with the other one being uranium), but also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are <a href="/wiki/Thulium" title="Thulium">thulium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lutetium" title="Lutetium">lutetium</a>, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Furthermore, neutron capture by nuclides beyond the end of the line of beta stability at <i>A</i> = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become thorium. On Earth, thorium is much more abundant: with an abundance of 8.1 ppm in the Earth's crust, it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13 ppm) and significantly more abundant than tin (2.1 ppm). This is because thorium, being a <a href="/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification" title="Goldschmidt classification">lithophile</a>, is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core. On the other hand, the heavy platinum group metals have no affinity for oxygen and their oxides may even be thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elements. Instead, readily dissolve in iron and sink down with it into the core. Furthermore, thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="On_Earth">On Earth</span></h3>

<p>Natural thorium is essentially isotopically pure Th, which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe. Its <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> produces a significant amount of the <a href="/wiki/Earth#Heat" title="Earth">Earth's internal heat</a>; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial nuclides, U, U, and K. The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only Th is usually detectable, occurring in <a href="/wiki/Secular_equilibrium" title="Secular equilibrium">secular equilibrium</a> with its parent U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.</p>
<p>On Earth, thorium is not a rare element as was previously thought, having a crustal abundance comparable to that of lead and <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, twice that of arsenic, and thrice that of tin. Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">parts per million</a> (ppm) of thorium.</p>
<p>In nature, thorium occurs in the +4 oxidation state, together with uranium(IV), <a href="/wiki/Zirconium" title="Zirconium">zirconium</a>(IV), hafnium(IV), and cerium(IV), but also with scandium, yttrium, and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar <a href="/wiki/Ionic_radius" title="Ionic radius">ionic radii</a>. Because of thorium's radioactivity, minerals containing significant quantities of thorium are often <a href="/wiki/Metamictization" title="Metamictization">metamict</a>, their crystal structure having been partially or totally destroyed by the alpha radiation produced in the radioactive decay of thorium. An extreme example is <a href="/wiki/Ekanite" title="Ekanite">ekanite</a>, (Ca,Fe,Pb)<sub>2</sub>(Th,U)Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>20</sub>, which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to thorium being an essential part of its chemical composition.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Monazite" title="Monazite">Monazite</a> is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide, principally in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. It contains around 2.5% thorium on average, although some deposits may contain up to 20% thorium. Monazite is a chemically unreactive <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a> mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand; its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it. <a href="/wiki/Allanite" title="Allanite">Allanite</a> can have 0.1–2% thorium and <a href="/wiki/Zircon" title="Zircon">zircon</a> up to 0.4% thorium.</p>
<p>Thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral <a href="/wiki/Thorianite" title="Thorianite">thorianite</a>, which usually contains up to 12% ThO<sub>2</sub>. Due to its being isotypic with <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a>, these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the ThO<sub>2</sub> content. Thorite, or <a href="/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system" title="Tetragonal crystal system">tetragonal</a> <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Thorium_silicate&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Thorium silicate (page does not exist)">thorium silicate</a> (ThSiO<sub>4</sub>), also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered. In thorium silicate minerals, the Th and <span class="chemf nowrap">SiO<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left">4−<br/>

4</span></span>) ions respectively. Because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide, thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released in significant quantities: the Th ion is soluble, especially in acidic soils, and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40 ppm.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>In 1815, the Swedish chemist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jakob_Berzelius" title="Jöns Jakob Berzelius">Jöns Jakob Berzelius</a> analysed an unusual sample of <a href="/wiki/Gadolinite" title="Gadolinite">gadolinite</a> from a copper mine in <a href="/wiki/Falun" title="Falun">Falun</a>, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces of a white mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (<a href="/wiki/Oxide" title="Oxide">oxide</a> in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. (By that time, Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but he had made a public mistake once, announcing a new element, <i>gahnium</i>, that turned out to be simply <a href="/wiki/Zinc_oxide" title="Zinc oxide">zinc oxide</a>.) Berzelius privately named the supposed tentative element "thorium" in 1817 and its supposed oxide "thorina" after <a href="/wiki/Thor" title="Thor">Thor</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norse_god" title="Norse god">Norse god</a> of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in Vest-Agder, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral in question proved to actually be an <a href="/wiki/Yttrium" title="Yttrium">yttrium</a> mineral, primarily composed of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yttrium_phosphate" title="Yttrium phosphate">yttrium orthophosphate</a>. As the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken as being a new element, the mineral was named kenotime by the French mineralogist <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Sulpice_Beudant" title="François Sulpice Beudant">François Sulpice Beudant</a> as a rebuke of Berzelius, from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> words κενός (vain) and τιμή (honour). This became "<a href="/wiki/Xenotime" title="Xenotime">xenotime</a>" as a misprint from the beginning, blunting the criticism. This misspelt form was later explained as being from ξενός (stranger to) and τιμή (honour), supposedly referencing the small, rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as.</p>
<p>In 1828, <a href="/wiki/Morten_Thrane_Esmark" title="Morten Thrane Esmark">Morten Thrane Esmark</a> found a black mineral on <a href="/wiki/L%C3%B8v%C3%B8ya,_Telemark" title="Løvøya, Telemark">Løvøya</a> island, <a href="/wiki/Telemark" title="Telemark">Telemark</a> county, Norway. He was a Norwegian <a href="/wiki/Priest" title="Priest">priest</a> and amateur <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mineralogist" title="Mineralogist">mineralogist</a> who studied the minerals in Telemark, where he served as <a href="/wiki/Vicar" title="Vicar">vicar</a>. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, <a href="/wiki/Jens_Esmark" title="Jens Esmark">Jens Esmark</a>, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oslo" title="University of Oslo">University of Oslo</a>. The elder Esmark determined that it was not any known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample for the first time by reducing KThF<sub>5</sub> with <a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a> metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery. Thus, he named the source mineral <a href="/wiki/Thorite" title="Thorite">thorite</a>, which has the chemical composition (Th,U)<a href="/wiki/Silicate" title="Silicate">SiO<sub>4</sub></a>. Berzelius also made some initial characterisation of the new metal and its chemical compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and as such assumed that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit" title="Atomic mass unit">amu</a>), while it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, that he placed ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Berzelius did not isolate the element in its metallic state; for the first time, thorium was isolated in 1914 by D. Lely Jr. and L. Hamburger. They obtained 99% pure thorium metal by reducing thorium chloride with sodium metal. A simpler method leading to even higher purity was discovered in 1927 by Marden and Rentschler, involving the reduction of thorium oxide with calcium when calcium chloride was present.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev" title="Dmitri Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a>'s 1869 periodic table, thorium and the <a href="/wiki/Rare_earth_element" title="Rare earth element">rare earth elements</a> were placed outside the main body of the table, at the end of each vertical period after the <a href="/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal" title="Alkaline earth metal">alkaline earth metals</a>. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern <a href="/wiki/Carbon_group" title="Carbon group">carbon group</a> (group 14), <a href="/wiki/Group_4_element" title="Group 4 element">titanium group</a> (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series, while thorium remained with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as <a href="/wiki/Titanium" title="Titanium">titanium</a> and zirconium.</p>
<p>Although thorium was discovered in 1828, it had no applications until 1885, when <a href="/wiki/Carl_Auer_von_Welsbach" title="Carl Auer von Welsbach">Carl Auer von Welsbach</a> invented the <a href="/wiki/Gas_mantle" title="Gas mantle">gas mantle</a>, a portable source of light which produces light from the <a href="/wiki/Incandescence" title="Incandescence">incandescence</a> of very hot thorium oxide, heated to extremely high temperatures by burning gaseous fuels. After 1885, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, such as in ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.</p>

<p>In the late 19th century onward, the <a href="/wiki/Atomic_theory" title="Atomic theory">atomic theory</a> underwent significant improvements, which shaped the further history of thorium. Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, independently, by the German chemist <a href="/wiki/Gerhard_Carl_Schmidt" title="Gerhard Carl Schmidt">Gerhard Carl Schmidt</a> and later that year, the Polish-French physicist <a href="/wiki/Marie_Curie" title="Marie Curie">Marie Curie</a>. It was the second element that was found to be radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by <a href="/wiki/Henri_Becquerel" title="Henri Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a>. Between 1900 and 1903, <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford" title="Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Soddy" title="Frederick Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a> showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a> as one of the outcomes of the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_particle" title="Alpha particle">alpha particle</a> experiments that led to their disintegration theory of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactivity" title="Radioactivity">radioactivity</a>. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903; the danger presented by radioactivity to health and environment was the reason thorium was phased out of use in applications that did not explicitly use the radioactivity. By the 1930s, it has been widely acknowledged that thorium possesses a minor threat to human organisms in large quantities.</p>
<p>In 1922, <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> published a <a href="/wiki/Bohr_model" title="Bohr model">theoretical model</a> of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements, like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals. Such a second extra-long periodic table row, to accommodate known and undiscovered elements with an atomic weight greater than bismuth (thorium, protactinium, and uranium, for example), had been postulated as far back as 1892 by Henry Bassett, who considered thorium and uranium to be members of a second series of rare earths, and predicted that more elements would be found within this series. Most investigators considered on the basis of their chemical properties that these elements were analogous to the 5d transition elements hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, and considered the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row to be a one-off fluke. The existence of a second inner transition series, in the form of the actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established. It was only with the discovery of the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic_element" title="Transuranic element">transuranic elements</a>, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states (neptunium having +4 and +5 as dominant states and +7 as an unstable state), that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals. Thus it was not until 1945, after <a href="/wiki/Glenn_T._Seaborg" title="Glenn T. Seaborg">Glenn T. Seaborg</a> and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, that Seaborg realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of <a href="/wiki/Hafnium" title="Hafnium">hafnium</a> and filling a fourth d-block row. Today, thorium's similarities to hafnium are still sometimes acknowledged by calling it a "pseudo group-4 element".</p>
<p>Despite thorium's radioactivity, the element has remained in use for a long time for applications not exploiting the effect as no suitable alternatives could be found. While a 1981 study estimated that a dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, this was not the case for people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) as well as soils around some factory sites. A major shift occurred as late as in the 1990s, when most of these applications that do not depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements have been found. Due to concerns, some manufacturers have switched to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continue to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a>. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some even fraudulently claiming them to be non-radioactive while in reality using large quantities of thorium, up to 259 milligrams per mantle.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle#List_of_thorium-fueled_reactors" title="Thorium fuel cycle">Efforts</a> have been applied to initiate usage of thorium and its radioactivity as a power source; the earliest thorium-based reactor was made in India: the first core at the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Point_Energy_Center" title="Indian Point Energy Center">Indian Point Energy Center</a> in 1962. India has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world but does not have much uranium used elsewhere, and targeted in the 1950s at achieving energy independence for the country with their <a href="/wiki/India%27s_three-stage_nuclear_power_programme" title="India's three-stage nuclear power programme">three-stage nuclear power programme</a>. On the other hand, in most countries, the progress staggered because uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was therefore slow (in the 20th century, 3 reactors were opened in India and 12 elsewhere). Large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the <a href="/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" title="International Atomic Energy Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) to study the use of thorium reactors; a year later, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">U.S. Energy Department</a> began their research on the matter.

<p>Sometimes thorium is extracted by <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800 °C in a <a href="/wiki/Graphite" title="Graphite">graphite</a> crucible. Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_bar_process" title="Crystal bar process">crystal bar process</a>.</p>
<p>Since thorium has few applications today, only a few hundred tonnes of it are produced each year, mostly as a by-product of the production of uranium and the lanthanides, and even these meagre quantities exceed the current demand for thorium. Half of this thorium produced is used in gas mantles. Nevertheless, production could easily be increased, and probably would be if thorium became used in large quantities as nuclear fuel. Present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively low-key exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Applications">Applications</span></h2>
<p>Many applications of thorium are becoming obsolete due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products. Thorium is thus being phased out of many of its uses.</p>
<p>Thorium is used in <a href="/wiki/Gas_tungsten_arc_welding" title="Gas tungsten arc welding">gas tungsten arc welding</a> (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. In electronic equipment, thorium coating of tungsten wire improves the electron <a href="/wiki/Thermionic_emission" title="Thermionic emission">emission</a> of heated <a href="/wiki/Cathode" title="Cathode">cathodes</a>.</p>
<p>Thorium is added to tungsten because it lowers the effective <a href="/wiki/Work_function" title="Work function">work function</a> with the result that the thoriated tungsten <a href="/wiki/Hot_cathode" title="Hot cathode">thermocathode</a> emits electrons at considerably lower temperatures. This is used in thoriated tungsten elements found in the <a href="/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Filament" title="Incandescent light bulb">filaments</a> of <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_tube" title="Vacuum tube">vacuum tubes</a>, e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnetron" title="Magnetron">magnetron</a> found in <a href="/wiki/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave oven</a>.</p>
<p>Many applications of thorium use, rather than the metal, its dioxide, commonly called "thoria" in the industry. The melting point of thoria is 3300 °C – the highest of all known oxides; only few substances have higher melting points. This means that when heated to high temperatures, it does not melt, but merely glows with an intense blue light; addition of cerium dioxide gives a bright white light. Sometimes thorium nitrate is used instead, because it will thermally decompose to thoria at high temperatures. This property of thoria is used in mantles of portable gas lights, including natural gas lamps, oil lamps and camping lights. Additionally, thoria is a material for <a href="/wiki/Refraction_(metallurgy)" title="Refraction (metallurgy)">heat-resistant</a> ceramics, as used in high-temperature laboratory <a href="/wiki/Crucible" title="Crucible">crucibles</a>.</p>

<p>When added to <a href="/wiki/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a>, thoria helps increase <a href="/wiki/Refractive_index" title="Refractive index">refractive index</a> and decrease <a href="/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)" title="Dispersion (optics)">dispersion</a>. Such glass finds application in high-quality <a href="/wiki/Lens_(optics)" title="Lens (optics)">lenses</a> for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state with lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>Thoria has been used as a chemical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> in the conversion of <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> to nitric acid, in <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> <a href="/wiki/Cracking_(chemistry)" title="Cracking (chemistry)">cracking</a> and in producing <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a>.</p>
<p>Thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings. It has an optical transparency in the range of 0.35–12 µm, and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material. Thorium tetrafluoride was also used in manufacturing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_arc_lamp" title="Carbon arc lamp">carbon arc lamps</a>, which provided high-intensity illumination for movie projectors and search lights.</p>

<p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_breeder_reactor" title="Thermal breeder reactor">thermal breeder reactors</a>, the fertile isotope Th is bombarded by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slow_neutron" title="Slow neutron">slow neutrons</a>, undergoing neutron capture to become Th, which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protactinium-233" title="Protactinium-233">Pa</a> and then the fissile U:</p>


<p>U is fissile and hence can be used as a nuclear fuel in much the same way as the more-commonly used U or <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">Pu</a>. When U undergoes nuclear fission, the neutrons emitted can strike further Th nuclei, restarting the cycle. This closely parallels the uranium fuel cycle in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_breeder_reactor" title="Fast breeder reactor">fast breeder reactors</a> where U undergoes neutron capture to become U, beta decaying to first Np and then fissile Pu. The main advantage of the thorium fuel cycle is that thorium is more abundant than uranium and hence can satisfy world energy demands for longer. Furthermore, Th absorbs neutrons more readily than U, and not only does U have a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0%) than U (85.5%) or Pu (73.5%), it also releases more neutrons upon fission on average. An added advantage U and Pu enjoy over all other fissile nuclei (except the naturally occurring U) is that they can be <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">bred</a> from neutron capture by the naturally-occurring quantity isotopes Th and U. Thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactor_core" title="Reactor core">reactor core</a> because thoria has a higher melting point, higher <a href="/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" title="Thermal conductivity">thermal conductivity</a>, and lower <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion" title="Coefficient of thermal expansion">coefficient of thermal expansion</a> than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>): thoria is also more <a href="/wiki/Chemical_stability" title="Chemical stability">chemically stable</a> as, unlike uranium dioxide, it does not further oxidise to <a href="/wiki/Triuranium_octoxide" title="Triuranium octoxide">triuranium octoxide</a> (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). Furthermore, while a single neutron capture by U would produce transuranic waste, along with it fissile Pu, five captures are generally necessary to do so from Th. 98–99% of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either U or U, so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in <a href="/wiki/MOX_fuel" title="MOX fuel">mixed oxide (MOX) fuels</a> to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage is that it is difficult and dangerous to reprocess the used fuel because many of the daughters of Th and U are strong gamma emitters. Additionally, all U production methods other than mercury fluourescence always result in significant impurities of the very dangerous gamma emitter <a href="/wiki/Uranium-232" title="Uranium-232">U</a>, either from parasitic (n,2n) reactions on Th, Pa, or U that result in the loss of a neutron, or from double neutron capture of Th, an impurity in natural Th:</p>

<p>These impurities of U make U very easy to detect and very dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> using U as the fissile material. Additionally, Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27 days and a high <a href="/wiki/Cross_section_(physics)" title="Cross section (physics)">cross section</a> for neutron capture. Thus it is a <a href="/wiki/Neutron_poison" title="Neutron poison">neutron poison</a>: instead of rapidly decaying to the useful U, a significant amount of Pa converts to U and consumes neutrons, degrading <a href="/wiki/Neutron_economy" title="Neutron economy">the reactor efficiency</a>. To avoid this, Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">molten salt reactors</a> during their operation, so that it only decays to U.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of the thorium fuel cycle is the need to neutron-irradiate and process natural Th before these advantages become real, and this requires more advanced technology than the presently used fuels based on uranium and plutonium; nevertheless, advances are being made in this technology. Another common criticism centres around the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle: some entities like the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_Energy_Agency" title="Nuclear Energy Agency">Nuclear Energy Agency</a> go further and predict that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance—a situation which <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Findlay" title="Trevor Findlay">Trevor Findlay</a> predicts will persist "in the coming decades". Furthermore, though the isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are not transuranic, some of them are still very dangerous, such as Pa, which has a long half-life of 32760 years and is a major contributor to the long term <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radiotoxic" title="Radiotoxic">radiotoxicity</a> of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Toxicity">Toxicity</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Radiological">Radiological</span></h3>

<p>Thorium is odourless and tasteless. As thorium occurs naturally, it exists in very small quantities almost everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100 <a href="/wiki/Microgram" title="Microgram">micrograms</a> of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day of thorium. This exposure is raised for people who live near uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, thorium deposits, radioactive waste disposal sites, and for those who work in uranium, thorium, tin, or phosphate mining or gas mantle production industries. Thorium is especially common in the <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average. When thorium is ingested, 99.98% does not remain in the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the <a href="/wiki/Skeleton" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a>. While absorption through the skin is possible, it is not a likely means of thorium exposure.</p>
<p>Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alpha_radiation" title="Alpha radiation">alpha radiation</a> emitted cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, owning and handling small amounts of thorium, such as those in a gas mantle, is considered safe, although usage of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancers</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Lung" title="Lung">lung</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pancreas" title="Pancreas">pancreas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a>, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> diseases.</p>
<p>Because Th is only mildly radioactive, but decays to more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon, emitting alpha and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gamma_radiation" title="Gamma radiation">gamma radiation</a>, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of Th must include the contribution of its daughters such as Ra, which are dangerous gamma emitters. There are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles, as the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thoria (except of course Th, which is chemically identical to its parent Th), and they would be volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. For example, during burning, significant fractions of the thorium daughters Ra, Ra, Pb, and Bi are released in the first hour of use alone. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2 <a href="/wiki/Sievert" title="Sievert">millisieverts</a> per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mammogram" title="Mammogram">mammogram</a>. If a mantle is ingested, 0.4% of the thorium and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_safety" title="Nuclear safety">nuclear safety</a> agencies make recommendations about their use, and have raised some safety concerns regarding their <a href="/wiki/Gas_mantle#Safety_concerns" title="Gas mantle">manufacture</a> and disposal, because while the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem, that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical">Chemical</span></h3>
<p>The chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water. Nevertheless, some thorium compounds are chemically moderately <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a>. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of <a href="/wiki/Dermatitis" title="Dermatitis">dermatitis</a>. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.</p>
<p>Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and often ignites spontaneously in air. In the 1956 <a href="/wiki/Sylvania_Electric_Products_explosion" title="Sylvania Electric Products explosion">Sylvania Electric Products explosion</a>, the burning of thorium metal powder <a href="/wiki/Sludge" title="Sludge">sludge</a> led to nine injuries, some severe, as well as one death from thorium poisoning.</p>
