Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly, they can in general all be said to draw on a common "vocabulary" of decorative and constructive elements.

<p>The term "classical architecture" also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state, such as classical Chinese architecture, or classical Mayan architecture. It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h3>
<p>Classical architecture is derived from the architecture of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. With the <a href="/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustulus" title="Deposition of Romulus Augustulus">collapse of the western part of the Roman empire</a>, the architectural traditions of the Roman empire ceased to be practised in large parts of western Europe. In the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the ancient ways of building lived on but relatively soon developed into a distinct <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_architecture" title="Byzantine architecture">Byzantine style</a>. The first conscious efforts to bring back the disused language of form of classical antiquity into Western architecture can be traced to the <a href="/wiki/Carolingian_architecture" title="Carolingian architecture">Carolingian Renaissance</a> of the late 8th and 9th centuries. The gatehouse of <a href="/wiki/Lorsch_Abbey" title="Lorsch Abbey">Lorsch Abbey</a> (c. 800), in present-day <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> thus displays a system of alternating attached columns and arches which could be an almost direct paraphrase of e.g., that of the <a href="/wiki/Colosseum" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a> in Rome. <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_architecture" title="Byzantine architecture">Byzantine architecture</a>, just as <a href="/wiki/Romanesque_architecture" title="Romanesque architecture">Romanesque</a> and even to some extent <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic architecture</a> (with which classical architecture is often juxtaposed), can also incorporate classical elements and details but do not to the same degree reflect a conscious effort to draw upon the architectural traditions of antiquity; for example, they do not observe the idea of <a href="/wiki/Classical_order" title="Classical order">a systematic order of proportions for pillars</a>. In general, therefore, they are not considered classical architectural styles in a strict sense.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Development">Development</span></h3>

<p>During the Italian renaissance and with the demise of Gothic style, major efforts were made by architects such as <a href="/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti" title="Leon Battista Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sebastiano_Serlio" title="Sebastiano Serlio">Sebastiano Serlio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giacomo_Barozzi_da_Vignola" title="Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola">Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola</a> to revive the language of architecture of first and foremost ancient Rome. This was done in part through the study of the ancient Roman architectural treatise <i><a href="/wiki/De_architectura" title="De architectura">De architectura</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Vitruvius" title="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>, and to some extent by studying the actual remains of ancient Roman buildings in Italy. Nonetheless, the classical architecture of the Renaissance from the outset represents a highly specific interpretation of the classical ideas. In a building like the <i><a href="/wiki/Ospedale_degli_Innocenti" title="Ospedale degli Innocenti">Ospedale degli Innocenti</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> by <a href="/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi" title="Filippo Brunelleschi">Filippo Brunelleschi</a>, one of the very earliest Renaissance buildings (built 1419–45), the treatment of the columns for example has no direct antecedent in ancient Roman architecture. During this time period, the study of ancient architecture developed into the architectural theory of classical architecture; somewhat over-simplified, one could say that classical architecture in its variety of forms ever since have been interpretations and elaborations of the architectural rules set down during antiquity.</p>
<p>Most of the styles originating in post-<a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a> <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir <a href="/wiki/John_Summerson" title="John Summerson">John Summerson</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Classical_Language_of_Architecture" title="The Classical Language of Architecture">The Classical Language of Architecture</a></i>. The elements of classical architecture have been applied in radically different architectural contexts than those for which they were developed, however. For example, <a href="/wiki/Baroque_architecture" title="Baroque architecture">Baroque</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rococo_architecture#Architecture" title="Rococo architecture">Rococo architecture</a> are styles which, although classical at root, display an architectural language very much in their own right. During these periods, architectural theory still referred to classical ideas but rather less sincerely than during the Renaissance.</p>
<p>As a reaction to late baroque and rococo forms, architectural theorists from circa 1750 through what became known as <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture" title="Neoclassical architecture">Neoclassicism</a> again consciously and earnestly attempted to emulate antiquity, supported by recent developments in <a href="/wiki/Classical_archaeology" title="Classical archaeology">Classical archaeology</a> and a desire for an architecture based on clear rules and rationality. <a href="/wiki/Claude_Perrault" title="Claude Perrault">Claude Perrault</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marc-Antoine_Laugier" title="Marc-Antoine Laugier">Marc-Antoine Laugier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carlo_Lodoli" title="Carlo Lodoli">Carlo Lodoli</a> were among the first theorists of neoclassicism, while <a href="/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Louis_Boull%C3%A9e" title="Étienne-Louis Boullée">Étienne-Louis Boullée</a>, <a href="/wiki/Claude_Nicolas_Ledoux" title="Claude Nicolas Ledoux">Claude Nicolas Ledoux</a>, <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Gilly" title="Friedrich Gilly">Friedrich Gilly</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Soane" title="John Soane">John Soane</a> were among the more radical and influential. Neoclassical architecture held a particularly strong position on the architectural scene c. 1750–1850. The competing <a href="/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="Gothic Revival architecture">neo-Gothic style</a> however rose to popularity during the early 1800s, and the later part the 19th century was characterised by a variety of styles, some of them only slightly or not at all related to classicism (such as <a href="/wiki/Art_Nouveau" title="Art Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Eclecticism_in_architecture" title="Eclecticism in architecture">eclecticism</a>. Although classical architecture continued to play an important role and for periods of time at least locally dominated the architectural scene, as exemplified by the "<a href="/wiki/Nordic_Classicism" title="Nordic Classicism">Nordic Classicism</a>" during the 1920s, classical architecture in its stricter form never regained its former dominance. With the advent of <a href="/wiki/Modern_architecture" title="Modern architecture">Modernism</a> during the early 20th century, classical architecture arguably almost completely ceased to be practised.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scope">Scope</span></h2>
<p>As noted above, classical styles of architecture dominated Western architecture for a very long time, roughly from the Renaissance until the advent of <a href="/wiki/Modern_architecture" title="Modern architecture">Modernism</a>. That is to say, that classical antiquity at least in theory was considered the prime source of inspiration for architectural endeavours in the West for much of <a href="/wiki/Modern_history" title="Modern history">Modern history</a>. Even so, because of liberal, personal or theoretically diverse interpretations of the antique heritage, classicism covers a broad range of styles, some even so to speak cross-referencing, like <a href="/wiki/Palladian_architecture#Neo-Palladian" title="Palladian architecture">Neo-Palladian architecture</a>, which draws its inspiration from the works of Italian Renaissance architect <a href="/wiki/Andrea_Palladio" title="Andrea Palladio">Andrea Palladio</a> — who himself drew inspiration from ancient Roman architecture. Furthermore, it can even be argued (as noted above) that styles of architecture not typically considered classical, like Gothic, can be said to contain classical elements. Therefore, a simple delineation of the scope of classical architecture is difficult to make. The more or less defining characteristic can still be said to be a reference to ancient Greek or Roman architecture, and the architectural rules or theories that derived from that architecture.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Petrification">Petrification</span></h2>
<p>In the grammar of architecture, the word <i>petrification</i> is often used when discussing the development of sacred structures, such as temples, mainly with reference to developments in the Greek world. During the <a href="/wiki/Archaic_Greece" title="Archaic Greece">Archaic</a> and early <a href="/wiki/Classical_Greece" title="Classical Greece">Classical</a> periods (about the 6th and early 5th centuries BC), the architectural forms of the earliest temples had solidified and the <a href="/wiki/Doric_order" title="Doric order">Doric</a> emerged as the predominant element. A widely accepted theory in classical studies is that the earliest temple structures were of wood and the great forms, or elements of architectural style, were codified and rather permanent by the time we see the Archaic emergent and established. It was during this period, at different times and places in the Greek world, that the use of dressed and polished stone replaced the wood in these early temples, but the forms and shapes of the old wooden styles were retained, just as if the wooden structures had turned to stone, thus the designation <i>petrification</i> or sometimes "petrified carpentry" for this process.</p>
<p>This careful preservation of the primitive wooden appearance in the stone fabric of the newer buildings was scrupulously observed and this suggests that it may have been dictated by religion rather than aesthetics, although the exact reasons are now lost in the mists of antiquity. And not everyone within the great reach of Mediterranean civilization made this transition. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Etruscans" title="Etruscans">Etruscans</a> in Italy were, from their earliest period, greatly influenced by their contact with Greek culture and religion, but they retained their wooden temples (with some exceptions) until their culture was completely absorbed into the Roman world, with the great wooden <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temple_of_Jupiter_(Capitoline_Hill)" title="Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)">Temple of Jupiter</a> on the Capitol in Rome itself being a good example. Nor was it the lack of knowledge of stone working on their part that prevented them from making the transition from timber to dressed stone.</p>
