<p>The <b><i>Top Gear</i> test track</b> is used by the <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> automotive television programme <i><a href="/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)" title="Top Gear (2002 TV series)">Top Gear</a></i>. It is located at <a href="/wiki/Dunsfold_Aerodrome" title="Dunsfold Aerodrome">Dunsfold Aerodrome</a> in <a href="/wiki/Surrey" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>, United Kingdom. The track was designed by <a href="/wiki/Lotus_Cars" title="Lotus Cars">Lotus Cars</a> as a testing facility for the <a href="/wiki/Colin_Chapman" title="Colin Chapman">Colin Chapman</a>-run company, with many of its <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> cars tested there. It is used to test both cars and drivers seen on the programme, mainly in <i>Power Laps</i> and <i>Star in a Reasonably Priced Car</i>.</p>
<p>For the <a href="/wiki/Top_Gear_(series_23)" title="Top Gear (series 23)">23rd series</a> of <i>Top Gear</i> the track was expanded with a <a href="/wiki/Rallycross" title="Rallycross">rallycross</a> section for the new "Star in a Rallycross Car" segment.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Layout">Layout</span></h2>
<p>The track is on a former <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force" title="Royal Canadian Air Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> airbase constructed during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and later used by <a href="/wiki/British_Aerospace" title="British Aerospace">British Aerospace</a> as a manufacturing and test facility. The track's main route, marked by painted lines and simple structures such as stacks of tyres, was designed by test drivers from <a href="/wiki/Lotus_Cars" title="Lotus Cars">Lotus</a>. The layout of the track is designed to put the car through various conditions, ranging from provoking <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Understeer" title="Understeer">understeer</a> to testing brake balance and tyres. The track is approximately 1.75 miles (2.82 km) long. It is considered to be an equaliser for cars since, according to <a href="/wiki/Richard_Hammond" title="Richard Hammond">Richard Hammond</a>, both 0–60 miles per hour (0–96.6 km/h) times and top speed are totally meaningless. The track also incorporates a <a href="/wiki/Dragstrip" title="Dragstrip">drag strip</a>; although this is not used for timed segments, it does feature in some challenges and other features on the show.</p>
<p>The course starts on the perimeter road outside the <i>Top Gear</i> studio. The first bend is a fast right-left kink named "<a href="/wiki/Easy_listening" title="Easy listening">Crooner</a> Curves." "<a href="/wiki/Quentin_Willson" title="Quentin Willson">Willson</a> Bend" is the first proper turn on the track and the first corner usually seen when <a href="/wiki/The_Stig" title="The Stig">The Stig</a> is lapping a car. "<a href="/wiki/Chicago_(band)" title="Chicago (band)">Chicago</a>", a long right-hand around a tyre wall onto the main runway, was designed by Lotus as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_handling#Center_of_gravity_forward_or_back" title="Car handling">steady state corner</a>, designed to highlight understeer or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oversteer" title="Oversteer">oversteer</a> of the chassis. Next is "Hammerhead", a left-then-right corner, which again highlights understeer and oversteer. The track comes to a right-hand curve, then the course turns right through the flat-out section called the "Follow Through". After the left hand "Bentley Bend" named after the person who first "discovered" <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> and former <i>Top Gear</i> presenter, <a href="/wiki/Jon_Bentley_(TV_presenter)" title="Jon Bentley (TV presenter)">Jon Bentley</a>, but commonly referred to simply as "the tyres", the course comes to "<a href="/wiki/Burt_Bacharach" title="Burt Bacharach">Bacharach</a> Bend", which, after the first series, has been referred to as the "Penultimate Corner" or the "Second-to-last Corner" and is often regarded as one of the most challenging on the course. The final turn before the finish line is "Gambon" in honour of <a href="/wiki/Michael_Gambon" title="Michael Gambon">Sir Michael Gambon</a>, who completed the turn on two wheels in episode 8 of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Top_Gear_episodes#Series_1" title="List of Top Gear episodes">Series 1</a>. Prior to this, the corner was known as "<a href="/wiki/The_Carpenters" title="The Carpenters">Carpenters</a> Corner".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Usage">Usage</span></h2>
<p>The track is used routinely for the <i>Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car</i> and <i>Power Laps</i> segments on <i>Top Gear</i>. It also serves myriad roles in other portions of the programme, especially in testing cars and in challenges. When testing cars, they are often driven around the airfield by the presenters. Afterwards, they are taken around the test track by The Stig to set a lap time. Occasionally, drag races and speed tests are held on the runway.</p>
<p>Cars acquired during challenges must often post lap times (driven by either one of the presenters or The Stig) around the track against either a target time or a time set by The Stig in another vehicle. During many challenges, the track is used in more unorthodox fashions — for instance, serving as a makeshift motorway lane during a challenge testing tailgating prowess with vans.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Power_Laps">Power Laps</span></h2>

<p><b>Power Laps</b> is a segment of the programme in which The Stig completes a lap around the track in a reviewed car to compare its performance to previous contenders.</p>
<p>To be eligible to appear on the Power Lap Times board, a vehicle must be a road-legal production car and must have sufficient ride height to clear a standard <a href="/wiki/Speed_bump" title="Speed bump">speed bump</a> (referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman), although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed. Whenever a <a href="/wiki/Top_Gear_test_track#Lap_times_of_non-qualifying_vehicles" title="Top Gear test track">non-qualifying vehicle</a> is raced, the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board, for example - the <a href="/wiki/Ferrari_FXX" title="Ferrari FXX">Ferrari FXX</a> owned by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Schumacher" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> (1:10.7) was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used <a href="/wiki/Racing_slick" title="Racing slick">slick tyres</a>.</p>
<p>All laps are timed with the car's manufacturer-provided adjustable settings configured for maximum performance — all adjustable suspensions are set at their most efficient, all gear shift maps are at their most aggressive, and driving aids such as traction control are deactivated. Lap times do not offer complete comparisons between the cars, mainly because wet or otherwise poor weather conditions (see <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Top_Gear_Test_Track#Time_deductions" title="Top Gear Test Track">time deductions</a></i> below) can negatively affect lap times.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Power_Board">The Power Board</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/List_of_Top_Gear_test_track_Power_Lap_Times" title="List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times">List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times</a></div>

<p>Due to the size of the list, only the top 20 are shown. See <a href="/wiki/List_of_Top_Gear_test_track_Power_Lap_Times" title="List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times">List of <i>Top Gear</i> test track Power Lap Times</a> for the full list.</p>
<p>The second most powerful production car ever featured on <i>Top Gear</i>, the 1001 PS (987 bhp; 736 kW) <a href="/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron" title="Bugatti Veyron">Bugatti Veyron</a>, was taken around the track by The Stig in Series 12, Episode 4, after 3 years of waiting. However, it disappointed the team by only managing fifth place on the Power Board (currently 16th), an unexpectedly low position ultimately attributed to the car's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kerb_weight" title="Kerb weight">kerb weight</a> of 1,888 kg (4,162 lb), more than any of the four faster cars. In Series 15 Episode 5 however, the Stig took the 1,200 PS <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron_Super_Sport" title="Bugatti Veyron Super Sport">Super Sport</a> version around the track in 1:16.8, thus setting a new lap record.</p>
<p>For the 1:17.6 lap, the <a href="/wiki/Koenigsegg_CCX" title="Koenigsegg CCX">Koenigsegg CCX</a> (written as "Koeniggggsenisseggsegnignigsegigisegccx2 with the Top Gear wing" on a much-longer magnetic strip, because none of the presenters were able to spell Koenigsegg) was fitted with an optional rear spoiler to provide <a href="/wiki/Downforce" title="Downforce">downforce</a> after The Stig spun the unmodified version off the track. The Stig allegedly recommended this modification, correctly predicting that the car would then be the fastest ever round the track, although Koenigsegg stated that the improvement was due to other adjustments.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lap_times_of_non-qualifying_vehicles">Lap times of non-qualifying vehicles</span></h3>
<p>A "non-qualifying" vehicle is one that does not meet the presenters' requirements to remain on the board; that is, one that is not a "road car", which according to <i>Top Gear</i> means being: available to buy, fully road-legal (lights, indicators, registration, profile tyres, etc.), and street-worthy (i.e. able to negotiate a <a href="/wiki/Speed_bump" title="Speed bump">speed bump</a>).</p>

<p>The Caparo, Radical, and Westfield are road-legal in the UK but are unable to clear a speed bump. According to Caparo, the car driven by <i>Top Gear</i> was a prototype that didn't feature the adjustable ride height found on the production model. Because The Stig set his time in the non-adjustable prototype and the production version has not been driven around the track, the Caparo's time remains ineligible for the Power Lap board.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-Top_Gear_laps">Non-<i>Top Gear</i> laps</span></h3>
<p>Occasionally attempts at the Power Lap record are made without the support of the BBC. The following laps of Dunsfold were recorded, filmed and promoted independently of the <i>Top Gear</i> television programme.</p>

<p>Ultima claim that their motive for running a non-televised lap was that they felt that the GTR was being specifically ignored by the producers of <i>Top Gear</i>. Why Dunlop – Injection chose to run a lap of the Dunsfold circuit is not stated, although it is noticeable that the slower "official" Caterham run was limited by cold tyres.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Celebrity_laps">Celebrity laps</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Star_in_a_Reasonably_Priced_Car_.28series_1-22.29">Star in a Reasonably Priced Car (series 1-22)</span></h3>
<p><i>Star in a Reasonably Priced Car</i> was a recurring segment on <i>Top Gear</i>. During most programmes, a celebrity (usually, but not exclusively of British fame) is interviewed by Jeremy Clarkson. Discussion is normally amusing, and focuses on car-related matters, such as the celebrity's car history. Then Clarkson and the studio audience watch the guest's fastest lap on the <i>Top Gear</i> test track, after which Clarkson puts the celebrity's time on the time board.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Suzuki_Liana_.282002.E2.80.932005.29">Suzuki Liana (2002–2005)</span></h4>

<p>For the first seven series the car driven for lap times was a <a href="/wiki/Suzuki_Aerio" title="Suzuki Aerio">Suzuki Liana</a>. When first introduced, the car was worth £9995. The car used is stock except for a <a href="/wiki/Roll_cage" title="Roll cage">roll cage</a> and racing seats added as safety measures. Each guest practises with The Stig before making several attempts to complete the test track in the fastest time. The guest does not learn their time until the interview. Practice laps, crashes and the drivers' facial expressions are also shown during the segment.</p>
<p>The two slowest laps on the Liana celebrity list are held by <a href="/wiki/Terry_Wogan" title="Terry Wogan">Terry Wogan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Whiteley" title="Richard Whiteley">Richard Whiteley</a>, both of whom were beaten by <a href="/wiki/Billy_Baxter_(motorcyclist)" title="Billy Baxter (motorcyclist)">Billy Baxter</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="War in Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnian war</a> veteran who is completely blind. He guided the Liana through the track under direction from Clarkson in the passenger seat in a time of 2 minutes 2 seconds, which was 1.4 seconds quicker than Terry Wogan, and 4 seconds faster than Richard Whiteley.</p>
<p>The fastest non-professional driver was <a href="/wiki/Ellen_MacArthur" title="Ellen MacArthur">Ellen MacArthur</a>. Unlike most contenders she made no comments to the camera during her lap. She completed the lap in 1 minute 46.7 seconds, beating <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carr" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a> by 0.2 seconds. The current fastest professional driver in the Liana is <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo" title="Daniel Ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> with 1:42.2.</p>
<p>The Liana endured considerable abuse from the stars while undertaking their laps. In one incident, actor <a href="/wiki/Michael_Gambon" title="Michael Gambon">Michael Gambon</a> clipped the final corner, taking the car onto two wheels. It was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named "Gambon Corner". When <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Richie" title="Lionel Richie">Lionel Richie</a> drove the Liana, one of the front wheels fell off, invoking Clarkson to coin the term "pulling a Lionel". <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Eve" title="Trevor Eve">Trevor Eve</a> also lost a wheel. The former British transport minister <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Ladyman" title="Stephen Ladyman">Stephen Ladyman</a> added further injury to the Liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a tyre wall. <a href="/wiki/David_Soul" title="David Soul">David Soul</a> destroyed the gearbox of two Lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style. <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Kielty" title="Patrick Kielty">Patrick Kielty</a> broke the Liana's front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass. <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Eccleston" title="Christopher Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> was the only celebrity to use a Liana with an automatic transmission, because a hesitant Eccleston admitted he was "only qualified to drive an automatic." To accommodate his needs, <i>Top Gear</i> succeeded in borrowing an automatic Liana, of which only 40 existed in the UK. As a reference to his role in <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>, the automatic Liana was shown materialising onto the racing track, with a <a href="/wiki/TARDIS" title="TARDIS">TARDIS</a> materialisation sound effect played over it.</p>
<p>The Liana has also been modified on several occasions. David Soul's Liana featured a red police light and a white stripe in reference to his <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Starsky_and_Hutch" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a></i> role. <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Vegas" title="Johnny Vegas">Johnny Vegas</a> was provided with <a href="/wiki/L-plate" title="L-plate">L-plates</a> as he had not passed his driving test at the time. When <a href="/wiki/Justin_Hawkins" title="Justin Hawkins">Justin Hawkins</a> came on the show, the Liana he drove had flame decals pasted on it. Actor <a href="/wiki/Sanjeev_Bhaskar" title="Sanjeev Bhaskar">Sanjeev Bhaskar</a> had an ornate tissue box placed in the back, an homage to Indian drivers.</p>
<p>In its service, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; went through 400 tyres; its brakes were changed 100 times; and it required six new clutches, two new hubs, driveshafts, wishbones, struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror.</p>
<p>In July 2005, <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> driver <a href="/wiki/Damon_Hill" title="Damon Hill">Damon Hill</a> appeared on the show for the first time as the star. This was kept a surprise to the audience and the viewing public, and when <a href="/wiki/Nigel_Mansell" title="Nigel Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a> came on the show, it was covered up in magazines and on the internet by saying that the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car would be <a href="/wiki/Alan_Titchmarsh" title="Alan Titchmarsh">Alan Titchmarsh</a>. Since Mansell's appearance the Liana has remained in use as a vehicle reserved for Formula 1 drivers.</p>
<p>For some of the laps more than one person has been present in the car. This was the case for Clarkson's run when he had both Hammond and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jason_Dawe_(television)" title="Jason Dawe (television)">Jason Dawe</a> in the car. <a href="/wiki/Trinny_and_Susannah" title="Trinny and Susannah">Trinny and Susannah</a> were both in the car for each other's runs. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Denise_Van_Outen" title="Denise Van Outen">Denise Van Outen</a> was in the car when <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Vaughan" title="Johnny Vaughan">Johnny Vaughan</a> did his lap; Van Outen never did a lap driving the car. Clarkson was also present as a navigator for Billy Baxter's laps.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chevrolet_Lacetti_.282006.E2.80.932009.29">Chevrolet Lacetti (2006–2009)</span></h4>
<p>Starting with the eighth series the Liana was replaced by a <a href="/wiki/Daewoo_Lacetti" title="Daewoo Lacetti">Chevrolet Lacetti</a> and a new blank scoreboard. The format was changed so that each star would have five practice laps, and then a final timed lap, with no allowance being given for mishaps.</p>
<p>As a starter for the new car and format, an open day was held for any celebrity who wanted to take part. Seven stars recorded times that day: <a href="/wiki/James_Hewitt" title="James Hewitt">James Hewitt</a> (who Jeremy and Richard referred to as the 'Well Spoken Man' after failing to recognise him), comedians <a href="/wiki/Alan_Davies" title="Alan Davies">Alan Davies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carr" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a>, rock stars <a href="/wiki/Rick_Wakeman" title="Rick Wakeman">Rick Wakeman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Justin_Hawkins" title="Justin Hawkins">Justin Hawkins</a>, footballer <a href="/wiki/Les_Ferdinand" title="Les Ferdinand">Les Ferdinand</a>, and actor <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Eve" title="Trevor Eve">Trevor Eve</a> who topped the time at 1 minute 47.0 seconds. <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carr" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a>, who held second place in the Liana behind <a href="/wiki/Ellen_MacArthur" title="Ellen MacArthur">Ellen MacArthur</a>, spun off while doing his timed lap and got the second to one slowest time ever around the track at 2 minutes, 8.91 seconds.</p>
<p>On 28 January 2007, <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Oliver" title="Jamie Oliver">Jamie Oliver</a> posted a time of 1:47.70 in melted snow and standing water. Given the rivalry Oliver felt towards fellow celebrity chef, and then-lapboard leader, <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay" title="Gordon Ramsay">Gordon Ramsay</a>, Oliver asked that the 4-second allowance normally granted for wet laps be used to put him at the top of the leaderboard "just for a day".</p>
<p>Actress <a href="/wiki/Billie_Piper" title="Billie Piper">Billie Piper</a> posted a time of 1:48.3 but was deemed by The Stig to have failed to complete a lap properly, as she failed to negotiate some corners. The Stig suggested a three-second time penalty, but after Clarkson consulted the audience, it was decided to let the time stand, which her <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> co-star, <a href="/wiki/David_Tennant" title="David Tennant">David Tennant</a>, tried to overturn on 23 December 2007 show, at the end of the following series. Clarkson remarked that if Tennant had worn a see through top (like Piper for her interview), he "would have been faster than Simon Cowell".</p>
<p>In the 11 November 2007 episode, <a href="/wiki/Simon_Cowell" title="Simon Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> retook his status as the holder of the fastest lap with a time of 1:45.90. According to Clarkson, the cameramen said they had never seen such consistency in the practice laps. However, Cowell was knocked off the top spot in Series 11 by <a href="/wiki/Jay_Kay" title="Jay Kay">Jay Kay</a>, who now holds the fastest time in the Lacetti, although Clarkson selected the fastest of Jay Kay's times rather than the last run, which was slower than Cowell's time, seemingly due to a dislike of Cowell (he claimed earlier in the episode that Cowell had been at the top of the leaderboard for too long). Had this not happened, Cowell would have been knocked off the top by <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Designs" title="Grand Designs">Grand Designs</a></i> host <a href="/wiki/Kevin_McCloud" title="Kevin McCloud">Kevin McCloud</a>.</p>
<p>Clarkson has referred to the part of the board with times of 1:51 and over as the '<a href="/wiki/Actor" title="Actor">Thespian</a> Zone' due to the propensity for classically trained actors to post slow times.</p>
<p>Series 11 featured a slight change to the format, with two 'Stars' per episode instead of the previous one (although there had been a couple of editions in previous series' with more than one guest). Each of the pair are professionally associated with their fellow guest, usually both either act in or present the same TV show. Unlike previous episodes where two stars have appeared, the stars drove individual laps without the other present in the car.</p>
<p>On 28 March 2010, Richard Hammond attended the demolition of the two 550 ft chimneys at Lafarge Cement's Northfleet Works. On the first episode of Series 15, it was shown that the Lacetti was partially crushed by placing it in the path of one of the falling chimneys.</p>

<p>All <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> drivers are put into their own list with regard to lap times because of their exceptional skill level. When <a href="/wiki/Suzuki_Aerio" title="Suzuki Aerio">the Liana</a> was pulled out from retirement to allow <a href="/wiki/Jenson_Button" title="Jenson Button">Jenson Button</a> to make a time, Clarkson noted that the Liana would be pulled out for use by Formula 1 drivers in the future.</p>
<p>The original 'black' Stig and the first 'white' Stig have done laps around the track in the Suzuki Liana. Both had their times removed from the leaderboard upon their departure.</p>
<p>The first Stig was <a href="/wiki/Perry_McCarthy" title="Perry McCarthy">Perry McCarthy</a>, who once test drove for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WilliamsF1" title="WilliamsF1">Williams F1</a> team, and drove for the ill-fated <a href="/wiki/Andrea_Moda_Formula" title="Andrea Moda Formula">Andrea Moda Formula</a> One team. The second Stig was <a href="/wiki/Ben_Collins_(racing_driver)" title="Ben Collins (racing driver)">Ben Collins</a>; in the first episode of Series 13 the Stig was "revealed" to be Michael Schumacher, although this was a joke in the vein of the rest of his appearance on the show.</p>
<p>On 6 July 2011, <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel" title="Sebastian Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> managed to top the board with a time of 1:44.0. Vettel's lap was the first time someone taking a 'Formula One drivers' line through the first corner was able to top The Stig's time, as <a href="/wiki/Rubens_Barrichello" title="Rubens Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a> took the tighter line. Clarkson also mentioned on this episode that the current Stig has yet to do a lap of the track in the Liana, therefore there is currently no time on the board for the Stig.</p>
<p>On 17 February 2013, <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton" title="Lewis Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> returned to do a dry lap and lowered the F1 Drivers record by 1.1s to 1:42.9. This was in the wake of his move to Mercedes AMG for the 2013 season.</p>
<p>On 8 February 2015, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo" title="Daniel Ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> topped the board with a lap time of 1:42.2. Ricciardo took the tighter line through the first corner, claiming that it covered less distance.</p>

<p>Sometimes an additional term is written next to the time (such as H for hot). This indicates that The Stig and the <i>Top Gear</i> team consider that the prevalent weather conditions have affected the lap time or car's performance. The time on the board is not adapted: e.g. 1:50.0 MM (mildly moist) is deemed to be equivalent to 1:48.0 on a normal dry track, but is listed amongst the 1:50 times. The only lap ever done in the snow was that of Damian Lewis, whose time of 2:09.1 holds the record as the slowest ever completed lap; due to this, he was placed on a special separate "snow board". Lewis Hamilton on his first appearance had his lap listed as W+O (wet and oily) due to large slicks of <a href="/wiki/Motor_oil" title="Motor oil">oil</a> left on the track after an earlier car test.</p>
