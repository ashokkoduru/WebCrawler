<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p>A <b>common carrier</b> in <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> countries (corresponding to a <b>public carrier</b> in <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a> systems, usually called simply a <i><b>carrier</b></i>) is a person or company that transports goods or people for any person or company and that is responsible for any possible loss of the goods during transport. A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body. The regulatory body has usually been granted "ministerial authority" by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality, as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.</p>
<p>A common carrier is distinguished from a <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Contract_carrier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Contract carrier (page does not exist)">contract carrier</a> (also called a <i>public carrier</i> in UK English), which is a carrier that transports goods for only a certain number of clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a <a href="/wiki/Private_carrier" title="Private carrier">private carrier</a>. A common carrier holds itself out to provide service to the general <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_public" title="General public">public</a> without <a href="/wiki/Discrimination" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> (to meet the needs of the regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the "public convenience and necessity". A common carrier must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is "fit, willing, and able" to provide those services for which it is granted authority. Common carriers typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators.

Under US law, an ocean <a href="/wiki/Freight_forwarder" title="Freight forwarder">freight forwarder</a> cannot act as a common carrier.</p>
<p>The term <i>common carrier</i> is a common law term, seldom used in continental Europe because it has no exact equivalent in civil-law systems. In continental Europe, the functional equivalent of a common carrier is referred to as a <i>public carrier</i> (or simply as a <i>carrier</i>). (However, <i>public carrier</i> in continental Europe is different from <i>public carrier</i> in British English, where it is a synonym for <i>contract carrier</i>.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General">General</span></h2>
<p>Although common carriers generally transport people or <a href="/wiki/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a>, in the United States the term may also refer to <a href="/wiki/Telecommunications_service_provider" title="Telecommunications service provider">telecommunications service providers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Public_utility" title="Public utility">public utilities</a>. In certain <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">U.S. states</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amusement_park" title="Amusement park">amusement parks</a> that operate <a href="/wiki/Roller_coaster" title="Roller coaster">roller coasters</a> and comparable rides have been found to be common carriers; a famous example is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disneyland_Park_(Anaheim)" title="Disneyland Park (Anaheim)">Disneyland</a>.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies may also grant carriers the authority to operate under contract with their customers instead of under common carrier authority, rates, schedules and rules. These regulated carriers, known as contract carriers, must demonstrate that they are "fit, willing and able" to provide service, according to standards enforced by the regulator. However, contract carriers are specifically not required to demonstrate that they will operate for the "public convenience and necessity". A contract carrier may be authorized to provide service over either fixed routes and schedules, i.e., as regular route carrier or on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as an irregular route carrier.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the carrier refers only to the person (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Juristic_person" title="Juristic person">legal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Natural_person" title="Natural person">physical</a>) that enters into a contract of carriage with the shipper. The carrier does not necessarily have to own or even be in the possession of a means of transport. Unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract, the carrier may use whatever means of transport approved in its operating authority, as long as it is the most favorable from the <a href="/wiki/Cargo" title="Cargo">cargo</a> interests' point of view. The carriers' duty is to get the goods to the agreed destination within the agreed time or within reasonable time.</p>
<p>The person that is physically transporting the goods on a means of transport is referred to as the "actual carrier". When a carrier subcontracts with another provider, such as an <a href="/wiki/Independent_contractor" title="Independent contractor">independent contractor</a> or a third-party carrier, the common carrier is said to be providing "substituted service". The same person may hold both common carrier and contract carrier authority. In the case of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rail_line" title="Rail line">rail line</a> in the US, the owner of the property is said to retain a "residual common carrier obligation", unless otherwise transferred (such as in the case of a <a href="/wiki/Commuter_rail" title="Commuter rail">commuter rail</a> system, where the authority operating passenger trains may acquire the property but not this obligation from the former owner), and must operate the line if service is terminated.</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="/wiki/Private_carrier" title="Private carrier">private carriers</a> are not licensed to offer a service to the public. Private carriers generally provide transport on an irregular or <i>ad hoc</i> basis for their owners.</p>
<p>Carriers were very common in rural areas prior to motorised transport. Regular services by horse-drawn vehicles would ply to local towns, taking goods to market or bringing back purchases for the village. If space permitted, passengers could also travel.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Telecommunications">Telecommunications</span></h2>
<p>In the United States, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telecommunications" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a> carriers are regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> under title II of the <a href="/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934" title="Communications Act of 1934">Communications Act of 1934</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996" title="Telecommunications Act of 1996">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> made extensive revisions to the "Title II" provisions regarding common carriers and repealed the judicial 1982 AT&amp;T consent decree (often referred to as the "modification of final judgment" or "MFJ") that effectuated the breakup of AT&amp;T's Bell System. Further, the Act gives telephone companies the option of providing video programming on a common carrier basis or as a conventional cable television operator. If it chooses the former, the telephone company will face less regulation but will also have to comply with FCC regulations requiring what the Act refers to as "open video systems". The Act generally bars, with certain exceptions including most rural areas, acquisitions by telephone companies of more than a 10 percent interest in cable operators (and vice versa) and joint ventures between telephone companies and cable systems serving the same areas.</p>
<p>The FCC classified <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_Service_Providers" title="Internet Service Providers">Internet Service Providers</a> as common carriers, effective June 12, 2015, for the purpose of enforcing <a href="/wiki/Net_neutrality" title="Net neutrality">net neutrality</a>. Before that time, the Good Samaritan provision of the <a href="/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act" title="Communications Decency Act">Communications Decency Act</a> established immunity from liability for third party content on grounds of libel or slander, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DMCA" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> established that ISPs that comply with the DMCA would not be liable for the copyright violations of third parties on their network.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pipelines">Pipelines</span></h2>
<p>In the United States, many oil, gas and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a> <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipelines</a> are common carriers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates charged and other tariff terms imposed by interstate common carrier pipelines. Intrastate common carrier pipeline tariffs are often regulated by state agencies. The US and many states have delegated the power of <a href="/wiki/Eminent_domain" title="Eminent domain">eminent domain</a> to common carrier gas pipelines.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_implications">Legal implications</span></h2>
<p>Common carriers are subject to special laws and regulations that differ depending on the means of transport used, e.g. sea carriers are often governed by quite different rules from road carriers or railway carriers. In <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> jurisdictions as well as under international law, a common carrier is absolutely liable for goods carried by it, with four exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An act of nature</li>
<li>An act of the public enemies</li>
<li>Fault or fraud by the shipper</li>
<li>An inherent defect in the goods</li>
</ul>
<p>A sea carrier may also, according to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hague-Visby_Rules" title="Hague-Visby Rules">Hague-Visby Rules</a>, escape liability on other grounds than the above-mentioned, e.g. a sea carrier is not liable for damages to the goods if the damage is the result of a fire on board the ship or the result of a navigational error committed by the ship's master or other crewmember.</p>
<p>Carriers typically incorporate further exceptions into a <a href="/wiki/Contract_of_carriage" title="Contract of carriage">contract of carriage</a>, often specifically claiming not to be a common carrier.</p>
<p>An important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that it cannot <i>discriminate</i>, that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason. As of 2007, the status of Internet service providers as common carriers and their rights and responsibilities is widely debated (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Network_neutrality" title="Network neutrality">network neutrality</a>).</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that the term common carrier does not exist in continental Europe but is distinctive to common law systems, particularly law systems in the US.</p>
<p>In <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Ludditt_v_Ginger_Coote_Airways&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ludditt v Ginger Coote Airways (page does not exist)">Ludditt v Ginger Coote Airways</a></i> the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Privy_Council" title="Privy Council">Privy Council</a> (Lord Macmillan, Lord Wright, Lord Porter and Lord Simonds) held the liability of a public or common carrier of passengers is only to carry with due care. This is more limited than that of a common carrier of goods. The complete freedom of a carrier of passengers at common law to make such contracts as he thinks fit was not curtailed by the <a href="/wiki/Railway_and_Canal_Traffic_Act_1854" title="Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854">Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854</a>, and a specific contract that enlarges, diminishes or excludes his duty to take care (e.g., by a condition that the passenger travels "at his own risk against all casualties") cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable if the law authorises it. There was nothing in the provisions of the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Transport_Act_1938&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Canadian Transport Act 1938 (page does not exist)">Canadian Transport Act 1938</a> section 25 that would invalidate a provision excluding liability. <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Grand_Trunk_Railway_Co_of_Canada_v_Robinson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Grand Trunk Railway Co of Canada v Robinson (page does not exist)">Grand Trunk Railway Co of Canada v Robinson</a></i> [1915] A.C. 740 was followed and <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Peek_v_North_Staffordshire_Railway&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Peek v North Staffordshire Railway (page does not exist)">Peek v North Staffordshire Railway</a></i> 11 E.R. 1109 was distinguished.</p>
