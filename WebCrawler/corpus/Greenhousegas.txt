<p>A <b>greenhouse gas</b> (abbrev. <b>GHG</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gas</a> in an atmosphere that <a href="/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)" title="Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)">absorbs</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)" title="Emission (electromagnetic radiation)">emits</a> radiation within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_infrared" title="Thermal infrared">thermal infrared</a> range. This process is the fundamental cause of the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a>.

Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of <a href="/wiki/Earth#Surface" title="Earth">Earth's surface</a> would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).

<p>Human activities since the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> (taken as the year 1750) have produced a 40% increase in the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere">atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide</a>, from 280 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">ppm</a> in 1750 to 400 ppm in 2015.

<p>Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources (emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks (the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound). The proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the "<a href="/wiki/Airborne_fraction" title="Airborne fraction">airborne fraction</a>" (AF). More precisely, the annual airborne fraction is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year's total emissions. Over the last 50 years (1956–2006) the airborne fraction for CO<sub>2</sub> has been increasing at 0.25 ± 0.21%/year.</p>

Although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (CO) or <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride" title="Hydrogen chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> (HCl) absorb infrared radiation, these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility. Therefore, they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and usually are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Indirect_radiative_effects">Indirect radiative effects</span></h3>

<p>Some gases have indirect radiative effects (whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves). This happens in two main ways. One way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas. For example, methane and carbon monoxide (CO) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and methane oxidation also produces water vapor; that will be considered below). Oxidation of CO to CO<sub>2</sub> directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle. The peak of the thermal IR emission from Earth's surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of CO<sub>2</sub> (667 cm). On the other hand, the single CO vibrational band only absorbs IR at much higher frequencies (2145 cm), where the ~300 K thermal emission of the surface is at least a factor of ten lower. On the other hand, oxidation of methane to CO<sub>2</sub>, which requires reactions with the OH radical, produces an instantaneous reduction, since CO<sub>2</sub> is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane; but it has a longer lifetime. As described below this is not the whole story, since the oxidations of CO and <span class="chemf nowrap">CH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span> are intertwined by both consuming OH radicals. In any case, the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing.</p>
<p>A second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases. For example, the destruction of <a href="/wiki/Non-methane_volatile_organic_compound" title="Non-methane volatile organic compound">non-methane volatile organic compounds</a> (NMVOCs) in the atmosphere can produce ozone. The size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted.</p>
<p>Methane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming CO<sub>2</sub>. Firstly, the main chemical that destroys methane in the atmosphere is the <a href="/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical" title="Hydroxyl radical">hydroxyl radical</a> (OH). Methane reacts with OH and so more methane means that the concentration of OH goes down. Effectively, methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect. The second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone. Thirdly, as well as making CO<sub>2</sub> the oxidation of methane produces water; this is a major source of water vapor in the <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, which is otherwise very dry. CO and NMVOC also produce CO<sub>2</sub> when they are oxidized. They remove OH from the atmosphere and this leads to higher concentrations of methane. The surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of CO is three times that of CO<sub>2</sub>. The same process that converts NMVOC to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone. Halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone. Finally <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> can lead to ozone production and <span class="chemf nowrap">CH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span> increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Contribution_of_clouds_to_Earth.27s_greenhouse_effect">Contribution of clouds to Earth's greenhouse effect</span></h3>
<p>The major non-gas contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect, <a href="/wiki/Cloud_forcing" title="Cloud forcing">clouds</a>, also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases. Clouds are water droplets or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ice_crystal" title="Ice crystal">ice crystals</a> suspended in the atmosphere.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Impacts_on_the_overall_greenhouse_effect">Impacts on the overall greenhouse effect</span></h2>

<p>The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is affected by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 72 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation. Shindell <i>et al.</i> (2005) argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect.</p>
<p>When ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect, the most important are:</p>

<p>In addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases include <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride" title="Sulfur hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrofluorocarbon" title="Hydrofluorocarbon">hydrofluorocarbons</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Perfluorocarbon" title="Perfluorocarbon">perfluorocarbons</a> (see <a href="/wiki/IPCC_list_of_greenhouse_gases" title="IPCC list of greenhouse gases">IPCC list of greenhouse gases</a>). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For example, <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_trifluoride" title="Nitrogen trifluoride">nitrogen trifluoride</a> has a high <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">global warming potential</a> (GWP) but is only present in very small quantities.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Proportion_of_direct_effects_at_a_given_moment">Proportion of direct effects at a given moment</span></h3>
<p>It is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases. In addition, some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.</p>

<p>The atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mean_lifetime" title="Mean lifetime">mean lifetime</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">Carbon dioxide</a> has a variable atmospheric lifetime, and cannot be specified precisely. The atmospheric lifetime of CO<sub>2</sub> is estimated of the order of 30–95 years. This figure accounts for CO<sub>2</sub> molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean, photosynthesis, and other processes. However, this excludes the balancing fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs, which have slower characteristic rates. Although more than half of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction (about 20%) of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.   Similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases, many of which have longer mean lifetimes than CO<sub>2</sub>. E.g., <a href="#N2O">N<sub>2</sub>O</a> has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 114 years.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Radiative_forcing">Radiative forcing</span></h3>
<p>Earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun, reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as <a href="/wiki/Thermal_radiation" title="Thermal radiation">heat</a>. Earth's surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy. If this <a href="/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics" title="First law of thermodynamics">energy balance</a> is shifted, Earth's surface could become warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of changes in global climate.</p>
<p>A number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. As <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Atmospheric_lifetime" title="Greenhouse gas">explained above</a>, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's energy balance over a long time period. Factors that influence Earth's energy balance can be quantified in terms of "<a href="/wiki/Radiative_forcing" title="Radiative forcing">radiative climate forcing</a>." Positive radiative forcing indicates warming (for example, by increasing incoming energy or decreasing the amount of energy that escapes to space), whereas negative forcing is associated with cooling.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Global_warming_potential">Global warming potential</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">global warming potential</a> (GWP) depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured relative to the same <b>mass</b> of CO<sub>2</sub> and evaluated for a specific timescale. Thus, if a gas has a high (positive) <a href="/wiki/Radiative_forcing" title="Radiative forcing">radiative forcing</a> but also a short lifetime, it will have a large GWP on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale. Conversely, if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than CO<sub>2</sub> its GWP will increase with the timescale considered. Carbon dioxide is defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">Methane</a> has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 ± 3 years. The <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">2007 IPCC report</a> lists the GWP as 72 over a time scale of 20 years, 25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years. A 2014 analysis, however, states that although methane's initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of CO<sub>2</sub>, because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime, after six or seven decades, the impact of the two gases is about equal, and from then on methane's relative role continues to decline. The decrease in GWP at longer times is because <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#Removal_processes" title="Atmospheric methane">methane</a> is degraded to water and CO<sub>2</sub> through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Examples of the atmospheric lifetime and <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">GWP</a> relative to CO<sub>2</sub> for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table:</p>

<p>Aside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons, most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial <a href="/wiki/Holocene" title="Holocene">Holocene</a>, concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant. In the industrial era, human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.</p>
<p>The 2007 <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">Fourth Assessment Report</a> compiled by the IPCC (AR4) noted that "changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system", and concluded that "increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century". In AR4, "most of" is defined as more than 50%.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Ice_core" title="Ice core">Ice cores</a> provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over the past 800,000 years (see the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Ice_cores" title="Greenhouse gas">following section</a>). Both CO<sub>2</sub> and <span class="chemf nowrap">CH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span> vary between glacial and interglacial phases, and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature. Direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record, a record that indicates CO<sub>2</sub> <a href="/wiki/Mole_fraction" title="Mole fraction">mole fractions</a> stayed within a range of 180 ppm to 280 ppm throughout the last 800,000 years, until the increase of the last 250 years. However, various proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs; 500 million years ago CO<sub>2</sub> levels were likely 10 times higher than now. Indeed, higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the <a href="/wiki/Phanerozoic" title="Phanerozoic">Phanerozoic</a> eon, with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the Mesozoic era, and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early Palaeozoic era until the middle of the <a href="/wiki/Devonian" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> period, about 400 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Annum" title="Annum">Ma</a>. The spread of land plants is thought to have reduced CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations during the late Devonian, and plant activities as both sources and sinks of CO<sub>2</sub> have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks. Earlier still, a 200-million year period of intermittent, widespread glaciation extending close to the equator (<a href="/wiki/Snowball_Earth" title="Snowball Earth">Snowball Earth</a>) appears to have been ended suddenly, about 550 Ma, by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12%, about 350 times modern levels, causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a> at the rate of about 1 mm per day. This episode marked the close of the Precambrian eon, and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the Phanerozoic, during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved. No volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since. In the modern era, emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1% of emissions from human sources.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere#Past_variation" title="Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere">Measurements from Antarctic ice cores</a> show that before industrial emissions started atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> mole fractions were about 280 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">parts per million</a> (ppm), and stayed between 260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years. Carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s, rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009. One study using evidence from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stomata" title="Stomata">stomata</a> of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability, with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300 ppm during the period seven to ten thousand years ago, though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual CO<sub>2</sub> variability. Because of the way air is trapped in ice (pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn) and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed, these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_since_the_Industrial_Revolution">Changes since the Industrial Revolution</span></h3>


<p>Since the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, the concentrations of most of the greenhouse gases have increased. For example, the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280 ppm by about 36% to 380 ppm, or 100 ppm over modern pre-industrial levels. The first 50 ppm increase took place in about 200 years, from the start of the Industrial Revolution to around 1973.; however the next 50 ppm increase took place in about 33 years, from 1973 to 2006.</p>
<p>Recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate. In the 1960s, the average annual increase was only 37% of what it was in 2000 through 2007.</p>
<p>Today, the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than 3 million tonnes per annum (0.04%) compared with the existing stock. This increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels, deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions.</p>
<p>The other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases in both amount and rate of increase. Many observations are available online in a variety of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_Chemistry_Observational_Databases" title="Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases">Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases</a>.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Anthropogenic_greenhouse_gases">Anthropogenic greenhouse gases</span></h2>

<p>Since about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are currently 100 ppm higher than pre-industrial levels. Natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity, but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks, mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton. As a result of this balance, the atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era.</p>
<p>It is likely that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthropogenic" title="Anthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> (i.e., human-induced) warming, such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels, has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h4>
<p>According to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNEP" title="UNEP">UNEP</a> global <a href="/wiki/Tourism" title="Tourism">tourism</a> is closely linked to <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. Tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Tourism accounts for about 50% of traffic movements. Rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5% of the production of CO<sub>2</sub>. The number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020, adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Road_Haulage">Road Haulage</span></h4>
<p>The road haulage industry plays a part in production of CO<sub>2</sub>, contributing around 20% of the UK's total carbon emissions a year, with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%. Average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling—in the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007, the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent; NOx emissions are also down 87 percent, whereas journey times have fallen by around a third. Due to their size, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heavy_goods_vehicle" title="Heavy goods vehicle">HGVs</a> often receive criticism regarding their CO2 emissions; however, rapid development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely positive effect.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Role_of_water_vapor">Role of water vapor</span></h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/Water_vapor" title="Water vapor">Water vapor</a> accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect, between 36% and 66% for clear sky conditions and between 66% and 85% when including clouds. Water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally, but human activity does not significantly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales, such as near irrigated fields. The atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature, from less than 0.01% in extremely cold regions up to 3% by mass in saturated air at about 32 °C. (See <a href="/wiki/Relative_humidity#other_important_facts" title="Relative humidity">Relative humidity#other important facts</a>.)</p>
<p>The average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days, compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as <span class="chemf nowrap">CH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases. The <a href="/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation" title="Clausius–Clapeyron relation">Clausius–Clapeyron relation</a> establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures. This and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor (assuming that the <a href="/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a> remains approximately constant; modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so). Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this results in further warming and so is a "<a href="/wiki/Positive_feedback" title="Positive feedback">positive feedback</a>" that amplifies the original warming. Eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks, stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of Earth's water through a Venus-like <a href="/wiki/Runaway_greenhouse_effect" title="Runaway greenhouse effect">runaway greenhouse effect</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Direct_greenhouse_gas_emissions">Direct greenhouse gas emissions</span></h2>
<p>Between the period 1970 to 2004, GHG emissions (measured in <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent</a>) increased at an average rate of 1.6% per year, with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9% per year. Total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5 <a href="/wiki/Giga-" title="Giga-">gigatonnes</a> CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent. These emissions include CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuel use and from land use, as well as emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and other GHGs covered by the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol_and_government_action" title="Kyoto Protocol and government action">Kyoto Protocol and government action</a></div>

<p>There are several different ways of measuring GHG emissions, for example, see World Bank (2010) for tables of national emissions data. Some variables that have been reported include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of measurement boundaries: Emissions can be attributed geographically, to the area where they were emitted (the territory principle) or by the activity principle to the territory produced the emissions. These two principles result in different totals when measuring, for example, electricity importation from one country to another, or emissions at an international airport.</li>
<li>Time horizon of different GHGs: Contribution of a given GHG is reported as a CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent. The calculation to determine this takes into account how long that gas remains in the atmosphere. This is not always known accurately and calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information.</li>
<li>What sectors are included in the calculation (e.g., energy industries, industrial processes, agriculture etc.): There is often a conflict between transparency and availability of data.</li>
<li>The measurement protocol itself: This may be via direct measurement or estimation. The four main methods are the emission factor-based method, mass balance method, predictive emissions monitoring systems, and continuous emissions monitoring systems. These methods differ in accuracy, cost, and usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>These different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert various policy/ethical positions on climate change (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, p. 94). This use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability, which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets. There are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool, or at least the development of communication between different tools.</p>
<p>Emissions may be measured over long time periods. This measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions. Cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs (IEA, 2007, p. 199).</p>
<p>The national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions. The national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).</p>
<p>Emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods. Emissions changes may, for example, be measured against a base year of 1990. 1990 was used in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) as the base year for emissions, and is also used in the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> (some gases are also measured from the year 1995). A country's emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year.</p>
<p>Another measurement is of per capita emissions. This divides a country's total annual emissions by its mid-year population. Per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 106–107).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Land-use_change">Land-use change</span></h3>

<p>Land-use change, e.g., the clearing of forests for agricultural use, can affect the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sink" title="Carbon sink">carbon sinks</a>. Accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure "net" emissions, i.e., gross emissions from all GHG sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 92–93).</p>
<p>There are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions. Additionally, there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, p. 93). For instance, concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier, e.g., Europe.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Greenhouse_gas_intensity">Greenhouse gas intensity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_intensity" title="List of countries by carbon intensity">List of countries by carbon intensity</a></div>

<p>Greenhouse gas intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and another metric, e.g., gross domestic product (GDP) or energy use. The terms "carbon intensity" and "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_intensity" title="Emissions intensity">emissions intensity</a>" are also sometimes used. GHG intensities may be calculated using <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Cross-border_comparison" title="Gross domestic product">market exchange rates</a> (MER) or <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a> (PPP) (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, p. 96). Calculations based on MER show large differences in intensities between developed and developing countries, whereas calculations based on PPP show smaller differences.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cumulative_and_historical_emissions">Cumulative and historical emissions</span></h3>

<p>Cumulative anthropogenic (i.e., human-emitted) emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuel use are a major cause of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change.</p>

<p>The table above to the left is based on Banuri <i>et al.</i> (1996, p. 94). Overall, developed countries accounted for 83.8% of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over this time period, and 67.8% of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Developing countries accounted for industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 16.2% over this time period, and 32.2% of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The estimate of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions includes <a href="/wiki/Biota_(ecology)" title="Biota (ecology)">biotic</a> carbon emissions, mainly from deforestation. Banuri <i>et al.</i> (1996, p. 94) calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then-current population. The ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than 10 to 1.</p>
<p>Including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land-use change (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 93–94). The actual calculation of net emissions is very complex, and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system.</p>
<p>Non-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> countries accounted for 42% of cumulative energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between 1890 and 2007. Over this time period, the US accounted for 28% of emissions; the EU, 23%; Russia, 11%; China, 9%; other OECD countries, 5%; Japan, 4%; India, 3%; and the rest of the world, 18%.</p>

<p>Between 1970 and 2004, global growth in annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was driven by North America, Asia, and the Middle East. The sharp acceleration in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2 ppm per year) from 1.1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_intensity" title="Carbon intensity">carbon intensity</a> of both developing and developed nations. China was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period. Localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">efficient energy use</a>, made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported. In comparison, methane has not increased appreciably, and <span class="chemf nowrap">N<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

<p>Using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming. This can be calculated by dividing a country's highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year, by that country's minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year. Choosing between different base years of 1750, 1900, 1950, and 1990 has a significant effect for most countries. Within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/G8" title="G8">G8</a> group of countries, it is most significant for the UK, France and Germany. These countries have a long history of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (see the section on <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Cumulative_and_historical_emissions" title="Greenhouse gas">Cumulative and historical emissions</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Annual_emissions">Annual emissions</span></h3>

<p>Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries. Due to China's fast economic development, its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol#2012_emission_targets_and_.22flexible_mechanisms.22" title="Kyoto Protocol">Annex I group</a> of the Kyoto Protocol (i.e., the developed countries excluding the USA). Other countries with fast growing emissions are <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, Iran, and Australia (which apart from the oil rich Persian Gulf states, now has the highest percapita emission rate in the world). On the other hand, annual per capita emissions of the EU-15 and the USA are gradually decreasing over time. Emissions in Russia and <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries.</p>
<p>Energy statistics for fast growing economies are less accurate than those for the industrialized countries. For China's annual emissions in 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_Environmental_Assessment_Agency" title="Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency">Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency</a> estimated an uncertainty range of about 10%.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/GHG_footprint" title="GHG footprint">GHG footprint</a>, or greenhouse gas footprint, refers to the amount of GHG that are emitted during the creation of products or services.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Embedded_emissions">Embedded emissions</span></h3>
<p>One way of attributing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to measure the <a href="/wiki/Embedded_emissions" title="Embedded emissions">embedded emissions</a> (also referred to as "embodied emissions") of goods that are being consumed. Emissions are usually measured according to production, rather than consumption. For example, in the main international <a href="/wiki/Treaty" title="Treaty">treaty</a> on climate change (the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFCCC" title="UNFCCC">UNFCCC</a>), countries report on emissions produced within their borders, e.g., the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. Under a production-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country. Under a consumption-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country, rather than the exporting, country.</p>
<p>Davis and Caldeira (2010) found that a substantial proportion of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are traded internationally. The net effect of trade was to export emissions from China and other emerging markets to consumers in the US, Japan, and Western Europe. Based on annual emissions data from the year 2004, and on a per-capita consumption basis, the top-5 emitting countries were found to be (in tCO<sub>2</sub> per person, per year): Luxembourg (34.7), the US (22.0), Singapore (20.2), Australia (16.7), and Canada (16.6). Carbon Trust research revealed that approximately 25% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from human activities 'flow' (i.e. are imported or exported) from one country to another. Major developed economies were found to be typically net importers of embodied carbon emissions — with UK consumption emissions 34% higher than production emissions, and Germany (29%), Japan (19%) and the USA (13%) also significant net importers of embodied emissions.</p>

<p>Countries and regions listed in Annex I of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) (i.e., the OECD and former planned economies of the Soviet Union) are required to submit periodic assessments to the UNFCCC of actions they are taking to address climate change. Analysis by the UNFCCC (2011) suggested that policies and measures undertaken by Annex I Parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5 thousand <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)" title="Orders of magnitude (mass)">Tg</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">CO<sub>2</sub>-eq</a> in the year 2010, with most savings made in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_sector" title="Energy sector">energy sector</a>. The projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand Tg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq is measured against a hypothetical "<a href="/wiki/Economics_of_climate_change_mitigation#Baselines" title="Economics of climate change mitigation">baseline</a>" of Annex I emissions, i.e., projected Annex I emissions in the absence of policies and measures.

<p>A wide range of projections of future GHG emissions have been produced. Rogner <i>et al.</i> (2007) assessed the scientific literature on GHG projections. Rogner <i>et al.</i> (2007) concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially, the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 2025–2030. Projections suggest that more than 80% of the world's energy will come from fossil fuels. This conclusion was based on "much evidence" and "high agreement" in the literature. Projected annual energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2030 were 40–110% higher than in 2000, with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing countries. Projected annual per capita emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower (2.8–5.1 <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> CO<sub>2</sub>) than those in developed country regions (9.6–15.1 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>). Projections consistently showed increase in annual world GHG emissions (the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">"Kyoto"</a> gases, measured in <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent</a>) of 25–90% by 2030, compared to 2000.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes, as a consequence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a physical change (condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere).</li>
<li>a chemical reaction within the atmosphere. For example, methane is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidized" title="Oxidized">oxidized</a> by reaction with naturally occurring <a href="/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical" title="Hydroxyl radical">hydroxyl radical</a>, OH<b>·</b> and degraded to CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor (CO<sub>2</sub> from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">Global warming potential</a>). Other chemical reactions include solution and solid phase chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols.</li>
<li>a physical exchange between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet. An example is the mixing of atmospheric gases into the oceans.</li>
<li>a chemical change at the interface between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet. This is the case for CO<sub>2</sub>, which is reduced by <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> of plants, and which, after dissolving in the oceans, reacts to form <a href="/wiki/Carbonic_acid" title="Carbonic acid">carbonic acid</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bicarbonate" title="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbonate" title="Carbonate">carbonate</a> ions (see <a href="/wiki/Ocean_acidification" title="Ocean acidification">ocean acidification</a>).</li>

<p>A number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere. Most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as <a href="/wiki/Bio-energy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage">bio-energy with carbon capture and storage</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_air_capture" title="Carbon dioxide air capture">carbon dioxide air capture</a>, or to the soil as in the case with <a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">biochar</a>.

In the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made Earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without them. During the late 20th century, a <a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific consensus</a> evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system, with <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">consequences</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Physical_impacts_of_climate_change" title="Physical impacts of climate change">environment</a> and for <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming_on_human_health" title="Effects of global warming on human health">human health</a>.</p>
