Environmental green-collar workers (or <a href="/wiki/Green_job" title="Green job">green jobs</a>) satisfy the demand for <a href="/wiki/Green_development" title="Green development">green development</a>. Generally, they implement environmentally conscious design, policy, and technology to improve <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conservation_ethic" title="Conservation ethic">conservation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a>. Formal environmental regulations as well as informal social expectations are pushing many firms to seek professionals with expertise with environmental, <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a>, and clean <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> issues. They often seek to make their output more sustainable, and thus more favorable to public opinion, governmental regulation, and the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a>.</p>
<p>Green collar workers include professionals such as <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" title="Conservation movement">conservation movement</a> workers, environmental consultants, council environmental services/waste management/recycling managers/officers, environmental or biological systems engineers, <a href="/wiki/Green_building" title="Green building">green building</a> <a href="/wiki/Architect" title="Architect">architects</a>, landscape architects, holistic <a href="/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design" title="Passive solar building design">passive solar building designers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind energy</a> engineers and installers, nuclear engineers, <a href="/wiki/Green_vehicle" title="Green vehicle">green vehicle</a> engineers, "green business" owners, <a href="/wiki/Green_vehicle" title="Green vehicle">green vehicle</a>, organic farmers, environmental lawyers, ecology educators, and <a href="/wiki/Ecotechnology" title="Ecotechnology">ecotechnology</a> workers, and sales staff working with these services or products. Green collar workers also include vocational or trade-level workers: <a href="/wiki/Electrician" title="Electrician">electricians</a> who install <a href="/wiki/Solar_panel" title="Solar panel">solar panels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plumber" title="Plumber">plumbers</a> who install solar water heaters, recycling centre/MRF attendants, process managers and collectors, construction workers who build energy-efficient <a href="/wiki/Green_building" title="Green building">green buildings</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> farms, construction workers who weatherize buildings to make them more energy efficient, or other workers involved in clean, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable" title="Renewable">renewable</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable" title="Sustainable">sustainable</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Future_energy_development" title="Future energy development">future energy development</a>.</p>
<p>There is a growing movement to incorporate social responsibility within the green industries. A sustainable green economy simultaneously values the importance of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_resources" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a> and inclusive, equitable, and healthy opportunities for all communities.</p>
<p>In the context of the current world economic crisis, many experts now argue that a massive push to develop renewable sources of energy could create millions of new jobs and help the economy recover while simultaneously improving the environment, increasing labour conditions in poor economies, and strengthening energy and food security.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> states that economists across the spectrum — including <a href="/wiki/Martin_Feldstein" title="Martin Feldstein">Martin Feldstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Summers" title="Lawrence Summers">Lawrence Summers</a> — agree that large and rapid investments in a jobs-intensive infrastructure initiative is the best way to revive the economy in a quick and sustainable way.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Center_for_American_Progress">Center for American Progress</span></h2>
<p>A report from the Center for American Progress concludes that a $100 billion federal investment in clean energy technologies over 2009 and 2010 would yield 2 million new U.S. jobs, cutting the unemployment rate by 1.3% and put the nation on a path toward a low-carbon economy. The report, prepared by the <a href="/wiki/Political_Economy_Research_Institute" title="Political Economy Research Institute">Political Economy Research Institute</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, proposes $50 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency retrofits and renewable energy systems; $46 billion in direct government spending for public building retrofits, mass transit, freight rail, smart electrical grid systems, and renewable energy systems; and $4 billion for federal loan guarantees to help finance building retrofits and renewable energy projects. The Center believes that clean energy investments would yield about 300,000 more jobs than if the same funds were distributed among U.S. taxpayers. The clean energy investments would also have the added benefits of lower home energy bills and reduced prices for non-renewable energy sources, due to the reduced consumption of those energy sources.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Worldwatch_Institute.2F_UNEP">Worldwatch Institute/ UNEP</span></h2>
<p>Global efforts to tackle climate change could result in millions of "green" jobs over the coming decades, according to a 2008 study prepared by the <a href="/wiki/Worldwatch_Institute" title="Worldwatch Institute">Worldwatch Institute</a> with funding from the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP). The study found that the global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from $1.37 trillion per year at present to $2.74 trillion by 2020, with half of that market in <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">efficient energy use</a>. In terms of energy supply, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_industry" title="Renewable energy industry">renewable energy industry</a> will be particularly important. Some 2.3 million people have found <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> jobs in recent years, and projected investments of $630 billion by 2030 would translate into at least 20 million additional jobs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="U.S._Conference_of_Mayors">U.S. Conference of Mayors</span></h2>
<p>Also in 2008, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released a report that finds the U.S. economy currently generates more than 750,000 green jobs, while over the next 30 years, an emphasis on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clean_energy" title="Clean energy">clean energy</a> could result in a five-fold increase, to more than 4.2 million jobs. Engineering, legal, research, and consulting jobs currently dominate the green jobs in the United States and could grow by 1.4 million by 2038, while renewable electricity production will create 1.23 million jobs, alternative transportation fuels will add 1.5 million jobs, and building retrofits will create another 81,000 jobs. The report notes that most of today's jobs are in metropolitan areas, led by New York City; Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>The Swedish utility <a href="/wiki/Vattenfall" title="Vattenfall">Vattenfall</a> did a study of full life cycle emissions of Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind which the utility uses to produce electricity. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per KW-Hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> and 700 for <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO<sub>2</sub> of any of their electricity sources.</p>
<p>Claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste. A 2004 article from the BBC states: "The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) says 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions, and 1.6 million indoors through using solid fuel." In the U.S. alone, fossil fuel waste kills 20,000 people each year. A coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island" title="Three Mile Island">Three Mile Island</a> incident. In addition, fossil fuel waste causes <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes, flooding, and other weather events. The <a href="/wiki/World_Nuclear_Association" title="World Nuclear Association">World Nuclear Association</a> provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production. In their comparison, deaths per TW-yr of electricity produced from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear.</p>
