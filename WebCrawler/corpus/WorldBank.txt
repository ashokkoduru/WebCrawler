<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>The World Bank was created at the 1944 <a href="/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference" title="Bretton Woods Conference">Bretton Woods Conference</a>, along with three other institutions, including the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF). The president of the World Bank is, traditionally, an American. The World Bank and the IMF are both based in Washington, D.C., and work closely with each other.</p>

<p>Although many countries were represented at the Bretton Woods Conference, the United States and United Kingdom were the most powerful in attendance and dominated the negotiations.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1944.E2.80.931974"><span id="EarlyHistory"></span><span id="1944"></span><span id="1974"></span><span id="1944-1974"></span> 1944–1974</span></h3>
<p>Before 1974 the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism" title="Fiscal conservatism">Fiscal conservatism</a> ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.</p>
<p>The first country to receive a World Bank loan was France. The Bank's president at the time, <a href="/wiki/John_J._McCloy" title="John J. McCloy">John McCloy</a>, chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250 million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_State_Department" title="United States State Department">United States State Department</a> told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied with this <a href="/wiki/Diktat" title="Diktat">diktat</a> and removed the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_France" title="Communist Party of France">Communist</a> <a href="/wiki/Coalition_government" title="Coalition government">coalition government</a>. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.</p>
<p>When the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Plan" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earmark_(finance)" title="Earmark (finance)">earmarked</a> for the construction of income-producing infrastructure, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the <a href="/wiki/International_Development_Association" title="International Development Association">International Development Association</a> was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1974.E2.80.931980">1974–1980</span></h3>
<p>From 1974 to 1980 the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people in the developing world. The size and number of loans to borrowers was greatly increased as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors.</p>
<p>These changes can be attributed to <a href="/wiki/Robert_McNamara" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>, who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>. McNamara implored bank treasurer <a href="/wiki/Eugene_Rotberg" title="Eugene Rotberg">Eugene Rotberg</a> to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of funding. Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank. One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries%27_debt" title="Developing countries' debt">third world debt</a>. From 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20%.</p>
<p>In 1980 the World Bank Administrative Tribunal was established to decide on disputes between the World Bank Group and its staff where allegation of non-observance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been honored.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1980.E2.80.931989">1980–1989</span></h3>
<p>In 1980 McNamara was succeeded by US President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>'s nominee, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A._W._Clausen" title="A. W. Clausen">A. W. Clausen</a>. Clausen replaced many members of McNamara's staff and instituted a new ideological focus. His 1982 decision to replace the bank's Chief Economist, <a href="/wiki/Hollis_B._Chenery" title="Hollis B. Chenery">Hollis B. Chenery</a>, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anne_Krueger" title="Anne Krueger">Anne Krueger</a> was an indication of this new focus. Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> governments as "<a href="/wiki/Rent-seeking" title="Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a> states."</p>
<p>During the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and <a href="/wiki/Structural_adjustment" title="Structural adjustment">structural adjustment</a> policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations. <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for "reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in Asia, Latin America, and Africa".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1989.E2.80.93present">1989–present</span></h3>
<p>Beginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism. It also formed an implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop ozone-depletion damage to the Earth's atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals, with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called "Six Strategic Themes", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.</p>
<p>In order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces. In 2000 the bank announced a "war on AIDS" and in 2011 the Bank joined the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.</p>
<p>Less recently, a project in Seychelles to promote local tourism by the name of project MAGIC was launched in 2010. Its successor project TIME was scheduled to be launched in 2012.</p>
<p>Traditionally, based on a tacit understanding between the United States and Europe, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Bank_presidential_election,_2012" title="World Bank presidential election, 2012">president of the World Bank</a> has always been selected from candidates nominated by the United States. In 2012, for the first time, two non-US citizens were nominated.</p>
<p>On 23 March 2012, U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> announced that the United States would nominate <a href="/wiki/Jim_Yong_Kim" title="Jim Yong Kim">Jim Yong Kim</a> as the next president of the Bank. Jim Yong Kim was elected on 27 April 2012.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Criteria">Criteria</span></h4>
<p>Various developments have brought the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> targets for 2015 within reach in some cases. For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health and education, integration of the development and environment agendas, more as well as better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger</b>: From 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth. Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.</li>
<li><b>Achieve Universal Primary Education</b>: The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72 million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated as of 2005.</li>
<li><b>Promote Gender Equality</b>: The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men- worldwide more than 60% – are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.</li>
<li><b>Reduce Child Mortality</b>: There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.</li>
<li><b>Improve Maternal Health</b>: Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.</li>
<li><b>Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases</b>: Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6 million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500 million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1 million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
<li><b>Ensure Environmental Sustainability</b>: Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.</li>
<li><b>Develop a Global Partnership for Development</b>: Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal safeguards were defined. However, these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Poverty_reduction_strategies">Poverty reduction strategies</span></h2>
<p>For the poorest <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a> in the world, the bank's assistance plans are based on <a href="/wiki/Poverty_Reduction_Strategy_Paper" title="Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper">poverty reduction strategies</a>; by combining a cross-section of local groups with an extensive analysis of the country's financial and economic situation the World Bank develops a strategy pertaining uniquely to the country in question. The government then identifies the country's priorities and targets for the reduction of poverty, and the World Bank aligns its aid efforts correspondingly.</p>
<p>Forty-five countries pledged US$25.1 billion in "aid for the world's poorest countries", aid that goes to the World Bank <a href="/wiki/International_Development_Association" title="International Development Association">International Development Association</a> (IDA), which distributes the loans to eighty poorer countries. While wealthier nations sometimes fund their own aid projects, including those for diseases, and although IDA is the recipient of criticism, Robert B.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="World_Bank_Institute">World Bank Institute</span></h3>
<p>The World Bank Institute (WBI) creates learning opportunities for countries, World Bank staff and clients, and people committed to poverty reduction and sustainable development. WBI's work program includes training, policy consultations, and the creation and support of knowledge networks related to international economic and social development.</p>
<p>The World Bank Institute (WBI) can be defined as a "global connector of knowledge, learning and innovation for poverty reduction". It aims to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. WBI has four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute(WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. Currently Sanjay Pradhan is the Vice President of the World Bank Institute.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Global_Development_Learning_Network">Global Development Learning Network</span></h3>
<p>The Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is a partnership of over 120 learning centers (GDLN Affiliates) in nearly 80 countries around the world. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.</p>
<p>GDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="GDLN_Asia_Pacific">GDLN Asia Pacific</span></h4>
<p>The GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<p>GDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become "the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.</p>
<p>The committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>The Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a "Foundation". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.</p>
<p>GDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand – Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.</p>

<p>Based on an agreement between the United Nations and the World Bank in 1981, <i><a href="/wiki/Development_Business" title="Development Business">Development Business</a></i> became the official source for World Bank Procurement Notices, Contract Awards, and Project Approvals.</p>
<p>In 1998, the agreement was re-negotiated, and included in this agreement was a joint venture to create an electronic version of the publication via the World Wide Web. Today, <i>Development Business</i> is the primary publication for all major multilateral development banks, United Nations agencies, and several national governments, many of whom have made the publication of their tenders and contracts in <i>Development Business</i> a mandatory requirement.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticisms">Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>The World Bank has long been criticized by non-governmental organizations, such as the indigenous rights group <a href="/wiki/Survival_International" title="Survival International">Survival International</a>, and academics, including its former Chief Economist <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz" title="Joseph Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Hazlitt" title="Henry Hazlitt">Henry Hazlitt</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ludwig_Von_Mises" title="Ludwig Von Mises">Ludwig Von Mises</a>. Henry Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system it was designed within would promote world inflation and "a world in which international trade is State-dominated" when they were being advocated. Stiglitz argued that the so-called <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> reform policies that the Bank advocates are often harmful to <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a> if implemented badly, too quickly ("<a href="/wiki/Shock_therapy_(economics)" title="Shock therapy (economics)">shock therapy</a>"), in the wrong sequence or in weak, uncompetitive economies.</p>
<p>One of the strongest criticisms of the World Bank has been the way in which it is governed. While the World Bank represents 188 countries, it is run by a small number of economically powerful countries. These countries (which also provide most of the institution's funding) choose the leadership and senior management of the World Bank, and so their interests dominate the bank. Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the World Bank's role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank under apartheid, and therefore a pillar of <a href="/wiki/Global_apartheid" title="Global apartheid">global apartheid</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the World Bank and the IMF forged the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Consensus" title="Washington Consensus">Washington Consensus</a>, policies that included <a href="/wiki/Deregulation" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> and liberalization of markets, <a href="/wiki/Privatization" title="Privatization">privatization</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Civil_service_reform_in_developing_countries" title="Civil service reform in developing countries">downscaling of government</a>. Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out. Joseph Stiglitz argued that the Washington Consensus placed too much emphasis on the growth of GDP, and not enough on the permanence of growth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations" title="United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations">United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations</a> report criticized the World Bank and other international financial institutions for focusing too much "on issuing loans rather than on achieving concrete development results within a finite period of time" and called on the institution to "strengthen anti-corruption efforts".</p>
<p>Criticism of the World Bank often takes the form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protesting" title="Protesting">protesting</a> as seen in recent events such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Bank_Oslo_2002_Protests" title="World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests">World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests</a>, the <a href="/wiki/October_Rebellion" title="October Rebellion">October Rebellion</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization_Ministerial_Conference_of_1999_protest_activity" title="World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity">Battle of Seattle</a>. Such demonstrations have occurred all over the world, even among the Brazilian <a href="/wiki/Kayapo_people" title="Kayapo people">Kayapo people</a>.</p>
<p>Another source of criticism has been the tradition of having an American head the bank, implemented because the United States provides the majority of World Bank funding. "When economists from the World Bank visit poor countries to dispense cash and advice", observed <i><a href="/wiki/The_Economist" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> in 2012, "they routinely tell governments to reject <a href="/wiki/Cronyism" title="Cronyism">cronyism</a> and fill each important job with the best candidate available. It is good advice. The World Bank should take it." Jim Yong Kim, a Korean-American, is the most recently appointed president of the World Bank.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Structural_adjustment">Structural adjustment</span></h3>
<p>The effect of <a href="/wiki/Structural_adjustment" title="Structural adjustment">structural adjustment</a> policies on poor countries has been one of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The <a href="/wiki/1979_energy_crisis" title="1979 energy crisis">1979 energy crisis</a> plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with <a href="/wiki/Structural_adjustment_loan" title="Structural adjustment loan">structural adjustment loans</a>, which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging <a href="/wiki/Production_(economics)" title="Production (economics)">production</a>, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exchange_rates" title="Exchange rates">exchange rates</a> and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fairness_of_assistance_conditions">Fairness of assistance conditions</span></h3>
<p>Some critics, most prominently the author <a href="/wiki/Naomi_Klein" title="Naomi Klein">Naomi Klein</a>, are of the opinion that the World Bank Group's loans and aid have unfair conditions attached to them that reflect the interests, financial power and political doctrines (notably the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Consensus" title="Washington Consensus">Washington Consensus</a>) of the Bank and, by extension, the countries that are most influential within it. Among other allegations, Klein says the Group's credibility was damaged "when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan; when it demanded that Tanzania privatise its water system; when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch; when it demanded labour 'flexibility' in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami; when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in post-invasion Iraq".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sovereign_immunity">Sovereign immunity</span></h3>
<p>The World Bank requires <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_immunity" title="Sovereign immunity">sovereign immunity</a> from countries it deals with. Sovereign immunity waives a holder from all legal liability for their actions. It is proposed that this immunity from responsibility is a "shield which The World Bank wants to resort to, for escaping accountability and security by the people." As the United States has veto power, it can prevent the World Bank from taking action against its interests.</p>
