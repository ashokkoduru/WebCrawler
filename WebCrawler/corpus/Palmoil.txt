<p><b>Palm oil</b> (also known as <b>dendÃª oil</b>, from Portuguese) is an edible <a href="/wiki/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oil</a> derived from the <a href="/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Mesocarp" title="Fruit anatomy">mesocarp</a> (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the <a href="/wiki/Elaeis" title="Elaeis">oil palms</a>, primarily the African oil palm <i><a href="/wiki/Elaeis_guineensis" title="Elaeis guineensis">Elaeis guineensis</a></i>, and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm <i><a href="/wiki/Elaeis_oleifera" title="Elaeis oleifera">Elaeis oleifera</a></i> and the maripa palm <i><a href="/wiki/Attalea_maripa" title="Attalea maripa">Attalea maripa</a></i>.</p>
<p>Palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beta-carotene" title="Beta-carotene">beta-carotene</a> content. It is not to be confused with <a href="/wiki/Palm_kernel_oil" title="Palm kernel oil">palm kernel oil</a> derived from the <a href="/wiki/Palm_kernel" title="Palm kernel">kernel</a> of the same fruit, or <a href="/wiki/Coconut_oil" title="Coconut oil">coconut oil</a> derived from the kernel of the coconut palm (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cocos_nucifera" title="Cocos nucifera">Cocos nucifera</a></i>). The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carotenoids" title="Carotenoids">carotenoids</a> and is not red), and in <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fat</a> content: palm mesocarp oil is 41% saturated, while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated fats, respectively.</p>
<p>Along with coconut oil, palm oil is one of the few highly saturated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vegetable_fat" title="Vegetable fat">vegetable fats</a> and is semi-solid at <a href="/wiki/Room_temperature" title="Room temperature">room temperature</a>.</p>
<p>Palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and parts of <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. Its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost and the high oxidative stability (<a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturation</a>) of the refined product when used for frying.</p>
<p>The use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups; the high oil yield of the trees has encouraged wider cultivation, leading to the clearing of forests in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia in order to make space for oil-palm <a href="/wiki/Monoculture" title="Monoculture">monoculture</a>. This has resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the <a href="/wiki/Orangutan" title="Orangutan">orangutan</a>, of which both species are endangered; one species in particular, the <a href="/wiki/Sumatran_orangutan" title="Sumatran orangutan">Sumatran orangutan</a>, has been listed as <a href="/wiki/Critically_endangered" title="Critically endangered">critically endangered</a>. In 2004, an industry group called the <a href="/wiki/Roundtable_on_Sustainable_Palm_Oil" title="Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil">Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</a> (RSPO) was formed to work with the palm oil industry to address these concerns. Additionally, in 1992, in response to concerns about deforestation, the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Malaysia" title="Government of Malaysia">Government of Malaysia</a> pledged to limit the expansion of palm oil plantations by retaining a minimum of half the nation's land as forest cover.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>Human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years; in the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at <a href="/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt" title="Abydos, Egypt">Abydos</a> dating back to 3,000 BCE. It is believed that Arab traders brought the oil palm to Egypt. Some argue that it is not possible that Arab traders could have brought the oil palm to ancient Egypt, as the Arabs did not settle in Africa until the 8th century CE. It is more likely that the oil palm was brought to Ancient Egypt (Kemet) by its founding peoples who migrated from other regions of the African continent.</p>
<p>Palm oil from <i>Elaeis guineensiss</i> has long been recognized in <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" title="West Africa">West</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_Africa" title="Central Africa">Central African</a> countries, and is widely used as a <a href="/wiki/Cooking_oil" title="Cooking oil">cooking oil</a>. European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> traders, for use as an industrial <a href="/wiki/Lubricant" title="Lubricant">lubricant</a> for machinery during Britain's <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Palm oil formed the basis of <a href="/wiki/Soap" title="Soap">soap</a> products, such as <a href="/wiki/Lever_Brothers" title="Lever Brothers">Lever Brothers</a>' (now <a href="/wiki/Unilever" title="Unilever">Unilever</a>) "<a href="/wiki/Sunlight_(cleaning_product)" title="Sunlight (cleaning product)">Sunlight</a>" soap, and the American <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palmolive_(soap)" title="Palmolive (soap)">Palmolive</a> brand.</p>
<p>By around 1870, palm oil constituted the primary export of some West African countries, such as <a href="/wiki/Ghana" title="Ghana">Ghana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nigeria" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, although this was overtaken by <a href="/wiki/Cocoa_bean" title="Cocoa bean">cocoa</a> in the 1880s.</p>

A recent rise in the use of palm oil in the food industry has partly come from changed labelling requirements that have caused a switch away from using trans fats. Palm oil has been found to be a reasonable replacement for trans fats; however, a small study conducted in 2009 found that palm oil may not be a good substitute for trans fats for individuals with already-elevated LDL levels.

Palm oil methyl ester is created through a process called <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a>. Palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends. Palm oil biodiesel meets the European <a href="/wiki/EN_14214" title="EN 14214">EN 14214</a> standard for biodiesels. Hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel is produced by direct <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenolysis" title="Hydrogenolysis">hydrogenolysis</a> of the fat into alkanes and propane.

<p>The organic waste matter that is produced when processing oil palm, including oil palm shells and oil palm fruit bunches, can also be used to produce energy. This waste material can be converted into pellets that can be used as a biofuel. Additionally, palm oil that has been used to fry foods can be converted into methyl esters for biodiesel. The used cooking oil is chemically treated to create a biodiesel similar to petroleum diesel.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>In 2012, the annual revenue received by Indonesia and Malaysia together, the top two producers of palm oil, was $40 billion. Between 1962 and 1982 global exports of palm oil increased from around half a million to 2.4 million tonnes annually and in 2008 world production of palm oil and palm kernel oil amounted to 48 million tonnes. According to FAO forecasts by 2020 the global demand for palm oil will double, and triple by 2050.</p>

In 2006, the Colombian plantation owners' association, Fedepalma, reported that oil palm cultivation was expanding to 1,000,000 hectares (3,900Â sqÂ mi). This expansion is being funded, in part, by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development" title="United States Agency for International Development">United States Agency for International Development</a> to resettle disarmed <a href="/wiki/Paramilitary" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> members on arable land, and by the Colombian government, which proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to 7,000,000 hectares (27,000Â sqÂ mi) by 2020, including oil palms. Fedepalma states that its members are following sustainable guidelines.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_label_regulations">Food label regulations</span></h3>
<p>Previously, palm oil could be listed as "vegetable fat" or "vegetable oil" on food labels in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU). From December 2014, food packaging in the EU is no longer allowed to use the generic terms "vegetable fat" or "vegetable oil" in the ingredients list. Food producers are required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used, including palm oil. Vegetable oils and fats can be grouped together in the ingredients list under the term "vegetable oils" or "vegetable fats" but this must be followed by the type of vegetable origin (e.g. palm, sunflower or rapeseed) and the phrase "in varying proportions".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supply_chain_institutions">Supply chain institutions</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</b> (RSPO) was established in 2004 following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts resulting from palm oil production. The organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production. Products containing <b>Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO)</b> can carry the RSPO trademark. Members of the RSPO include palm oil producers, environmental groups, and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products.</p>
<p>The RSPO is applying different types of programmes to supply palm oil to producers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Book and claim: no guarantee that the end product contains certified sustainable palm oil, supports RSPO-certified growers and farmers</li>
<li>Identity preserved: the end user is able to trace the palm oil back to a specific single mill and its supply base (plantations)</li>
<li>Segregated: this option guarantees that the end product contains certified palm oil</li>
<li>Mass balance: the refinery is only allowed to sell the same amount of mass balance palm oil as the amount of certified sustainable palm oil purchased</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/wiki/GreenPalm" title="GreenPalm">GreenPalm</a> is one of the retailers executing the book and claim supply chain and trading programme. It guarantees that the palm oil producer is certified by the RSPO. Through GreenPalm the producer can certify a specified amount with the GreenPalm logo.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_to_trans_fats">Comparison to trans fats</span></h4>
<p>In response to negative reports on palm oil many food manufacturers transitioned to using hydrogenated vegetable oils in their products, which have also come under scrutiny for the impact these oils have on health.

The use of <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigration" title="Illegal immigration">illegal immigrants</a> in Malaysia has also raised concerns about working conditions within the palm oil industry.</p>
<p>Some social initiatives use palm oil cultivation as part of poverty alleviation strategies. Examples include the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's hybrid oil palm project in Western <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, which improves incomes and diets of local populations, and Malaysia's <a href="/wiki/Federal_Land_Development_Authority" title="Federal Land Development Authority">Federal Land Development Authority</a> and Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority, which both support rural development.</p>

<p>The use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food, leading to malnourishment in developing nations. This is known as the <a href="/wiki/Food_vs._fuel" title="Food vs. fuel">food versus fuel</a> debate. According to a 2008 report published in the <i><a href="/wiki/Renewable_and_Sustainable_Energy_Reviews" title="Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews">Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</a></i>, palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel. The production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies. According to a 2009 study published in the <i>Environmental Science and Policy</i> journal, palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future, resulting in the expansion of palm oil production, and therefore an increased supply of food.</p>

<p>Palm oil cultivation has been criticized for impacts on the natural environment, including <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, loss of natural habitats, which has threatened <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Critically_endangered_species" title="Critically endangered species">critically endangered species</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Orangutan" title="Orangutan">orangutan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sumatran_tiger" title="Sumatran tiger">Sumatran tiger</a>, and increased <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. Many palm oil plantations are built on top of existing peat bogs, and clearing the land for palm oil cultivation contributes to rising greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Efforts to portray palm oil cultivation as sustainable have been made by organizations including the <a href="/wiki/Roundtable_on_Sustainable_Palm_Oil" title="Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil">Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</a>, an industry group, and the Malaysian government, which has committed to preserve 50 percent of its total land area as forest. According to research conducted by the Tropical Peat Research Laboratory, a group studying palm oil cultivation in support of the industry, oil palm plantations act as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sink" title="Carbon sink">carbon sinks</a>, converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and, according to Malaysia's Second National Communication to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>, the plantations contribute to Malaysia's status as a net carbon sink.</p>
<p>Environmental groups such as <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth" title="Friends of the Earth">Friends of the Earth</a> oppose the use of palm oil biofuels, claiming that the <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> caused by oil palm plantations is more damaging for the climate than the benefits gained by switching to biofuel and utilizing the palms as carbon sinks.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roundtable_On_Sustainable_Palm_Oil_.28RSPO.29">Roundtable On Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Roundtable_on_Sustainable_Palm_Oil" title="Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil">Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</a></div>

<p>The <b>Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</b> (RSPO) was created in 2004 following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts related to palm oil production. The organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production. Products containing <b>Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO)</b> can carry the RSPO trademark. Members of the RSPO include palm oil producers, environmental groups and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products.</p>
<p>Palm oil growers who produce Certified Sustainable Palm Oil have been critical of the organization because, though they have met RSPO standards and assumed the costs associated with certification, the market demand for certified palm oil remains low. Low market demand has been attributed to the higher cost of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil, leading palm oil buyers to purchase cheaper non-certified palm oil. Palm oil is mostly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungible" title="Fungible">fungible</a>. In 2011, 12% of palm oil produced was certified "sustainable", though only half of that had the RSPO label. Even with such a low proportion being certified, <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> has argued that confectioners are avoiding responsibilities on sustainable palm oil, because it says that RSPO standards fall short of protecting rain forests and reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
