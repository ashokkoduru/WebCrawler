<p><b>Nuclear reprocessing</b> technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel. Reprocessing serves multiple purposes, whose relative importance has changed over time. Originally, reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. With the commercialization of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>, the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MOX_nuclear_fuel" title="MOX nuclear fuel">MOX nuclear fuel</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_reactor" title="Thermal reactor">thermal reactors</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Reprocessed_uranium" title="Reprocessed uranium">reprocessed uranium</a>, which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material, can in principle also be re-used as fuel, but that is only economical when uranium prices are high. Finally, a <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeder reactor</a> is not restricted to using recycled plutonium and uranium. It can employ all the <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a>, closing the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_cycle" title="Nuclear fuel cycle">nuclear fuel cycle</a> and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from <a href="/wiki/Natural_uranium" title="Natural uranium">natural uranium</a> by about 60 times.</p>
<p>Nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste, but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a>, the potential vulnerability to <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_terrorism" title="Nuclear terrorism">nuclear terrorism</a>, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. In the United States, the Obama administration stepped back from President Bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research. Nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in Europe, Russia and Japan.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The first large-scale nuclear reactors were built during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. These reactors were designed for the production of plutonium for use in <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. The only reprocessing required, therefore, was the extraction of the <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> (free of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission-product</a> contamination) from the spent <a href="/wiki/Natural_uranium" title="Natural uranium">natural uranium</a> fuel. In 1943, several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products. The first method selected, a precipitation process called the <a href="/wiki/Bismuth_phosphate_process" title="Bismuth phosphate process">bismuth phosphate process</a>, was developed and tested at the <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_nuclear_weapons" title="History of nuclear weapons">US weapons programs</a>. ORNL produced the first macroscopic quantities (grams) of separated plutonium with these processes.</p>
<p>The bismuth phosphate process was first operated on a large scale at the <a href="/wiki/Hanford_Site" title="Hanford Site">Hanford Site</a>, in the later part of 1944. It was successful for plutonium separation in the emergency situation existing then, but it had a significant weakness: the inability to recover uranium.</p>
<p>The first successful solvent extraction process for the recovery of pure uranium and plutonium was developed at ORNL in 1949. The <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a> process is the current method of extraction. Separation plants were also constructed at <a href="/wiki/Savannah_River_Site" title="Savannah River Site">Savannah River Site</a> and a smaller plant at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Valley_Reprocessing_Plant" title="West Valley Reprocessing Plant">West Valley Reprocessing Plant</a> which closed by 1972 because of its inability to meet new regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Reprocessing of civilian fuel has long been employed at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COGEMA_La_Hague_site" title="COGEMA La Hague site">COGEMA La Hague site</a> in France, the <a href="/wiki/Sellafield" title="Sellafield">Sellafield</a> site in the United Kingdom, the <a href="/wiki/Mayak" title="Mayak">Mayak</a> Chemical Combine in Russia, and at sites such as the Tokai plant in Japan, the Tarapur plant in India, and briefly at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Valley_Reprocessing_Plant" title="West Valley Reprocessing Plant">West Valley Reprocessing Plant</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In October 1976, concern of nuclear weapons proliferation (especially after <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology) led President <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a> to issue a <a href="/wiki/Presidential_directive" title="Presidential directive">Presidential directive</a> to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the U.S. On 7 April 1977, President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>. The key issue driving this policy was the serious threat of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear weapons proliferation</a> by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle, and to encourage other nations to follow the USA lead. After that, only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but did not provide the substantial subsidy that would have been necessary to start up commercial reprocessing.</p>
<p>In March 1999, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Energy" title="U.S. Department of Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a> (DOE) reversed its policy and signed a contract with a <a href="/wiki/Consortium" title="Consortium">consortium</a> of <a href="/wiki/Duke_Energy" title="Duke Energy">Duke Energy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Areva_NC" title="Areva NC">COGEMA</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stone_%26_Webster" title="Stone &amp; Webster">Stone &amp; Webster</a> (DCS) to design and operate a <a href="/wiki/MOX_fuel" title="MOX fuel">mixed oxide (MOX) fuel</a> fabrication facility. Site preparation at the Savannah River Site (South Carolina) began in October 2005. In 2011 the New York Times reported "...11 years after the government awarded a construction contract, the cost of the project has soared to nearly $5 billion. The vast concrete and steel structure is a half-finished hulk, and the government has yet to find a single customer, despite offers of lucrative subsidies." TVA (currently the most likely customer) said in April 2011 that it would delay a decision until it could see how MOX fuel performed in the nuclear accident at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi" title="Fukushima Daiichi">Fukushima Daiichi</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a></div>
<p><b>PUREX</b>, the current standard method, is an acronym standing for <i><b>P</b>lutonium and <b>U</b>ranium <b>R</b>ecovery by <b>EX</b>traction</i>. The PUREX process is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction" title="Liquid-liquid extraction">liquid-liquid extraction</a> method used to reprocess spent <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuel</a>, to extract <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, independent of each other, from the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">fission</a> products. This is the most developed and widely used process in the industry at present. When used on fuel from commercial power reactors the plutonium extracted typically contains too much Pu-240 to be considered "weapons-grade" plutonium, ideal for use in a nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, highly reliable nuclear weapons can be built at all levels of technical sophistication using reactor-grade plutonium. Moreover, reactors that are capable of refueling frequently can be used to produce <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">weapon-grade</a> plutonium, which can later be recovered using PUREX. Because of this, PUREX chemicals are monitored.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Modifications_of_PUREX">Modifications of PUREX</span></h4>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="UREX">UREX</span></h5>
<p>The PUREX process can be modified to make a <b>UREX</b> (<b>UR</b>anium <b>EX</b>traction) process which could be used to save space inside high level <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_waste" title="Nuclear waste">nuclear waste</a> disposal sites, such as the <a href="/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository" title="Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository">Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a>, by removing the uranium which makes up the vast majority of the mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as <a href="/wiki/Reprocessed_uranium" title="Reprocessed uranium">reprocessed uranium</a>.</p>
<p>The UREX process is a PUREX process which has been modified to prevent the plutonium from being extracted. This can be done by adding a plutonium <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reductant" title="Reductant">reductant</a> before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and &gt;95% of <a href="/wiki/Technetium" title="Technetium">technetium</a> are separated from each other and the other fission products and <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a>. The key is the addition of <a href="/wiki/Acetohydroxamic_acid" title="Acetohydroxamic acid">acetohydroxamic acid</a> (AHA) to the extraction and scrub sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and <a href="/wiki/Neptunium" title="Neptunium">neptunium</a>, providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the PUREX process.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="TRUEX">TRUEX</span></h5>
<p>Adding a second extraction agent, octyl(phenyl)-N, N-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide(CMPO) in combination with tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process can be turned into the <b>TRUEX</b> (<b>TR</b>ans<b>U</b>ranic <b>EX</b>traction) process. TRUEX was invented in the USA by Argonne National Laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. The idea is that by lowering the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_decay#Toxicity" title="Alpha decay">alpha activity</a> of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a <a href="/wiki/Solvation" title="Solvation">solvation</a> mechanism.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="DIAMEX">DIAMEX</span></h5>
<p>As an alternative to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (<b>DIAM</b>ide<b>EX</b>traction) process has the advantage of avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber). The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commissariat_%C3%A0_l%27%C3%A9nergie_atomique" title="Commissariat à l'énergie atomique">CEA</a>. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="SANEX">SANEX</span></h5>
<p><b>S</b>elective <b>A</b>cti<b>N</b>ide <b>EX</b>traction. As part of the management of minor actinides it has been proposed that the <a href="/wiki/Lanthanide" title="Lanthanide">lanthanides</a> and trivalent minor <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a> should be removed from the PUREX <a href="/wiki/Raffinate" title="Raffinate">raffinate</a> by a process such as DIAMEX or TRUEX. In order to allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel, the <a href="/wiki/Lanthanide" title="Lanthanide">lanthanides</a> must be removed. The lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron driven nuclear reaction. To date the extraction system for the SANEX process has not been defined, but currently several different research groups are working towards a process. For instance the French <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commissariat_%C3%A0_l%27%C3%A9nergie_atomique" title="Commissariat à l'énergie atomique">CEA</a> is working on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bis-triazinyl_pyridine" title="Bis-triazinyl pyridine">bis-triazinyl pyridine</a> (BTP) based process. Other systems such as the dithiophosphinic acids are being worked on by some other workers.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="UNEX">UNEX</span></h5>
<p>The <i><b>UN</b>iversal</i> <b>EX</b>traction process was developed in <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>; it is designed to completely remove the most troublesome <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioisotopes" title="Radioisotopes">radioisotopes</a> (Sr, Cs and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minor_actinides" title="Minor actinides">minor actinides</a>) from the raffinate remaining after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuel</a>. The chemistry is based upon the interaction of <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Strontium" title="Strontium">strontium</a> with <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol" title="Polyethylene glycol">polyethylene glycol</a>) and a <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> <a href="/wiki/Carborane" title="Carborane">carborane</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anion" title="Anion">anion</a> (known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide).

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Bismuth_phosphate">Bismuth phosphate</span></h5>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Bismuth_phosphate_process" title="Bismuth phosphate process">bismuth phosphate process</a> is an obsolete process that adds significant unnecessary material to the final radioactive waste. The bismuth phosphate process has been replaced by solvent extraction processes. The bismuth phosphate process was designed to extract <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> from aluminium-clad <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_rod" title="Nuclear fuel rod">nuclear fuel rods</a>, containing uranium. The fuel was decladded by boiling it in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caustic_soda" title="Caustic soda">caustic soda</a>. After decladding, the uranium metal was dissolved in <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a>.</p>
<p>The plutonium at this point is in the +4 oxidation state. It was then precipitated out of the solution by the addition of <a href="/wiki/Bismuth" title="Bismuth">bismuth</a> nitrate and <a href="/wiki/Phosphoric_acid" title="Phosphoric acid">phosphoric acid</a> to form the bismuth phosphate. The plutonium was <a href="/wiki/Coprecipitation" title="Coprecipitation">coprecipitated</a> with this. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supernatant" title="Supernatant">supernatant</a> liquid (containing many of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a>) was separated from the solid. The precipitate was then dissolved in nitric acid before the addition of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidant" title="Oxidant">oxidant</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Potassium_permanganate" title="Potassium permanganate">potassium permanganate</a> which converted the plutonium to PuO<sub>2</sub> (Pu VI), then a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dichromate" title="Dichromate">dichromate</a> salt was added to maintain the plutonium in the +6 oxidation state.</p>
<p>The bismuth phosphate was next re-precipitated leaving the plutonium in solution. Then an iron (II) salt such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ferrous_sulfate" title="Ferrous sulfate">ferrous sulfate</a> was added, and the plutonium re-precipitated again using a bismuth phosphate carrier precipitate. Then <a href="/wiki/Lanthanum" title="Lanthanum">lanthanum</a> salts and <a href="/wiki/Fluoride" title="Fluoride">fluoride</a> were added to create solid lanthanum fluoride which acted as a carrier for the plutonium. This was converted to the oxide by the action of an <a href="/wiki/Alkali" title="Alkali">alkali</a>. The lanthanum plutonium oxide was next collected and extracted with nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Hexone_or_redox">Hexone or redox</span></h5>
<p>This is a liquid-liquid extraction process which uses <a href="/wiki/Methyl_isobutyl_ketone" title="Methyl isobutyl ketone">methyl isobutyl ketone</a> as the extractant. The extraction is by a <i>solvation</i> mechanism. This process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent (aluminium <a href="/wiki/Nitrate" title="Nitrate">nitrate</a>) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. This process has been replaced by the PUREX process.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyroprocessing">Pyroprocessing</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Pyroprocessing" title="Pyroprocessing">Pyroprocessing</a></b> is a generic term for high-temperature methods. Solvents are <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt" title="Molten salt">molten salts</a> (e.g. LiCl+KCl or LiF+CaF2) and molten metals (e.g. cadmium, bismuth, magnesium) rather than water and organic compounds. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrorefining" title="Electrorefining">Electrorefining</a>, <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a>, and solvent-solvent extraction are common steps.</p>
<p>These processes are not currently in significant use worldwide, but they have been researched and developed at <a href="/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory" title="Argonne National Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The principles behind them are well understood, and no significant technical barriers exist to their adoption.</li>
<li>Readily applied to high-<a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnup</a> spent fuel and requires little cooling time, since the <a href="/wiki/Operating_temperature" title="Operating temperature">operating temperatures</a> are high already.</li>
<li>Does not use solvents containing hydrogen and carbon, which are <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">neutron moderators</a> creating risk of <a href="/wiki/Criticality_accident" title="Criticality accident">criticality accidents</a> and can absorb the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission product</a> <a href="/wiki/Tritium" title="Tritium">tritium</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Activation_product" title="Activation product">activation product</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon-14" title="Carbon-14">carbon-14</a> in dilute solutions that cannot be separated later.
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, <a href="#Voloxidation">voloxidation</a> can remove 99% of the tritium from used fuel and recover it in the form of a strong solution suitable for use as a supply of tritium.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More compact than aqueous methods, allowing on-site reprocessing at the reactor site, which avoids transportation of spent fuel and its security issues, instead storing a much smaller volume of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a> on site as <a href="/wiki/High-level_waste" title="High-level waste">high-level waste</a> until <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_decommissioning" title="Nuclear decommissioning">decommissioning</a>. For example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">Integral Fast Reactor</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molten_Salt_Reactor" title="Molten Salt Reactor">Molten Salt Reactor</a> fuel cycles are based on on-site pyroprocessing.</li>
<li>It can separate many or even all <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a> at once and produce highly radioactive fuel which is harder to manipulate for theft or making nuclear weapons. (However, the difficulty has been questioned.) In contrast the PUREX process was designed to separate plutonium only for weapons, and it also leaves the <a href="/wiki/Minor_actinide" title="Minor actinide">minor actinides</a> (<a href="/wiki/Americium" title="Americium">americium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Curium" title="Curium">curium</a>) behind, producing waste with more long-lived radioactivity.</li>
<li>Most of the radioactivity in roughly 10 to 10 years after the use of the nuclear fuel is produced by the actinides, since there are no fission products with half-lives in this range. These actinides can fuel <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_reactor" title="Fast reactor">fast reactors</a>, so extracting and reusing (fissioning) them reduces the long-term radioactivity of the wastes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Reprocessing as a whole is not currently (2005) in favor, and places that do reprocess already have PUREX plants constructed. Consequently, there is little demand for new pyrometalurgical systems, although there could be if the <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">Generation IV reactor</a> programs become reality.</li>
<li>The used salt from pyroprocessing is less suitable for conversion into glass than the waste materials produced by the PUREX process.</li>
<li>If the goal is to reduce the longevity of spent nuclear fuel in burner reactors, then better recovery rates of the minor actinides need to be achieved.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>PYRO-A</b> is a means of separating actinides (elements within the <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinide</a> family, generally heavier than U-235) from non-actinides. The spent fuel is placed in an <a href="/wiki/Anode" title="Anode">anode</a> <a href="/wiki/Basket" title="Basket">basket</a> which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte. An electric current is applied, causing the uranium metal (or sometimes oxide, depending on the spent fuel) to plate out on a solid metal cathode while the other actinides (and the rare earths) can be absorbed into a liquid <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> cathode. Many of the fission products (such as <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zirconium" title="Zirconium">zirconium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Strontium" title="Strontium">strontium</a>) remain in the salt. As alternatives to the molten cadmium electrode it is possible to use a molten <a href="/wiki/Bismuth" title="Bismuth">bismuth</a> cathode, or a solid aluminium cathode.</p>
<p>As an alternative to electrowinning, the wanted metal can be isolated by using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molten" title="Molten">molten</a> <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloy</a> of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electropositive" title="Electropositive">electropositive</a> metal and a less reactive metal.</p>
<p>Since the majority of the long term <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactivity" title="Radioactivity">radioactivity</a>, and volume, of spent fuel comes from actinides, removing the actinides produces waste that is more compact, and not nearly as dangerous over the long term. The radioactivity of this waste will then drop to the level of various naturally occurring minerals and ores within a few hundred, rather than thousands of, years.</p>
<p>The mixed actinides produced by pyrometallic processing can be used again as nuclear fuel, as they are virtually all either <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile" title="Fissile">fissile</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile</a>, though many of these materials would require a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_breeder_reactor" title="Fast breeder reactor">fast breeder reactor</a> in order to be burned efficiently. In a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_neutron" title="Thermal neutron">thermal neutron</a> spectrum, the concentrations of several heavy actinides (<a href="/wiki/Curium" title="Curium">curium-242</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-240" title="Plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a>) can become quite high, creating fuel that is substantially different from the usual uranium or mixed uranium-plutonium oxides (MOX) that most current reactors were designed to use.</p>
<p>Another pyrochemical process, the <b>PYRO-B</b> process, has been developed for the processing and recycling of fuel from a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transmuter_reactor" title="Transmuter reactor">transmuter reactor</a> ( a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_breeder_reactor" title="Fast breeder reactor">fast breeder reactor</a> designed to convert transuranic nuclear waste into fission products ).

In the PYRO-B processing of such fuel, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrorefining" title="Electrorefining">electrorefining</a> step is used to separate the residual transuranic elements from the fission products and recycle the transuranics to the reactor for fissioning. Newly generated technetium and iodine are extracted for incorporation into transmutation targets, and the other fission products are sent to waste.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Voloxidation">Voloxidation</span></h4>
<p>Voloxidation (for <i>volumetric oxidation</i>) involves heating oxide fuel with oxygen, sometimes with alternating oxidation and reduction, or alternating oxidation by <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> to <a href="/wiki/Uranium_trioxide" title="Uranium trioxide">uranium trioxide</a> with decomposition by heating back to <a href="/wiki/Triuranium_octoxide" title="Triuranium octoxide">triuranium octoxide</a>. A major purpose is to capture <a href="/wiki/Tritium" title="Tritium">tritium</a> as tritiated water vapor before further processing where it would be difficult to retain the tritium. Other volatile elements leave the fuel and must be recovered, especially <a href="/wiki/Iodine" title="Iodine">iodine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Technetium" title="Technetium">technetium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Carbon-14" title="Carbon-14">carbon-14</a>. Voloxidation also breaks up the fuel or increases its surface area to enhance penetration of reagents in following reprocessing steps.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Volatilization_in_isolation">Volatilization in isolation</span></h4>
<p>Simply heating spent oxide fuel in an inert atmosphere or vacuum at a temperature between 700 °C and 1000 °C as a first reprocessing step can remove several volatile elements, including caesium whose isotope <a href="/wiki/Caesium-137" title="Caesium-137">caesium-137</a> emits about half of the heat produced by the spent fuel over the following 100 years of cooling (however, most of the other half is from <a href="/wiki/Strontium-90" title="Strontium-90">strontium-90</a> which remains). The estimated overall mass balance for 20,000 grams of processed fuel with 2,000 grams of cladding is:</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fluoride_volatility">Fluoride volatility</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Fluoride_volatility" title="Fluoride volatility">Fluoride volatility</a></div>

<p>In the fluoride volatility process, <a href="/wiki/Fluorine" title="Fluorine">fluorine</a> is reacted with the fuel. Fluorine is so much more reactive than even <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> that small particles of ground oxide fuel will burst into flame when dropped into a chamber full of fluorine. This is known as flame fluorination; the heat produced helps the reaction proceed. Most of the <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, which makes up the bulk of the fuel, is converted to <a href="/wiki/Uranium_hexafluoride" title="Uranium hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a>, the form of uranium used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uranium_enrichment" title="Uranium enrichment">uranium enrichment</a>, which has a very low boiling point. <a href="/wiki/Technetium" title="Technetium">Technetium</a>, the main <a href="/wiki/Long-lived_fission_product" title="Long-lived fission product">long-lived fission product</a>, is also efficiently converted to its volatile hexafluoride. A few other elements also form similarly volatile hexafluorides, pentafluorides, or heptafluorides. The volatile fluorides can be separated from excess fluorine by condensation, then separated from each other by <a href="/wiki/Fractional_distillation" title="Fractional distillation">fractional distillation</a> or selective <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">reduction</a>. <a href="/wiki/Uranium_hexafluoride" title="Uranium hexafluoride">Uranium hexafluoride</a> and <a href="/wiki/Technetium_hexafluoride" title="Technetium hexafluoride">technetium hexafluoride</a> have very similar boiling points and vapor pressures, which makes complete separation more difficult.</p>
<p>Many of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a> volatilized are the same ones volatilized in non-fluorinated, higher-temperature volatilization, such as <a href="/wiki/Iodine" title="Iodine">iodine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tellurium" title="Tellurium">tellurium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>; notable differences are that <a href="/wiki/Technetium" title="Technetium">technetium</a> is volatilized, but <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> is not.</p>
<p>Some transuranium elements such as <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neptunium" title="Neptunium">neptunium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Americium" title="Americium">americium</a> can form volatile fluorides, but these compounds are not stable when the fluorine partial pressure is decreased. Most of the plutonium and some of the uranium will initially remain in ash which drops to the bottom of the flame fluorinator. The plutonium-uranium ratio in the ash may even approximate the composition needed for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_neutron_reactor" title="Fast neutron reactor">fast neutron reactor</a> fuel. Further fluorination of the ash can remove all the uranium, <a href="/wiki/Neptunium" title="Neptunium">neptunium</a>, and plutonium as volatile fluorides; however, some other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minor_actinides" title="Minor actinides">minor actinides</a> may not form volatile fluorides and instead remain with the alkaline fission products. Some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Noble_metals" title="Noble metals">noble metals</a> may not form fluorides at all, but remain in metallic form; however <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium" title="Ruthenium">ruthenium</a> hexafluoride is relatively stable and volatile.</p>
<p>Distillation of the residue at higher temperatures can separate lower-boiling <a href="/wiki/Transition_metal" title="Transition metal">transition metal</a> fluorides and <a href="/wiki/Alkali_metal" title="Alkali metal">alkali metal</a> (Cs, Rb) fluorides from higher-boiling <a href="/wiki/Lanthanide" title="Lanthanide">lanthanide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal" title="Alkaline earth metal">alkaline earth metal</a> (Sr, Ba) and <a href="/wiki/Yttrium" title="Yttrium">yttrium</a> fluorides. The temperatures involved are much higher, but can be lowered somewhat by distilling in a vacuum. If a carrier salt like <a href="/wiki/Lithium_fluoride" title="Lithium fluoride">lithium fluoride</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sodium_fluoride" title="Sodium fluoride">sodium fluoride</a> is being used as a solvent, high-temperature distillation is a way to separate the carrier salt for reuse.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">Molten salt reactor</a> designs carry out fluoride volatility reprocessing continuously or at frequent intervals. The goal is to return <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a> to the molten fuel mixture for eventual fission, while removing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a> that are <a href="/wiki/Neutron_poison" title="Neutron poison">neutron poisons</a>, or that can be more securely stored outside the reactor core while awaiting eventual transfer to permanent storage.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chloride_volatility_and_solubility">Chloride volatility and solubility</span></h4>
<p>Many of the elements that form volatile high-<a href="/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)" title="Valence (chemistry)">valence</a> fluorides will also form volatile high-valence chlorides. Chlorination and distillation is another possible method for separation. The sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides; for example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zirconium_tetrachloride" title="Zirconium tetrachloride">zirconium tetrachloride</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tin_tetrachloride" title="Tin tetrachloride">tin tetrachloride</a> have relatively low boiling points of 331 °C and 114.1 °C. Chlorination has even been proposed as a method for removing zirconium fuel cladding, instead of mechanical decladding.</p>
<p>Chlorides are likely to be easier than fluorides to later convert back to other compounds, such as oxides.</p>
<p>Chlorides remaining after volatilization may also be separated by solubility in water. Chlorides of alkaline elements like <a href="/wiki/Americium" title="Americium">americium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Curium" title="Curium">curium</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lanthanides" title="Lanthanides">lanthanides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strontium" title="Strontium">strontium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> are more soluble than those of <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neptunium" title="Neptunium">neptunium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Zirconium" title="Zirconium">zirconium</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Radioanalytical_separations">Radioanalytical separations</span></h3>
<p>In order to determine the distribution of radioactive metals for analytical purposes, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solvent_Impregnated_Resins_(SIRs)" title="Solvent Impregnated Resins (SIRs)">Solvent Impregnated Resins (SIRs)</a> can be used. SIRs are porous particles, which contain an extractant inside their pores. This approach avoids the liquid-liquid separation step required in conventional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction" title="Liquid-liquid extraction">liquid-liquid extraction</a>. For the preparation of SIRs for radioanalytical separations, organic Amberlite XAD-4 or XAD-7 can be used. Possible extractants are e.g. trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride(CYPHOS IL-101) or N,N0-dialkyl-N,N0-diphenylpyridine-2,6-dicarboxyamides (R-PDA; R = butyl, octy I, decyl, dodecyl).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h2>
<p>The relative economics of reprocessing-waste disposal and interim storage-direct disposal has been the focus of much debate over the past ten years. Studies have modeled the total fuel cycle costs of a reprocessing-recycling system based on one-time recycling of plutonium in existing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_reactor" title="Thermal reactor">thermal reactors</a> (as opposed to the proposed <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeder reactor</a> cycle) and compare this to the total costs of an open fuel cycle with direct disposal. The range of results produced by these studies is very wide, but all are agreed that under current (2005) economic conditions the reprocessing-recycle option is the more costly.</p>
<p>If reprocessing is undertaken only to reduce the radioactivity level of spent fuel it should be taken into account that spent nuclear fuel becomes less radioactive over time. After 40 years its radioactivity drops by 99.9%, though it still takes over a thousand years for the level of radioactivity to approach that of natural uranium. However the level of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic_element" title="Transuranic element">transuranic elements</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, remains high for over 100,000 years, so if not reused as nuclear fuel, then those elements need secure disposal because of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> reasons as well as radiation hazard.</p>
<p>On 25 October 2011 a commission of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission revealed during a meeting calculations about the costs of recycling nuclear fuel for power generation. These costs could be twice the costs of direct geological disposal of spent fuel: the cost of extracting plutonium and handling spent fuel was estimated at 1.98 to 2.14 yen per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Discarding the spent fuel as waste would cost only 1 to 1.35 yen per kilowatt-hour.</p>
<p>In July 2004 Japanese newspapers reported that the Japanese Government had estimated the costs of disposing radioactive waste, contradicting claims four months earlier that no such estimates had been made. The cost of non-reprocessing options was estimated to be between a quarter and a third ($5.5–7.9 billion) of the cost of reprocessing ($24.7 billion). At the end of the year 2011 it became clear that Masaya Yasui, who had been director of the Nuclear Power Policy Planning Division in 2004, had instructed his subordinate in April 2004 to conceal the data. The fact that the data were deliberately concealed obliged the ministry to re-investigate the case and to reconsider whether to punish the officials involved.</p>
