<p><b>Meat</b> is animal <a href="/wiki/Flesh" title="Flesh">flesh</a> that is eaten as <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a>. Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, pigs and cattle, and eventually their use in meat production on an industrial scale.</p>
<p>Meat is mainly composed of water, <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a>. It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. Unprocessed meat will <a href="/wiki/Meat_spoilage" title="Meat spoilage">spoil or rot</a> within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>.</p>
<p>Most often, <i>meat</i> refers to <a href="/wiki/Skeletal_muscle" title="Skeletal muscle">skeletal muscle</a> and associated <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a> and other tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as <a href="/wiki/Offal" title="Offal">offal</a>. <i>Meat</i> is sometimes also used in a more restrictive sense – the flesh of <a href="/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fish_(food)" title="Fish (food)">fish</a>, other <a href="/wiki/Seafood" title="Seafood">seafood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poultry" title="Poultry">poultry</a> or other animals.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>meat</i> comes from the <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> word <i>mete</i>, which referred to food in general. The term is related to <i>mad</i> in <a href="/wiki/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a>, <i>mat</i> in <a href="/wiki/Swedish_language" title="Swedish language">Swedish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_language" title="Norwegian language">Norwegian</a>, and <i>matur</i> in <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_language" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Faroese_language" title="Faroese language">Faroese</a>, which also mean 'food'. The word <i>mete</i> also exists in <a href="/wiki/Old_Frisian" title="Old Frisian">Old Frisian</a> (and to a lesser extent, modern <a href="/wiki/West_Frisian_language" title="West Frisian language">West Frisian</a>) to denote important food, differentiating it from <i>swiets</i> (sweets) and <i>dierfied</i> (animal feed).</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Paleontology" title="Paleontology">Paleontological</a> evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of even the earliest humans. Early <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as <a href="/wiki/Bison" title="Bison">bison</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deer" title="Deer">deer</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> of animals, of which we have evidence dating back to the end of the <a href="/wiki/Last_glacial_period" title="Last glacial period">last glacial period</a> (c. 10,000 BC), allowed the systematic production of meat and the <a href="/wiki/Animal_husbandry" title="Animal husbandry">breeding</a> of animals with a view to improving meat production. The animals which are now the principal sources of meat were domesticated in conjunction with the development of early civilizations:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Sheep" title="Sheep">Sheep</a>, originating from western Asia, were domesticated with the help of dogs prior to the establishment of settled <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, likely as early as the 8th millennium BC. Several breeds of sheep were established in ancient <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a> by 3500–3000 BC. Presently, more than 200 <a href="/wiki/List_of_sheep_breeds" title="List of sheep breeds">sheep-breeds</a> exist.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">Cattle</a> were domesticated in Mesopotamia after settled agriculture was established about 5000 BC, and several breeds were established by 2500 BC. Modern domesticated cattle fall into the groups <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bos_taurus" title="Bos taurus">Bos taurus</a></i> (European cattle) and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bos_indicus" title="Bos indicus">Bos indicus</a></i> (zebu), both descended from the now-extinct <a href="/wiki/Aurochs" title="Aurochs">aurochs</a>. The breeding of <a href="/wiki/Beef_cattle" title="Beef cattle">beef cattle</a>, cattle optimized for meat production as opposed to animals best suited for draught or dairy purposes, began in the middle of the 18th century.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Domestic_pig" title="Domestic pig">Domestic pigs</a>, which are descended from <a href="/wiki/Wild_boar" title="Wild boar">wild boars</a>, are known to have existed about 2500 BC in modern-day Hungary and in <a href="/wiki/Troy" title="Troy">Troy</a>; earlier pottery from <a href="/wiki/Jericho" title="Jericho">Jericho</a> and Egypt depicts wild pigs. <a href="/wiki/Pork" title="Pork">Pork</a> sausages and <a href="/wiki/Ham" title="Ham">hams</a> were of great commercial importance in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greco-Roman" title="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> times. Pigs continue to be bred intensively as they are being optimized to produce meat best suited for specific meat products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other animals are or have been raised or hunted for their flesh. The type of meat consumed varies much between different cultures, changes over time, depending on factors such as tradition and the availability of the animals. The amount and kind of meat consumed also varies by income, both between countries and within a given country.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Horse_meat" title="Horse meat">Horses</a> are commonly eaten in France, Italy, Germany and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, among other countries. Horses and other large <a href="/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a> were hunted during the late <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> in western Europe.</li>

Dogs are also occasionally eaten in the <a href="/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> regions.

</ul>
<p>Modern agriculture employs a number of techniques, such as <a href="/wiki/Progeny_testing" title="Progeny testing">progeny testing</a>, to speed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Artificial_selection" title="Artificial selection">artificial selection</a> by breeding animals to rapidly acquire the qualities desired by meat producers. For instance, in the wake of well-publicised health concerns associated with <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fats</a> in the 1980s, the fat content of United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed methods of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Butchery" title="Butchery">butchery</a>. Methods of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a> aimed at improving the meat production qualities of animals are now also becoming available.</p>

<p>Even though it is a very old industry, meat production continues to be shaped strongly by the evolving demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, which are better suited to producing such cuts. Even more animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, especially the more agile and mobile species, whose muscles tend to be developed better than those of cattle, sheep or pigs. Examples are the various <a href="/wiki/Antelope" title="Antelope">antelope</a> species, the <a href="/wiki/Zebra" title="Zebra">zebra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_buffalo" title="Water buffalo">water buffalo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">camel</a>, as well as non-mammals, such as the <a href="/wiki/Crocodile" title="Crocodile">crocodile</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emu" title="Emu">emu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ostrich" title="Ostrich">ostrich</a>. Another important trend in contemporary meat production is <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a> which, while providing no <a href="/wiki/Organoleptic" title="Organoleptic">organoleptic</a> benefit to meat so produced, meets an increasing demand for organic meat.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumption">Consumption</span></h2>
<p>Meat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or religious preferences, as well as economic conditions. <a href="/wiki/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">Vegetarians</a> choose not to eat meat because of ethical, economic, environmental, religious or health concerns that are associated with meat production and consumption.</p>

<p>According to the analysis of the FAO the overall consumption for <a href="#Red_and_white_meat">white meat</a> between 1990 and 2009 has dramatically increased. For example, poultry meat has increased by 76.6% per kilo per capita and pig meat by 19.7%. However, on the contrary, bovine meat has decreased from 10.4 kilograms (23 lb)/capita in 1990 to 9.6 kilograms (21 lb)/capita in 2009.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Growth_and_development_of_meat_animals">Growth and development of meat animals</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Agricultural_science" title="Agricultural science">Agricultural science</a> has identified several factors bearing on the growth and development of meat in animals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetics">Genetics</span></h3>

<p>Several economically important traits in meat animals are heritable to some degree (see the table to the right) and can thus be selected for by <a href="/wiki/Animal_breeding" title="Animal breeding">animal breeding</a>. In cattle, certain growth features are controlled by <a href="/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)" title="Dominance (genetics)">recessive genes</a> which have not so far been controlled, complicating breeding. One such trait is <a href="/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarfism</a>; another is the doppelender or "<a href="/wiki/Myostatin" title="Myostatin">double muscling</a>" condition, which causes <a href="/wiki/Muscle_hypertrophy" title="Muscle hypertrophy">muscle hypertrophy</a> and thereby increases the animal's commercial value. <a href="/wiki/Genetic_analysis" title="Genetic analysis">Genetic analysis</a> continues to reveal the genetic mechanisms that control numerous aspects of the <a href="/wiki/Endocrine_system" title="Endocrine system">endocrine system</a> and, through it, meat growth and quality.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">Genetic engineering</a> techniques can shorten breeding programmes significantly because they allow for the identification and isolation of <a href="/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a> coding for desired traits, and for the reincorporation of these genes into the animal <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To enable such manipulation, research is ongoing (as of 2006) to <a href="/wiki/Genome_project" title="Genome project">map the entire genome</a> of sheep, cattle and pigs. Some research has already seen commercial application. For instance, a <a href="/wiki/Recombinant_DNA" title="Recombinant DNA">recombinant</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bacterium" title="Bacterium">bacterium</a> has been developed which improves the digestion of grass in the <a href="/wiki/Rumen" title="Rumen">rumen</a> of cattle, and some specific features of muscle fibres have been genetically altered.</p>
<p>Experimental <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reproductive_cloning" title="Reproductive cloning">reproductive cloning</a> of commercially important meat animals such as sheep, pig or cattle has been successful. The multiple asexual reproduction of animals bearing desirable traits can thus be anticipated, although this is not yet practical on a commercial scale.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</span></h3>
<p>Heat regulation in <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> is of great economic significance, because mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to retard it. Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one. Static <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic fields</a>, for reasons still unknown, also retard animal development.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutrition">Nutrition</span></h3>
<p>The quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal's <i>plane of nutrition</i>, i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree, however, about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcase composition.</p>
<p>The composition of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, is also an important factor regulating animal growth. <a href="/wiki/Ruminant" title="Ruminant">Ruminants</a>, which may digest <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a>, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also <i><a href="/wiki/Meat#Environmental_impact" title="Meat">Environmental impact</a></i> below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Formalin" title="Formalin">formalin</a> to protect <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> during their passage through the <a href="/wiki/Rumen" title="Rumen">rumen</a>, the recycling of <a href="/wiki/Manure" title="Manure">manure</a> by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a> to protein through microbial action.</p>
<p>In plant feed, environmental factors influence the availability of crucial <a href="/wiki/Nutrient" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a> or <a href="/wiki/Micronutrient" title="Micronutrient">micronutrients</a>, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments. In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a>, cattle are being fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency of beef production. Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> deficiency in the soil. Plant <a href="/wiki/Toxin" title="Toxin">toxins</a> are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sodium_fluoracetate" title="Sodium fluoracetate">sodium fluoracetate</a>, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cellular_metabolism" title="Cellular metabolism">cellular metabolism</a>. Certain man-made <a href="/wiki/Pollutant" title="Pollutant">pollutants</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Methylmercury" title="Methylmercury">methylmercury</a> and some <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticide</a> residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioaccumulate" title="Bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a> in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_intervention">Human intervention</span></h3>
<p>Meat producers may seek to improve the <a href="/wiki/Fertility" title="Fertility">fertility</a> of female animals through the administration of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gonadotrophic" title="Gonadotrophic">gonadotrophic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ovulation" title="Ovulation">ovulation</a>-inducing <a href="/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a>. In pig production, <a href="/wiki/Domestic_pig" title="Domestic pig">sow</a> infertility is a common problem — possibly due to excessive fatness. No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals. <a href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination" title="Artificial insemination">Artificial insemination</a> is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Growth_hormone" title="Growth hormone">Growth hormones</a>, particularly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anabolic" title="Anabolic">anabolic</a> agents such as <a href="/wiki/Steroid" title="Steroid">steroids</a>, are used in some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals. This practice has given rise to the <a href="/wiki/Beef_hormone_controversy" title="Beef hormone controversy">beef hormone controversy</a>, an international trade dispute. It may also decrease the tenderness of meat, although research on this is inconclusive, and have other effects on the composition of the muscle flesh. Where <a href="/wiki/Castration" title="Castration">castration</a> is used to improve control over male animals, its side effects are also counteracted by the administration of hormones.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sedative" title="Sedative">Sedatives</a> may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and increase weight gain. The feeding of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antibiotic" title="Antibiotic">antibiotics</a> to certain animals has been shown to improve growth rates also. This practice is particularly prevalent in the USA, but has been banned in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a>, partly because it causes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance" title="Antibiotic resistance">antibiotic resistance</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogenic</a> microorganisms.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biochemical_composition">Biochemical composition</span></h2>
<p>Numerous aspects of the biochemical composition of meat vary in complex ways depending on the species, breed, sex, age, plane of nutrition, training and exercise of the animal, as well as on the anatomical location of the musculature involved. Even between animals of the same litter and sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of intramuscular fat.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Main_constituents">Main constituents</span></h3>
<p>Adult mammalian <a href="/wiki/Muscle" title="Muscle">muscle</a> flesh consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent <a href="/wiki/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a> and 2.3 percent other soluble non-protein substances. These include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogenous" title="Nitrogenous">nitrogenous</a> compounds, such as <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>, and inorganic substances such as minerals.</p>
<p>Muscle proteins are either soluble in water (<a href="/wiki/Sarcoplasm" title="Sarcoplasm">sarcoplasmic</a> proteins, about 11.5 percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Myofibrillar" title="Myofibrillar">myofibrillar</a> proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass). There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins. Most of them – the glycolytic <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> – are involved in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glycolytic_pathway" title="Glycolytic pathway">glycolytic pathway</a>, i.e., the conversion of stored energy into muscle power. The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, <a href="/wiki/Myosin" title="Myosin">myosin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Actin" title="Actin">actin</a>, are responsible for the muscle's overall structure. The remaining protein mass consists of <a href="/wiki/Connective_tissue" title="Connective tissue">connective tissue</a> (<a href="/wiki/Collagen" title="Collagen">collagen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elastin" title="Elastin">elastin</a>) as well as <a href="/wiki/Organelle" title="Organelle">organelle</a> tissue.</p>
<p>Fat in meat can be either <a href="/wiki/Adipose_tissue" title="Adipose tissue">adipose tissue</a>, used by the animal to store energy and consisting of "true fats" (<a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">esters</a> of <a href="/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a> with <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a>), or intramuscular fat, which contains considerable quantities of <a href="/wiki/Phospholipid" title="Phospholipid">phospholipids</a> and of <a href="/wiki/Saponification" title="Saponification">unsaponifiable</a> constituents such as <a href="/wiki/Cholesterol" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Red_and_white_meat">Red and white meat</span></h3>

<p>Meat can be broadly classified as "red" or "white" depending on the concentration of <a href="/wiki/Myoglobin" title="Myoglobin">myoglobin</a> in muscle fibre. When myoglobin is exposed to <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, reddish oxymyoglobin develops, making myoglobin-rich meat appear red. The redness of meat depends on species, animal age, and fibre type: <a href="/wiki/Red_meat" title="Red meat">Red meat</a> contains more narrow muscle fibres that tend to operate over long periods without rest, while <a href="/wiki/White_meat" title="White meat">white meat</a> contains more broad fibres that tend to work in short fast bursts.</p>
<p>Generally, the meat of adult mammals such as <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">cows</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mutton" title="Mutton">sheep</a>, <a href="/wiki/Goat_meat" title="Goat meat">goats</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Horse_meat" title="Horse meat">horses</a> is considered red, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicken_(food)" title="Chicken (food)">chicken</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turkey_(food)" title="Turkey (food)">turkey</a> breast meat is considered white.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutritional_information">Nutritional information</span></h2>

<p>All <a href="/wiki/Muscle" title="Muscle">muscle</a> tissue is very high in protein, containing all of the <a href="/wiki/Essential_amino_acid" title="Essential amino acid">essential amino acids</a>, and in most cases is a good source of <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_B12" title="Vitamin B12">vitamin B<sub>12</sub></a>, <a href="/wiki/Selenium" title="Selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Niacin" title="Niacin">niacin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_B6" title="Vitamin B6">vitamin B<sub>6</sub></a>, <a href="/wiki/Choline" title="Choline">choline</a>, <a href="/wiki/Riboflavin" title="Riboflavin">riboflavin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a>. Several forms of meat are also high in <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_K" title="Vitamin K">vitamin K</a>. Muscle tissue is very low in carbohydrates and does not contain dietary fiber. While taste quality may vary between meats, the proteins, vitamins, and minerals available from meats are generally consistent.</p>
<p>The fat content of meat can vary widely depending on the <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> and <a href="/wiki/Breed" title="Breed">breed</a> of animal, the way in which the animal was raised, including what it was fed, the <a href="/wiki/Anatomy" title="Anatomy">anatomical</a> part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild animals such as <a href="/wiki/Deer" title="Deer">deer</a> are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Game_(food)" title="Game (food)">game</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Venison" title="Venison">venison</a>. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat. The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. However, the nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is <a href="/wiki/Cholesterol" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a> associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.</p>
<p>The table in this section compares the nutritional content of several types of meat. While each kind of meat has about the same content of protein and carbohydrates, there is a very wide range of fat content.</p>

<p>Meat is produced by killing an animal and cutting flesh out of it. These procedures are called <a href="/wiki/Animal_slaughter" title="Animal slaughter">slaughter</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Butchery" title="Butchery">butchery</a>, respectively.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport">Transport</span></h3>
<p>Upon reaching a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported <i>en masse</i> to the slaughterhouse. Depending on its length and circumstances, this may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die <i>en route</i>. Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat. In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and <a href="/wiki/Glycogen" title="Glycogen">glycogen</a>, and their <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in poor meat quality. Consequently, and also due to campaigning by <a href="/wiki/Animal_welfare" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a> groups, laws and industry practices in several countries tend to become more restrictive with respect to the duration and other circumstances of livestock transports.</p>

Stunning can be effected through <a href="/wiki/Asphyxia" title="Asphyxia">asphyxiating</a> the animals with <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, shooting them with a <a href="/wiki/Gun" title="Gun">gun</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Captive_bolt_pistol" title="Captive bolt pistol">captive bolt pistol</a>, or shocking them with electric current. In most forms of <a href="/wiki/Ritual_slaughter" title="Ritual slaughter">ritual slaughter</a>, stunning is not allowed.</p>
<p>Draining as much blood as possible from the carcass is necessary because blood causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms. The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the <a href="/wiki/Carotid_artery" title="Carotid artery">carotid artery</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Jugular_vein" title="Jugular vein">jugular vein</a> in cattle and sheep, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anterior_vena_cava" title="Anterior vena cava">anterior vena cava</a> in pigs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dressing_and_cutting">Dressing and cutting</span></h3>
<p>After exsanguination, the carcass is dressed; that is, the head, feet, hide (except hogs and some veal), excess fat, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viscera" title="Viscera">viscera</a> and <a href="/wiki/Offal" title="Offal">offal</a> are removed, leaving only bones and edible muscle. Cattle and pig carcases, but not those of sheep, are then split in half along the mid ventral axis, and the carcase is cut into wholesale pieces. The dressing and cutting sequence, long a province of manual labor, is progressively being fully automated.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conditioning">Conditioning</span></h3>

<p>Under hygienic conditions and without other treatment, meat can be stored at above its freezing point (–1.5 °C) for about six weeks without spoilage, during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness and flavor.</p>
<p>During the first day after death, <a href="/wiki/Glycolysis" title="Glycolysis">glycolysis</a> continues until the accumulation of <a href="/wiki/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a> causes the <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> to reach about 5.5. The remaining <a href="/wiki/Glycogen" title="Glycogen">glycogen</a>, about 18 g per kg, is believed to increase the water-holding capacity and tenderness of the flesh when cooked. <i><a href="/wiki/Rigor_mortis" title="Rigor mortis">Rigor mortis</a></i> sets in a few hours after death as <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a> is used up, causing <a href="/wiki/Actin" title="Actin">actin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Myosin" title="Myosin">myosin</a> to combine into rigid <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Actomyosin" title="Actomyosin">actomyosin</a> and lowering the meat's water-holding capacity, causing it to lose water ("weep"). In muscles that enter <i>rigor</i> in a contracted position, actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that is tough on cooking – hence again the need to prevent pre-slaughter stress in the animal.</p>
<p>Over time, the muscle proteins <a href="/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)" title="Denaturation (biochemistry)">denature</a> in varying degree, with the exception of the collagen and <a href="/wiki/Elastin" title="Elastin">elastin</a> of <a href="/wiki/Connective_tissue" title="Connective tissue">connective tissue</a>, and <i>rigor mortis</i> resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of <i>rigor</i>, but tough when cooked during <i>rigor.</i> As the muscle pigment <a href="/wiki/Myoglobin" title="Myoglobin">myoglobin</a> denatures, its iron <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidates</a>, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing <a href="/wiki/Proteolysis" title="Proteolysis">proteolysis</a> also contributes to conditioning. <a href="/wiki/Hypoxanthine" title="Hypoxanthine">Hypoxanthine</a>, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Additives">Additives</span></h3>

<p>When meat is industrially processed in preparation of consumption, it may be enriched with <a href="/wiki/Food_additive" title="Food additive">additives</a> to protect or modify its flavor or color, to improve its tenderness, juiciness or cohesiveness, or to aid with its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meat_preservation" title="Meat preservation">preservation</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impact">Environmental impact</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production" title="Environmental impact of meat production">Environmental impact of meat production</a></div>
<p>Various environmental effects are associated with meat production. Among these are greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, water use, water quality changes, and effects on grazed ecosystems.</p>
<p>The livestock sector may be the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, pesticides), and it contributes to emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts for over 8% of global human water use. It is by far the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, and overfishing. It is reportedly responsible for 14.5% of the world's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Although, a revised study of the environmental impact of livestock states that they account for 51% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is not only meat production that causes environmental damage, because according to production data compiled by the FAO, 74 percent of global livestock product tonnage in 2011 was accounted for by non-meat products.</p>
<p>The occurrence, nature and significance of environmental effects varies among livestock production systems. Grazing of livestock can be beneficial for some wildlife species, but not for others. Targeted grazing of livestock is used as a food-producing alternative to herbicide use in some vegetation management. Meat-producing livestock can provide environmental benefits through waste reduction, e.g. conversion of human-inedible residues of food crops. Manure from meat-producing livestock is used as fertilizer; it may be composted before application to food crops. Substitution of animal manures for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 MJ of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.</p>
<p>According to a report produced by <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a>'s (UNEP) international panel for sustainable resource management, a worldwide transition in the direction of a meat and dairy free diet is indispensable if adverse global climate change were to be prevented.</p>

<p>The spoilage of meat occurs, if untreated, in a matter of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent <a href="/wiki/Decomposition" title="Decomposition">decomposition</a> of meat by <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fungus" title="Fungus">fungi</a>, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time – though not indefinitely – if proper <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygiene</a> is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate <a href="/wiki/Food_safety" title="Food safety">food safety</a>, <a href="/wiki/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">food preservation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Food_storage" title="Food storage">food storage</a> procedures are applied. Without the application of <a href="/wiki/Preservative" title="Preservative">preservatives</a> and stabilizers, the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly decompose after cooking or processing, leading to an objectionable taste known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Warmed_over_flavor" title="Warmed over flavor">warmed over flavor</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Methods_of_preparation">Methods of preparation<span id="Processed_meat"></span></span></h2>

<p>Fresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption, or be processed, that is, treated for longer-term <a href="/wiki/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">preservation</a> and later consumption, possibly after further preparation. Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce iridescence, commonly thought to be due to spoilage but actually caused structural coloration and <a href="/wiki/Diffraction" title="Diffraction">diffraction</a> of the light. A common additive to processed meats, both for preservation and because it prevents discoloring, is <a href="/wiki/Sodium_nitrite" title="Sodium nitrite">sodium nitrite</a>, which, however, is also a source of health concerns, because it may form <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carcinogenic" title="Carcinogenic">carcinogenic</a> <a href="/wiki/Nitrosamine" title="Nitrosamine">nitrosamines</a> when heated.</p>

<p>Meat is generally eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or fish (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tartare" title="Tartare">tartare</a>). <a href="/wiki/Steak_tartare" title="Steak tartare">Steak tartare</a> is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Raw_food" title="Raw food">raw</a> <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a> or <a href="/wiki/Horse_meat" title="Horse meat">horse meat</a>.

<p>A study of 400,000 subjects conducted by the <a href="/wiki/European_Prospective_Investigation_into_Cancer_and_Nutrition" title="European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition">European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition</a> and published in 2013 showed "a moderate positive association between processed meat consumption and mortality, in particular due to cardiovascular diseases, but also to cancer."</p>
<p>A 1999 <a href="/wiki/Meta-analysis" title="Meta-analysis">metastudy</a> combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mortality_ratio" title="Mortality ratio">mortality ratios</a>, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00.</p>
<p>In response to changing prices as well as health concerns about saturated fat and cholesterol, consumers have altered their consumption of various meats. A USDA report points out that consumption of beef in the United States between 1970–1974 and 1990–1994 dropped by 21%, while consumption of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicken_(food)" title="Chicken (food)">chicken</a> increased by 90%. During the same period of time, the price of chicken dropped by 14% relative to the price of beef. In 1995 and 1996, beef consumption increased due to higher supplies and lower prices.</p>
<p>The <i>2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i> asked men and teenage boys to increase their consumption of vegetables or other underconsumed foods because they eat too much protein.</p>
<p>Various toxic compounds can contaminate meat, including <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metals" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mycotoxins" title="Mycotoxins">mycotoxins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticide</a> residues, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyaromatic_hydrocarbons" title="Polyaromatic hydrocarbons">polyaromatic hydrocarbons</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Contamination">Contamination</span></h3>

Toxins may be introduced to meat as part of animal feed, as veterinary drug residues, or during processing and cooking.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cancer">Cancer</span></h3>
<p>Carcinogenesis is the main long-term toxic response of consuming meat and meat byproducts.</p>
<p>Health concerns have been raised about the consumption of meat increasing the risk of cancer. In particular, red meat and processed meat were found to be associated with higher risk of cancers of the <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" title="Lung cancer">lung</a>, esophagus, liver, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Colon_cancer" title="Colon cancer">colon</a>, among others — although also a reduced risk for some minor type of cancers.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer" title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) is the specialized cancer agency of the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO). IARC classified processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) as, "<i>carcinogenic to humans</i> (Group 1), based on <i>sufficient evidence</i> in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer." IARC also classified red meat as "<i>probably carcinogenic to humans</i> (Group 2A), based on <i>limited evidence</i> that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in humans and <i>strong</i> mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect."</p>
<p>Another study found an increase risk of pancreatic cancer for red meat and pork. That study noted that, "findings suggest that intakes of red meat and processed meat are positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk and thus are potential target factors for disease prevention. [...] Future analyses of meat and pancreatic cancer risk should focus on meat preparation methods and related carcinogens." </p>
<p>That study also suggests that fat and saturated fat are not likely contributors to pancreatic cancer. Animal fat, particularly from ruminants, tends to have a higher percentage of <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fat</a> vs. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to vegetable fats, with the exception of some tropical plant fats; consumption of which has been correlated with various health problems. The saturated fat found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Colon_cancer" title="Colon cancer">colon cancer</a>, although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to animal fat consumption.</p>
<p>Other research does not support significant links between meat consumption and various cancers. Key et al. found that "There were no significant differences between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer or all other causes combined." Truswell reviewed numerous studies, concluding that the relationship of colorectal cancer with meat consumption appeared weaker than the "probable" status it had been given by the World Cancer Research Foundation in 1997. A study by Chao et al. (2005) found an apparent association of colorectal cancer with red meat consumption after adjustment for age and energy intake. However, after further adjustment for body mass index, cigarette smoking and other covariates, no association with red meat consumption was found. Alex' ander conducted a meta-analysis which found no association of colorectal cancer with consumption of animal fat or protein. Based on European data (EPIC-Oxford study), Key et al. found that incidence of colorectal cancer was somewhat lower among meat eaters than among vegetarians. However, they concluded that 'the study is not large enough to exclude small or moderate differences for specific causes of death, and more research on this topic is required'. A study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found that association between esophageal cancer risk and total and processed meat intake was not statistically significant. Another recent study of EPIC  found a significant correlation between eating ' processed meat and cardiovascular diseases...also to cancer. In this population, reduction of processed meat consumption to less than 20 g/day would prevent more than 3% of all deaths.'</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heart_disease">Heart disease</span></h3>
<p>The correlation of consumption to increased risk of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heart_disease" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a> is controversial. Some studies fail to find a link between red meat consumption and heart disease (although the same study found statistically significant correlation between the consumption of processed meat and coronary heart disease), while another study, a survey, conducted in 1960, of 25,153 California Seventh-Day Adventists, found that the risk of heart disease is three times greater for 45- to 64-year-old men who eat meat daily, versus those who did not eat meat. A major Harvard University study  in 2010 involving over one million people who ate meat found that only processed meat had an adverse risk in relation to coronary heart disease. The study suggests that eating 50 g (less than 2oz) of processed meat per day increases risk of coronary heart disease by 42%, and diabetes by 19%. Equivalent levels of fat, including saturated fats, in unprocessed meat (even when eating twice as much per day) did not show any deleterious effects, leading the researchers to suggest that "differences in salt and preservatives, rather than fats, might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats, but not with unprocessed red meats."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obesity">Obesity</span></h3>
<p>The EPIC-PANACEA study, published in 2010 in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> closely tracked 373,803 people over a period of 8 years across 10 countries. It concluded that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain in men and women. The <a href="/wiki/National_Cattlemen%27s_Beef_Association" title="National Cattlemen's Beef Association">National Cattlemen's Beef Association</a> countered by stating that meat consumption may not be associated with fat gain. In response, the authors of the original study controlled for just abdominal fat across a sample of 91,214 people and found that even when controlling for calories and lifestyle factors, meat consumption is linked with obesity. Additional studies and reviews have confirmed the finding that greater meat consumption is positively linked with greater weight gain even when controlling for calories, and lifestyle factors.</p>

<p>A 2011 study by the <a href="/wiki/Translational_Genomics_Research_Institute" title="Translational Genomics Research Institute">Translational Genomics Research Institute</a> showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and <a href="/wiki/Poultry" title="Poultry">poultry</a> in U.S. grocery stores were contaminated with <i><a href="/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus" title="Staphylococcus aureus">S. aureus</a></i>, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooking">Cooking</span></h3>
<p>Meat can transmit certain <a href="/wiki/Disease" title="Disease">diseases</a>, but complete cooking and avoiding recontamination reduces this possibility.</p>
<p>Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking muscle meat creates <a href="/wiki/Heterocyclic_amine" title="Heterocyclic amine">heterocyclic amines</a> (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute published results of a study which found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done. While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the <a href="/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute" title="National Cancer Institute">National Cancer Institute</a> states that cooking meat below 212 <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" title="Fahrenheit">°F</a> (100 <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">°C</a>) creates "negligible amounts" of HCAs. Also, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microwaving" title="Microwaving">microwaving</a> meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nitrosamine" title="Nitrosamine">Nitrosamines</a>, present in processed and cooked foods, have been noted as being carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer. Also, toxic compounds called PAHs, or <a href="/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon" title="Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</a>, present in processed, smoked and cooked foods, are known to be carcinogenic.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Meat_in_society">Meat in society</span></h2>
<p>Meat is part of the human diet in most cultures, where it often has symbolic meaning and important social functions. Many people, however, choose not to eat meat (this is referred to as <a href="/wiki/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>) or any food made from animals (<a href="/wiki/Veganism" title="Veganism">veganism</a>). The reasons for not eating all or some meat may include ethical objections to killing animals for food, health concerns, environmental concerns or religious <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dietary_laws" title="Dietary laws">dietary laws</a>.</p>

<p>Ethical issues regarding the consumption of meat include objecting to the act of killing animals or to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intensive_agriculture" title="Intensive agriculture">agricultural practices</a> used in meat production. Reasons for objecting to killing animals for consumption may include <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_ethics" title="Environmental ethics">environmental ethics</a>, or an aversion to inflicting <a href="/wiki/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a> or harm on other <a href="/wiki/Sentience" title="Sentience">sentient creatures</a>. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals (such as cows, pigs, cats, dogs, horses, or rabbits) due to cultural or religious traditions.</p>
<p>Some people eat only the flesh of animals that they believe have not been mistreated, and abstain from the flesh of animals raised in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Factory_farming" title="Factory farming">factory farms</a> or else abstain from particular products, such as <a href="/wiki/Foie_gras" title="Foie gras">foie gras</a> and <a href="/wiki/Veal" title="Veal">veal</a>. Some people also abstain from milk and its derivatives for ethical reasons, because the production of veal is a byproduct of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dairy_industry" title="Dairy industry">dairy industry</a>. The ethical issues with intensive agriculture have to do with the concentration of animals, animal waste, and the potential for dead animals in a small space.</p>
<p>Some techniques of intensive agriculture may be cruel to animals: foie gras is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_product" title="Food product">food product</a> made from the <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> of <a href="/wiki/Domestic_duck" title="Domestic duck">ducks</a> or <a href="/wiki/Domestic_goose" title="Domestic goose">geese</a> that have been <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Force_feeding" title="Force feeding">force fed</a> corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.</p>

<p>The religion of <a href="/wiki/Jainism" title="Jainism">Jainism</a> has always opposed eating meat, and there are also <a href="/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism" title="Buddhist vegetarianism">schools of Buddhism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hinduism#Vegetarian_Hindus" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> that condemn the eating of meat. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> dietary rules (<i><a href="/wiki/Kashrut" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a></i>) allow certain (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kosher" title="Kosher">kosher</a></i>) meat and forbid other (<i><a href="/wiki/Treif" title="Treif">treif</a></i>).
