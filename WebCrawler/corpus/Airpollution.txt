<p>An air pollutant is a substance in the air that can have adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem. The substance can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made. Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are usually produced from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other examples include <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> gas from motor vehicle exhaust, or the <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ground_level_ozone" title="Ground level ozone">Ground level ozone</a> is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.</p>




<p>Major primary pollutants produced by human activity include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Sulfur_oxide" title="Sulfur oxide">Sulfur oxides</a> (SO<sub>x</sub>) - particularly sulfur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula SO<sub>2</sub>. SO<sub>2</sub> is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub>, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO<sub>2</sub>, forms H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and thus <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>.[2] This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" title="Nitrogen oxide">Nitrogen oxides</a> (NO<sub>x</sub>) - Nitrogen oxides, particularly <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" title="Nitrogen dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a>, are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also produced during <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thunderstorms" title="Thunderstorms">thunderstorms</a> by <a href="/wiki/Electric_discharge" title="Electric discharge">electric discharge</a>. They can be seen as a brown <a href="/wiki/Haze" title="Haze">haze</a> dome above or a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plume_(hydrodynamics)" title="Plume (hydrodynamics)">plume</a> downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO<sub>2</sub>. It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">Carbon monoxide</a> (CO) - CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic yet non-irritating gas. It is a product by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incomplete_combustion" title="Incomplete combustion">incomplete combustion</a> of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust is a major source of carbon monoxide.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">Volatile organic compounds</a> (VOC) - VOCs are a well-known outdoor air pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Particulates" title="Particulates">Particulates</a>, alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, altered lung function and lung cancer.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)#Persistent_radicals" title="Radical (chemistry)">Persistent free radicals</a> connected to airborne fine particles are linked to cardiopulmonary disease.</li>
<li>Toxic <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metals</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, especially their compounds.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbons" title="Chlorofluorocarbons">Chlorofluorocarbons</a> (CFCs) - harmful to the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>; emitted from products are currently banned from use. These are gases which are released from air conditioners, refrigerators, aerosol sprays, etc. CFC's on being released into the air rises to <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Here they come in contact with other gases and damage the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>. This allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's surface. This can lead to skin cancer, disease to eye and can even cause damage to plants.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">Ammonia</a> (NH<sub>3</sub>) - emitted from agricultural processes. Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH<sub>3</sub>. It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous. In the atmosphere, ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Odor" title="Odor">Odours</a> — such as from garbage, sewage, and industrial processes</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactive_pollutants" title="Radioactive pollutants">Radioactive pollutants</a> - produced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_explosions" title="Nuclear explosions">nuclear explosions</a>, nuclear events, war <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Explosives" title="Explosives">explosives</a>, and natural processes such as the <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> of <a href="/wiki/Radon" title="Radon">radon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary pollutants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Particulates created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in photochemical smog. <a href="/wiki/Smog" title="Smog">Smog</a> is a kind of air pollution. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ground_level_ozone" title="Ground level ozone">Ground level ozone</a> (O<sub>3</sub>) formed from NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a key constituent of the troposphere. It is also an important constituent of certain regions of the stratosphere commonly known as the Ozone layer. Photochemical and chemical reactions involving it drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere by day and by night. At abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities (largely the combustion of fossil fuel), it is a pollutant, and a constituent of smog.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Peroxyacetyl_nitrate" title="Peroxyacetyl nitrate">Peroxyacetyl nitrate</a> (PAN) - similarly formed from NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor air pollutants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large number of minor <a href="/wiki/Category:Hazardous_air_pollutants" title="Category:Hazardous air pollutants">hazardous air pollutants</a>. Some of these are regulated in USA under the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)" title="Clean Air Act (United States)">Clean Air Act</a> and in Europe under the Air Framework Directive</li>
<li>A variety of <a href="/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant" title="Persistent organic pollutant">persistent organic pollutants</a>, which can attach to particulates</li>
</ul>
<p>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the environment, to be capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potentially significant impacts on human health and the environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sources">Sources</span></h3>

<p>There are various locations, activities or factors which are responsible for releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. These sources can be classified into two major categories.</p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic (man-made) sources:</b></p>

<p>These are mostly related to the burning of multiple types of fuel.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stationary sources</b> include smoke stacks of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_plant" title="Power plant">power plants</a>, manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung.</li>
<li><b>Mobile sources</b> include <a href="/wiki/Roadway_air_dispersion_modeling" title="Roadway air dispersion modeling">motor vehicles</a>, marine vessels, and aircraft.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Controlled_burn" title="Controlled burn">Controlled burn</a></b> practices in agriculture and forest management. Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest.</li>
<li><b>Fumes</b> from <a href="/wiki/Paint" title="Paint">paint</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hair_spray" title="Hair spray">hair spray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Varnish" title="Varnish">varnish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aerosol_spray" title="Aerosol spray">aerosol sprays</a> and other solvents</li>
<li><b>Waste deposition</b> in <a href="/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a>, which generate <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. Methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is also an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asphyxiant" title="Asphyxiant">asphyxiant</a> and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Natural sources:</b></p>

Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive <a href="/wiki/Noble_gas" title="Noble gas">noble gas</a> that is formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard.

<li>Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">Volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants. Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than the low-impact tree species.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emission_factors">Emission factors</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/AP_42_Compilation_of_Air_Pollutant_Emission_Factors" title="AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors">AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors</a></div>

<p>Air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that attempt to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonne</a> of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.</p>
<p>There are 12 compounds in the list of <a href="/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant" title="Persistent organic pollutant">persistent organic pollutants</a>. Dioxins and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics, like open burning of plastics. These compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a multitude of industrial sources. The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and many other countries have published similar compilations, as well as the <a href="/wiki/European_Environment_Agency" title="European Environment Agency">European Environment Agency</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Exposure">Exposure</span></h2>
<p>Air pollution risk is a function of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Indoor_air_quality_.28IAQ.29">Indoor air quality (IAQ)</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Indoor_air_quality" title="Indoor air quality">Indoor air quality</a></div>

<p>A lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time. Radon (Rn) gas, a <a href="/wiki/Carcinogen" title="Carcinogen">carcinogen</a>, is exuded from the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. Building materials including <a href="/wiki/Carpet" title="Carpet">carpeting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plywood" title="Plywood">plywood</a> emit <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> (H<sub>2</sub>CO) gas. Paint and solvents give off <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) as they dry. <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">Lead</a> paint can degenerate into <a href="/wiki/Dust" title="Dust">dust</a> and be inhaled. Intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of <a href="/wiki/Air_freshener" title="Air freshener">air fresheners</a>, <a href="/wiki/Incense" title="Incense">incense</a>, and other scented items. Controlled wood fires in stoves and <a href="/wiki/Fireplace" title="Fireplace">fireplaces</a> can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air, inside and out. Indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a> and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a> indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent. Chronic <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning" title="Carbon monoxide poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> can result even from poorly-adjusted <a href="/wiki/Pilot_light" title="Pilot light">pilot lights</a>. Traps are built into all domestic <a href="/wiki/Plumbing" title="Plumbing">plumbing</a> to keep sewer gas and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a>, out of interiors. Clothing emits <a href="/wiki/Tetrachloroethylene" title="Tetrachloroethylene">tetrachloroethylene</a>, or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after <a href="/wiki/Dry_cleaning" title="Dry cleaning">dry cleaning</a>.</p>
<p>Though its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of <a href="/wiki/Asbestos" title="Asbestos">asbestos</a> in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. <a href="/wiki/Asbestosis" title="Asbestosis">Asbestosis</a> is a chronic <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammatory</a> medical condition affecting the tissue of the <a href="/wiki/Lung" title="Lung">lungs</a>. It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dyspnea" title="Dyspnea">dyspnea</a> (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>. As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the <a class="external text" href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123072/AQG2ndEd_6_2_asbestos.PDF" rel="nofollow">World Health Organisation (WHO)</a>, these may defined as; <a href="/wiki/Asbestosis" title="Asbestosis">asbestosis</a>, <i>lung cancer</i>, and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peritoneal_Mesothelioma" title="Peritoneal Mesothelioma">Peritoneal Mesothelioma</a></i> (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos).</p>
<p>Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. <a href="/wiki/Pet" title="Pet">Pets</a> produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, <a href="/wiki/House_dust_mite" title="House dust mite">dust mites</a> in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, <a href="/wiki/Mold" title="Mold">mold</a> forms on walls and generates <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mycotoxins" title="Mycotoxins">mycotoxins</a> and spores, <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioning" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a> systems can incubate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legionellosis" title="Legionellosis">Legionnaires' disease</a> and mold, and <a href="/wiki/Houseplant" title="Houseplant">houseplants</a>, soil and surrounding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gardens" title="Gardens">gardens</a> can produce <a href="/wiki/Pollen" title="Pollen">pollen</a>, dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Neuroplastic_effects_of_pollution" title="Neuroplastic effects of pollution">Neuroplastic effects of pollution</a></div>
<p>Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of <a href="/wiki/List_of_pollution-related_diseases" title="List of pollution-related diseases">pollution-related diseases</a> and health conditions including respiratory infections, heart disease, <a href="/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease" title="Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</a>, stroke and lung cancer. The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, <a href="/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics. The most common sources of air pollution include particulates, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. Children aged less than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mortality">Mortality</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide. India has the highest death rate due to air pollution. India also has more deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the World Health Organization. In December 2013 air pollution was estimated to kill 500,000 people in China each year. There is a positive correlation between <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>-related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>Annual premature European deaths caused by air pollution are estimated at 430,000. An important cause of these deaths is nitrogen dioxide and other nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by road vehicles. Across the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, air pollution is estimated to reduce <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> by almost nine months. Causes of deaths include <a href="/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">strokes</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heart_disease" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a>, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">US EPA</a> estimates that a proposed set of changes in <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a> technology (<i>Tier 2</i>) could result in 12,000 fewer <i>premature mortalities</i>, 15,000 fewer <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</a>, 6,000 fewer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emergency_room" title="Emergency room">emergency room</a> visits by children with asthma, and 8,900 fewer respiratory-related hospital admissions each year in the United States.</p>
<p>The US EPA has estimated that limiting ground-level ozone concentration to 65 parts per billion, would avert 1,700 to 5,100 premature deaths nationwide in 2020 compared with the 75-ppb standard. The agency projected the more protective standard would also prevent an additional 26,000 cases of aggravated asthma, and more than a million cases of missed work or school. Following this assessment, the EPA acted to protect public health by lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion (ppb).</p>
<p>A new economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air pollution in the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Basin" title="Los Angeles Basin">Los Angeles Basin</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley" title="San Joaquin Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a> of Southern California shows that more than 3,800 people die prematurely (approximately 14 years earlier than normal) each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards. The number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area, which average fewer than 2,000 per year.</p>
<p>Diesel exhaust (DE) is a major contributor to combustion-derived particulate matter air pollution. In several human experimental studies, using a well-validated exposure chamber setup, DE has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation.</p>
<p>The mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are uncertain, but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cardiovascular_disease">Cardiovascular disease</span></h3>
<p>A 2007 review of evidence found ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor correlating with increased total mortality from cardiovascular events (range: 12% to 14% per 10 microg/m increase).</p>
<p>Air pollution is also emerging as a risk factor for stroke, particularly in developing countries where pollutant levels are highest. A 2007 study found that in women, air pollution is not associated with hemorrhagic but with ischemic stroke. Air pollution was also found to be associated with increased incidence and mortality from coronary stroke in a cohort study in 2011. Associations are believed to be causal and effects may be mediated by vasoconstriction, low-grade inflammation and <a href="/wiki/Atherosclerosis" title="Atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> Other mechanisms such as autonomic nervous system imbalance have also been suggested. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lung_disease">Lung disease</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease" title="Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (COPD) includes diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and COPD from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Additionally, air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and COPD.</p>
<p>A study conducted in 1960-1961 in the wake of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Smog" title="Great Smog">Great Smog</a> of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FEV1" title="FEV1">FEV<sub>1</sub></a> and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences.</p>
<p>It is believed that much like <a href="/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis" title="Cystic fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer <a href="/wiki/Mucus" title="Mucus">mucus</a> hypersecretion, lower levels of lung function, and more self-diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cancer">Cancer</span></h3>

<p>A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes --- increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO<sub>2</sub> increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions. Another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas.</p>
<p>In 2011, a large Danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung cancer for patients who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations. In this study, the association was higher for non-smokers than smokers. An additional Danish study, also in 2011, likewise noted evidence of possible associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer, including cervical cancer and brain cancer.</p>
<p>In December 2015, medical scientists reported that <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancer</a> is overwhelmingly a result of <a href="/wiki/Environmental_factor" title="Environmental factor">environmental factors</a>, and not largely down to bad luck. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, minimizing alcohol and eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>In the United States, despite the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)" title="Clean Air Act (United States)">Clean Air Act</a> in 1970, in 2002 at least 146 million Americans were living in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-Attainment_Area" title="Non-Attainment Area">non-attainment areas</a>—regions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Clean.22_areas">"Clean" areas</span></h3>
<p>Even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution, public health effects can be significant and costly, since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants. A 2005 scientific study for the British Columbia Lung Association showed that a small improvement in air quality (1% reduction of ambient PM2.5 and ozone concentrations) would produce $29 million in annual savings in the <a href="/wiki/Metro_Vancouver" title="Metro Vancouver">Metro Vancouver</a> region in 2010. This finding is based on health valuation of lethal (death) and sub-lethal (illness) affects.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Central_nervous_system">Central nervous system</span></h3>
<p>Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the <a href="/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">central nervous system</a>.</p>
<p>In a June 2014 study conducted by researchers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Rochester" title="University of Rochester">University of Rochester</a> Medical Center, published in the journal <a href="/wiki/Environmental_Health_Perspectives" title="Environmental Health Perspectives">Environmental Health Perspectives</a>, it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as <a href="/wiki/Autism" title="Autism">autism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. The study also shows that air pollution also affected short-term memory, learning ability, and impulsivity. Lead researcher Professor Deborah Cory-Slechta said that "When we looked closely at the ventricles, we could see that the white matter that normally surrounds them hadn't fully developed. It appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing, and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in autism, as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders." Air pollution has a more significant negative effect on males than on females.</p>
<p>In 2015, experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic (situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in "conventional" and "green" buildings, as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either <a href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound" title="Volatile organic compound">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) or <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, while keeping other factors constant. The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Agricultural_effects">Agricultural effects</span></h2>
<p>In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution by <a href="/wiki/Black_carbon" title="Black carbon">black carbon</a> and ground level ozone had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_effects">Economic effects</span></h2>
<p>Air pollution costs the world economy $5 trillion per year as a result of productivity losses and degraded quality of life, according to a joint study by the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation" title="Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> (IHME) at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Washington" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a> These productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. One out of ten deaths in 2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse. The problem is even more acute in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_world" title="Developing world">developing world</a>. "Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries." The report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution, including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report, and thus the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than $5 trillion.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_disasters">Historical disasters</span></h2>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternatives_to_pollution">Alternatives to pollution</span></h2>
<p>There are now practical alternatives to the three principal causes of air pollution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ground_source_heat_pumps" title="Ground source heat pumps">ground source heat pumps</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage" title="Seasonal thermal energy storage">seasonal thermal energy storage</a>.</li>
<li>Electric power generation from burning fossil fuels can be replaced by power generation from nuclear and renewables.</li>
<li>Motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels, a key factor in urban air pollution, can be replaced by electric vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reduction_efforts">Reduction efforts</span></h2>
<p>There are various air pollution control technologies and strategies available to reduce air pollution. At its most basic level, <a href="/wiki/Land-use_planning" title="Land-use planning">land-use planning</a> is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. In most developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population, as well as to protect the environment.</p>
<p>Because a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>, the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydro_power" title="Hydro power">hydro power</a> which don't cause air pollution. Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations), expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as <a href="/wiki/String_trimmer" title="String trimmer">string trimmers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chainsaw" title="Chainsaw">chainsaws</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Snowmobiles" title="Snowmobiles">snowmobiles</a>), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle" title="Hybrid vehicle">hybrid vehicles</a>), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to <a href="/wiki/Electric_vehicle" title="Electric vehicle">electric vehicles</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Titanium_dioxide" title="Titanium dioxide">Titanium dioxide</a> has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution. <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a> light will release free electrons from material, thereby creating free radicals, which break up VOCs and NOx gases.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulations">Regulations</span></h2>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Air_quality_law" title="Air quality law">Air quality law</a></div>
<p>In general, there are two types of air quality standards. The first class of standards (such as the U.S. <a href="/wiki/National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards" title="National Ambient Air Quality Standards">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a> and E.U. <a class="external text" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/directive.htm" rel="nofollow">Air Quality Directive</a>) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_Quality_Index" title="Air Quality Index">Air Quality Index</a>) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h3>
<p>In Canada, air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the <a href="/wiki/Air_Quality_Health_Index_(Canada)" title="Air Quality Health Index (Canada)">Air Quality Health Index</a> or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution.</p>
<p>The Air Quality Health Index or "AQHI" is a federal program jointly coordinated by <a href="/wiki/Health_Canada" title="Health Canada">Health Canada</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environment_Canada" title="Environment Canada">Environment Canada</a>. However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.</p>


<p>As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as 'low', 'moderate', 'high' or 'very high', and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.</p>

<p>The measurement is based on the observed relationship of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ground-level Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and particulates (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) with mortality, from an analysis of several Canadian cities. Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems.</p>
<p>When developing the AQHI, Health Canada's original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: particulates, <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" title="Nitrogen dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a> (NO2), as well as <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> (SO<sub>2</sub>), and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation.</p>
<p>The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, <a href="/wiki/Pollen" title="Pollen">pollen</a>, dust, heat or humidity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Germany">Germany</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/TA_Luft" title="TA Luft">TA Luft</a> is the German air quality regulation.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hotspots">Hotspots</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic_Hotspots" title="Toxic Hotspots">Toxic Hotspots</a></div>
<p>Air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects. They are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may be a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.</p>
<p>While air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of <a href="/wiki/Social_vulnerability" title="Social vulnerability">social vulnerability</a>, including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.</p>
<p>Studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities. Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than whites and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones. Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the US South and metropolitan areas of the US West. Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cities">Cities</span></h2>



<p>Air pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas, especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent. However, even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution, with <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> being two examples. Between 2002 and 2011 the incidence of lung cancer in <a href="/wiki/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> near doubled. While smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in China, the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising. Another project focusing on the effects on <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution_on_vegetation" title="Air pollution on vegetation">pollution in vegetation</a> has been researched by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Sheffield" title="University of Sheffield">local university in Sheffield, UK</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="National-scale_air_toxics_assessments_1995-2005">National-scale air toxics assessments 1995-2005</span></h2>
<p>The national-scale air toxics assessment(NATA) is an evaluation of air toxics by the U.S. EPA. EPA has furnished four assessments that characterize nationwide chronic cancer risk estimates and noncancer hazards from inhaling air toxics. The lates was from 2005, and made publicly available in early 2011.</p>
<p>"EPA developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study, in order to gain a better understanding of the risks. NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources, but rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk. This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest. Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter. Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Governing_urban_air_pollution">Governing urban air pollution</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Member_states" title="Member states">member states</a> can "set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment . . . and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory".</p>
<p>On 25 July 2008 in the case Dieter Janecek v Freistaat Bayern CURIA, the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a> ruled that under this directive citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values.</p>
<p>This important <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Case_law" title="Case law">case law</a> appears to confirm the role of the EC as centralised regulator to European nation-states as regards air pollution control. It places a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supranational" title="Supranational">supranational</a> legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution, furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> (EC) threatened the UK with legal action against the successive breaching of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PM10" title="PM10">PM10</a> limit values. The UK government has identified that if fines are imposed, they could cost the nation upwards of £300 million per year.</p>
<p>In March 2011, the <a href="/wiki/Greater_London_Built-up_Area" title="Greater London Built-up Area">Greater London Built-up Area</a> remains the only UK region in breach of the EC's limit values, and has been given 3 months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the EU Air Quality Directive. The City of London has dangerous levels of PM10 concentrations, estimated to cause 3000 deaths per year within the city. As well as the threat of EU fines, in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congestion_charge" title="Congestion charge">congestion charge</a> zone, which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels.</p>
<p>In response to these charges, <a href="/wiki/Boris_Johnson" title="Boris Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_London" title="Mayor of London">Mayor of London</a>, has criticised the current need for European cities to communicate with Europe through their nation state's <a href="/wiki/Central_government" title="Central government">central government</a>, arguing that in future "A great city like London" should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the European Commission regarding its air quality action plan.</p>
<p>This can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks, for example through transnational relations. Transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations, allowing sub-national actors including cities and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regions" title="Regions">regions</a> to partake in air pollution control as independent actors.</p>
<p>Particularly promising at present are global city partnerships. These can be built into networks, for example the <a href="/wiki/C40_Cities_Climate_Leadership_Group" title="C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group">C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group</a>, of which London is a member. The C40 is a public 'non-state' network of the world's leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions. The C40 has been identified as 'governance from the middle' and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy. It has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities "exchange information, learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions". A criticism of the C40 network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling" title="Atmospheric dispersion modeling">Atmospheric dispersion modeling</a></div>

<p>The basic technology for analyzing air pollution is through the use of a variety of <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_model" title="Mathematical model">mathematical models</a> for predicting the transport of air pollutants in the lower atmosphere. The principal methodologies are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollution_dispersion_terminology#Air_pollutant_emission" title="Air pollution dispersion terminology">Point source</a> dispersion, used for industrial sources</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollution_dispersion_terminology#Air_pollutant_emission" title="Air pollution dispersion terminology">Line source</a> dispersion, used for airport and <a href="/wiki/Roadway_air_dispersion_modeling" title="Roadway air dispersion modeling">roadway air dispersion modeling</a></li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollution_dispersion_terminology#Air_pollutant_emission" title="Air pollution dispersion terminology">Area source</a> dispersion, used for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forest_fire" title="Forest fire">forest fires</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Duststorm" title="Duststorm">duststorms</a></li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photochemical" title="Photochemical">Photochemical</a> models, used to analyze reactive pollutants that form smog</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Point_source" title="Point source">point source</a> problem is the best understood, since it involves simpler mathematics and has been studied for a long period of time, dating back to about the year 1900. It uses a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gaussian" title="Gaussian">Gaussian</a> dispersion model for continuous buoyant pollution plumes to predict the air pollution <a href="/wiki/Contour_line" title="Contour line">isopleths</a>, with consideration given to wind velocity, stack height, emission rate and stability class (a measure of atmospheric <a href="/wiki/Turbulence" title="Turbulence">turbulence</a>). This model has been extensively validated and calibrated with experimental data for all sorts of atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roadway_air_dispersion_model" title="Roadway air dispersion model">roadway air dispersion model</a> was developed starting in the late 1950s and early 1960s in response to requirements of the <a href="/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act" title="National Environmental Policy Act">National Environmental Policy Act</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Transportation" title="U.S. Department of Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> (then known as the Federal Highway Administration) to understand impacts of proposed new highways upon air quality, especially in urban areas. Several research groups were active in this model development, among which were: the Environmental Research and Technology (ERT) group in <a href="/wiki/Lexington,_Massachusetts" title="Lexington, Massachusetts">Lexington</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, the ESL Inc. group in <a href="/wiki/Sunnyvale,_California" title="Sunnyvale, California">Sunnyvale</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and the <a href="/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board" title="California Air Resources Board">California Air Resources Board</a> group in <a href="/wiki/Sacramento,_California" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a>, California. The research of the ESL group received a boost with a contract award from the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> to validate a line source model using <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride" title="Sulfur hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Organic_molecular_tracers" title="Organic molecular tracers">tracer</a> gas. This program was successful in validating the line source model developed by ESL Inc. Some of the earliest uses of the model were in court cases involving highway air pollution; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia" title="Arlington, Virginia">Arlington</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> portion of <a href="/wiki/Interstate_66" title="Interstate 66">Interstate 66</a> and the <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Turnpike" title="New Jersey Turnpike">New Jersey Turnpike</a> widening project through <a href="/wiki/East_Brunswick,_New_Jersey" title="East Brunswick, New Jersey">East Brunswick</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p>Area source models were developed in 1971 through 1974 by the ERT and ESL groups, but addressed a smaller fraction of total air pollution emissions, so that their use and need was not as widespread as the line source model, which enjoyed hundreds of different applications as early as the 1970s. Similarly photochemical models were developed primarily in the 1960s and 70s, but their use was more specialized and for regional needs, such as understanding smog formation in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California.</p>
