<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Established in 1974, NREL began operating in 1977 as the <b>Solar Energy Research Institute</b>. Under the <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Jimmy_Carter" title="Presidency of Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter administration</a>, it was the recipient of a large budget and its activities went beyond research and development in solar energy as it tried to popularize knowledge about already existing technologies, like passive solar, amongst the population. During the <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan" title="Presidency of Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan administration</a>, the institute's budget was cut by some 90%; many employees 'reduced in force' and the laboratory's activities were reduced to R&amp;D. In later years, renewed interest in the energy problem improved the institute's position, but funding has fluctuated. In 2006 funding had dropped to the point that NREL was forced to lay off 32 workers, and in 2011 anticipated congressional budget shortfalls led to a voluntary buyout program for 100 to 150 staff reductions.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1977 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, it has been operated under contract by <a href="/wiki/MRIGlobal" title="MRIGlobal">MRIGlobal</a>. In September 1991, the NREL was designated a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy_National_Laboratories" title="United States Department of Energy National Laboratories">national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy</a> (DOE) by President George H.W. Bush and its name was changed to NREL. Currently, NREL is managed for the DOE by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC. The Alliance was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between <a href="/wiki/MRIGlobal" title="MRIGlobal">MRIGlobal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute" title="Battelle Memorial Institute">Battelle</a>. Dr. Dan E. Arvizu became NREL's eighth Laboratory Director in January 2005, and currently serves as both the director of the lab and president of the Alliance.</p>
<p>NREL's areas of research and development expertise are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_electricity" title="Renewable electricity">renewable electricity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Renewable_fuels" title="Renewable fuels">renewable fuels</a>, integrated energy systems, and strategic energy analysis.</p>
<p>In 2011, NREL became the co-secretariat of the <a href="/wiki/Low_Emission_Development_Strategies_Global_Partnership_(LEDS_GP)" title="Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)">Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)</a> alongside the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_%26_Development_Knowledge_Network" title="Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network">Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network</a> (CDKN).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Commercialization_and_technology_transfer">Commercialization and technology transfer</span></h2>
<p>NREL works closely with a number of private partners to transfer technological developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the marketplace and social arena.</p>
<p>NREL's innovative technologies have been recognized with 57 R&amp;D 100 Awards. The engineering and science behind these technology transfer successes and awards demonstrates NREL's commitment to a sustainable energy future. The idea of technology transfer was added to the mission of NREL as a means of enhancing commercial impact and societal benefit, ultimately justifying the use of tax dollars to in part fund the projects in the lab.</p>
<p>As many of these technologies are young and often just emerging, NREL aims to reduce the risk of private sector investment and adoption of their developments. Three key pieces of federal legislation laid the policy framework to enact technology transfer: The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, The Bayh-Dole Act or The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980, and The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many of the deployed technologies help mitigate the oil dependence of the United States, reduce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> from <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> use, and maintain U.S. industry competitiveness. Deployment of technologies is accomplished by developing technology partnerships with private industry. NREL serves as a reduced-risk platform for research, and through partnerships those advances can effectively be translated into serving the interest of both the private sector and the public sector. The energy goals set by the DOE are at the forefront of the research done in the laboratory, and the research reflects the energy goals, which are designed with the interest of "U.S. industry competitiveness" in mind. The challenge to achieving these goals is investment security.</p>
<p>Part of the technology transfer process is to form partnerships that not only focus on financial security, but also to consider partners who have demonstrated core values that reflect the integrity to manage the introduction and assimilation of the technological developments. NREL focuses on the core values of the partnering entity, the willingness to set and meet timely goals, dedication to transparency, and a reciprocating intent to further development. Under these partnership agreements, NREL does not fund projects conducted by their private partners. NREL does provide funding opportunities through their competitively placed contracts. In order to form a Technology Partnership Agreement with NREL, there are essentially 11 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss the project proposal with the appropriate NREL technical contact</li>
<li>Determine if the project meets qualifications (separate checklist of criteria)</li>
<li>Determine agreement type
<ol>
<li>Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)</li>
<li>Work for others</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Develop statement of work</li>
<li>Provide draft agreement</li>
<li>Review and/or negotiate</li>
<li>Sign agreement</li>
<li>Review and approve</li>
<li>Send funds</li>
<li>Start work</li>
<li>Manage commitment</li>
</ol>
<p>The process is estimated to require 45 business days subject to negotiations. Technology Partnership Agreements provide only the technical services of NREL.</p>
<p>Moving further than Technology Partnership Agreements are Licensing Agreements and Nondisclosure Agreements. Licensing Agreements provide industry to market and commercialize technology developed by NREL. This type of agreement is available to any organization, regardless of size. A Nondisclosure Agreement is an agreement to implement confidentiality of information for a mutually beneficial collaboration in research and development.</p>
<p>Prior successes include the NREL and SkyFuel partnership in the next generation of solar parabolic troughs, and also the partnership between NREL scientists, Ampulse Corporation, and <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) to create a less expensive alternative to wafer crystalline silicon solar cells.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooperative_Research_and_Development_Agreement">Cooperative Research and Development Agreement</span></h3>
<p>A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is a partnership between NREL and an outside company. This type of agreement protects the intellectual property of both NREL and the outside company, and allows the investing company the right to exclusive field-of-use license for any inventions that come out of the CRADA. There are two types of CRADA's. A Shared-Resource CRADA is used to "develop, advance, or commercialize an NREL project, without money changing hands."</p>
<p>The development and progress of a Shared-Resource CRADA must fit within the scope of an existing NREL project already funded by the DOE. The second type of agreement is called a "Funds-In" CRADA. It allows for the partner to pay for some or all of NREL expenses under a project, but NREL does not supply funds to the partner. A specific example of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is between NREL, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Ampulse Corporation to develop a less expensive silicon solar cell. Funding came from both parties, and the resulting processes and investigations were carried out in cooperation between the three entities (two federal and one non-federal).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_for_others">Work for others</span></h3>
<p>NREL offers technical services to partners who require resources that are not available to them through the form of a Work-for-Others agreement. This agreement differs from CRADA's in that they are not for the purpose of performing joint research. The partner covers the entire cost of the project. There are four types of Work-for-Others agreements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interagency Agreement-Government (IAG): A partnership formed between the DOE and a second U.S. federal agency. The outside agency funds the project directly.</li>
<li>Funds-In Agreement (FIA): A non-federal entity funds the project and research conducted by NREL. In some occasions, the partner can obtain title to inventions.</li>
<li>Technical Services Agreement (TSA): A non-federal entity pays NREL for services related to an analytical problem. NREL provides consultation and basic technical assistance.</li>
<li>Analytical Services Agreement (ASA): This is a narrower, more specified version of a Technical Services Agreement. Non-federal sponsors pay for a specific analytical service performed by the lab in one of 13 different categories of testing/characterization services. It is a small-scale agreement, often dubbed a "shrink-wrap" agreement, has a maximum duration of 3 months and a maximum value of $25,000.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Technology_licensing">Technology licensing</span></h3>
<p>NREL offers licensing for many of its technologies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy development. Licensing of NREL's intellectual property is available to businesses of any size, from start-up to <a href="/wiki/Fortune_500" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a>. The available technologies fall under the categories of: renewable electricity conversion and delivery systems, renewable fuels formulation and delivery, efficient and integrated energy systems, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Strategic" title="Strategic">strategic</a> energy analysis. "NREL-developed technologies include vehicles and fuels, basic sciences, biomass, concentrating solar power, electric infrastructure systems, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cells, photovoltaics, and wind energy."</p>
<p>NREL has a list of 33 market summaries available for licensing, and the list includes information about the descriptions of the technologies, their benefits, potential applications, and their current stage in development. In addition to market summaries, NREL and the DOE hold 457 patents under the heading of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="National_Center_for_Photovoltaics">National Center for Photovoltaics</span></h2>

<p>Some of the areas of PV R&amp;D include the physical properties of PV panels, performance and reliability of PV, junction formation, and research into photo-electrochemical materials. NREL partners with both industry and academia to "investigate properties and operating mechanisms of cell materials and devices."</p>
<p>Through this research, NREL hopes to surpass current technologies in efficiency and cost-competitiveness and reach the overall goal of generating electricity at $0.06/<a href="/wiki/Kilowatt_hour" title="Kilowatt hour">kWh</a> for <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">grid</a>-tied PV systems.</p>
<p>NREL identifies the following as cornerstones to its PV R&amp;D program:the High-Performance Photovoltaics Project, the Thin-Film Partnership, and the PV Manufacturing R&amp;D Project.</p>
<p>The High-Performance Photovoltaics Project aims to double the conversion efficiency of solar PV panels by analyzing a broad set of complex technical issues. In doing so, they hope to create working prototypes of these high-efficiency PV panels.</p>
<p>The Thin Film Partnership Program at NREL coordinates national research teams of manufacturers, academics, and NREL scientists on a variety of subjects relating to thin-film PV. The research areas of the Thin Film Partnership Program include amorphous silicon (a-Si), copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2 or CIS) and, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium_telluride" title="Cadmium telluride">cadmium telluride</a> (CdTe), and module reliability.</p>
<p>NREL's PV Manufacturing Research and Development Project is an ongoing partnership between NREL and private sector solar manufacturing companies. It started in 1991 as the Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) project and was extended and renamed in 2001 due to its success as a project. The overall goal of research done under the PV Manufacturing R&amp;D Project is to help maintain a strong market position for US solar companies by researching ways to reduce costs to manufacturers and customers and improving the manufacturing process. It is estimated that the project has helped to reduce manufacturing cost for PV panels by 50%.</p>
<p>Examples of achievements under the PV Manufacturing Research and Development Project include the development of a manufacturing process that increase the production of silicon solar modules by 8% without increasing costs and the development of a new boron coating process that reduces solar costs over traditional processes.</p>
