<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>


<p>Beginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. A key legislative option to address this concern was the declaration of a national environmental policy. Advocates of this approach argued that without a specific policy, federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agency's mission. The statute that ultimately addressed this issue was the <a href="/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act" title="National Environmental Policy Act">National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</a> (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347). Senator <a href="/wiki/Henry_M._Jackson" title="Henry M. Jackson">Henry M. Jackson</a> proposed and helped write S 1075, the bill that eventually became the National Environmental Policy Act. The law was signed by President Nixon on January 1, 1970. NEPA was the first of several major environmental laws passed in the 1970s. It declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States" title="Executive Office of the President of the United States">Executive Office of the President</a>. To implement the national policy, NEPA required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. The "detailed statement" would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement (EIS).</p>

<p>In 1970, President Richard Nixon proposed an executive reorganization that would consolidate many of the federal government's environmental responsibilities under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency. That reorganization proposal was reviewed and passed by the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Staff recall that in the early days there was “an enormous sense of purpose and excitement” and the expectation that “there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country,” leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America’s environment. </p>
<p>For at least 10 years before NEPA was enacted, Congress debated issues that the act would ultimately address. The act was modeled on the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959, introduced by Senator <a href="/wiki/James_E._Murray" title="James E. Murray">James E. Murray</a> in the <a href="/wiki/86th_United_States_Congress" title="86th United States Congress">86th Congress</a>. That bill would have established an environmental advisory counsel in the office of the President, declared a national environmental policy, and required the preparation of an annual environmental report. In the years following the introduction of Senator Murray's bill, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses to perceived problems. In 1968, a joint House-Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (Senator Henry M. Jackson) and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics (Representative <a href="/wiki/George_Miller_(California_politician)" title="George Miller (California politician)">George Miller</a>) to discuss the need for and potential means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some Members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.</p>
<p>When EPA first began, the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad, and the agency’s first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, felt pressure to show a public that was deeply skeptical about government’s effectiveness that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution. </p>
<p>The EPA began regulating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a> (GHGs) from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)" title="Clean Air Act (United States)">Clean Air Act (CAA)</a> for the first time on January 2, 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to Section 202 of the CAA, and GHGs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of Part C of Title I of the Act. See the page <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regulation_of_Greenhouse_Gases_Under_the_Clean_Air_Act" title="Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Under the Clean Air Act">Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Under the Clean Air Act</a> for further information.</p>
<p>In May 2013, Congress renamed the EPA headquarters as the <a href="/wiki/William_Jefferson_Clinton_Federal_Building" title="William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building">William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building</a>, after former president <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that, in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning, Administrator William Ruckelshaus observed that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other programs would be unconnected, placed in “silos,” a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start. </p>

The fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicle's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(1970)" title="Clean Air Act (1970)">Clean Air Act</a> certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests.</p>
<p>The current testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used <a href="/wiki/Driving_cycle" title="Driving cycle">driving cycles</a> designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> during that era. Prior to 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test. In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka <a href="/wiki/UDDS" title="UDDS">Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule</a> or <a href="/wiki/UDDS" title="UDDS">UDDS</a>) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972 and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures to add a new higher speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports. The updated testing methodology was finalized in December, 2006 for implementation with model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.</p>
<p>In February 2005, the organization launched a program called "Your MPG" that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the EPA's fuel economy website and compare them with others and the original EPA test results.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the EPA actually conducts these tests on very few vehicles. "While the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck, van, car, and SUV, in reality, just 18 of the EPA's 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year, or roughly 15 percent of new models. As to that other 85 percent, the EPA takes automakers at their word—without any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate." Two-thirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are selected randomly, and the remaining third are tested for specific reasons.</p>
<p>Although originally created as a reference point for fossil fuelled vehicles, driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will do on a single charge.</p>

In certain cases, readings exceeding EPA MCL levels are deleted or not included despite mandatory reporting regulations. A draft of revised EPA regulations relaxes the regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water, stating that current standards are impractical to enforce. The EPA is recommending that intervention is not necessary until drinking water is contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter (the limit for short term exposure set by the International Atomic Energy Agency), which is 27,000 times the current EPA limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fiscal_mismanagement">Fiscal mismanagement</span></h3>
<p>EPA director Anne M. Gorsuch resigned under fire in 1983 during a scandal over mismanagement of a $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps. Gorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the <a href="/wiki/New_Federalism" title="New Federalism">New Federalism</a> approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states. She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating. <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">Environmentalists</a> contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the Agency.</p>
<p>In 1982 Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion toxic waste <a href="/wiki/Superfund" title="Superfund">Superfund</a> and demanded records from Gorsuch.

<p>The state of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars. EPA administrator <a href="/wiki/Stephen_L._Johnson" title="Stephen L. Johnson">Stephen L.

<p>In December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Libraries">Libraries</span></h3>
<p>In 2004, the Agency began a strategic planning exercise to develop plans for a more virtual approach to library services.

<p>In March 2005, nine states (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued the EPA. The EPA's inspector general had determined that the EPA's regulation of <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees. The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> which contradicted its position on mercury controls. The suit alleges that the EPA's rule allowing exemption from "maximum available control technology" was illegal, and additionally charged that the EPA's system of pollution credit trading allows power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions. Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations. Illinois's proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90% by 2009.</p>

About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.</p>
<p>EPA research has also been suppressed by career managers. Supervisors at EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about EPA's integrated risk information system, which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication, and the corresponding author, Ching-Hung Hsu, to leave EPA "because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing". EPA subjects employees who author scientific papers to <a href="/wiki/Prior_restraint" title="Prior restraint">prior restraint</a>, even if those papers are written on personal time. A $3 million mapping study on <a href="/wiki/Climate_Change_Science_Program#Coastal_sensitivity_to_sea_level_rise_.28SAP_4.1.29" title="Climate Change Science Program"><i>sea level rise</i></a> was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps. EPA employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing" title="Hydraulic fracturing">hydraulic fracturing</a> due to industry and governmental pressure, and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports.</p>
<p>In 2015, the <a href="/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office" title="Government Accountability Office">Government Accountability Office</a> stated that the EPA violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_justice">Environmental justice</span></h3>
<p>The EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environmental justice</a>.

In a March 2004 report, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Office_of_the_Inspector_General" title="Office of the Inspector General">inspector general</a> of the agency concluded that the EPA "has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements" for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies and activities towards environmental justice. Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's <a href="/wiki/Superfund" title="Superfund">Superfund</a> program, and that this situation was worsening.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Barriers_to_enforcing_environmental_justice">Barriers to enforcing environmental justice</span></h4>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Localization">Localization</span></h5>
<p>Many issues of environmental justice are localized, and are therefore hard to be addressed by federal agencies such as the EPA. Without significant media attention, political interest, or 'crisis' status, local issues are less likely to be addressed at the local or federal level. With a still developing sector of environmental justice under the EPA, small, local incidents are unlikely to be solved compared to larger, well publicized incidents.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Conflicting_political_powers">Conflicting political powers</span></h5>
<p>The White House maintains direct control over the EPA, and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power. Republicans and Democrats differ in their approaches to, and perceived concerns of, environmental justice. While President Bill Clinton signed the executive order 12898, the Bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices, which in turn affected the motivation for environmental enforcement.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Responsibilities_of_the_EPA">Responsibilities of the EPA</span></h5>
<p>The EPA is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes, informing the public of environmental enforcement, and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution, water pollution, hazardous wastes and chemicals. While the EPA aids in preventing and identifying hazardous situations, it is hard to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities. It is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to. The EPA answers to various groups, competes for resources, and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment. All of these present challenges, including a lack of resources, its self-policing policy, and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for EPA officers.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Authority_of_the_EPA">Authority of the EPA</span></h5>
<p>Under different circumstances, the EPA faces many limitations to enforcing environmental justice. It does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities.</p>
