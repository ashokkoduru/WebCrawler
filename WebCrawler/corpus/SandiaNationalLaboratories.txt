<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lab_history">Lab history</span></h2>

<p>Sandia National Laboratories' roots go back to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Project" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Prior to the United States formally entering the war, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> leased land near an Albuquerque, New Mexico airport known as Oxnard Field, to service transient Army and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Navy" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> aircraft. In January 1941 construction began on the Albuquerque Army Air Base, leading to establishment of the <i>Bombardier School-Army Advanced Flying School</i> near the end of the year. Soon thereafter it was renamed Kirtland Field, after early Army military pilot Colonel <a href="/wiki/Roy_C._Kirtland" title="Roy C. Kirtland">Roy C. Kirtland</a>, and in mid-1942 the Army acquired Oxnard Field. During the war years facilities were expanded further and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kirtland_Field" title="Kirtland Field">Kirtland Field</a> served as a major Army Air Forces training installation.</p>
<p>In the many months leading up to successful detonation of the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_bomb" title="Atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trinity_site" title="Trinity site">Trinity</a> test, and delivery of the first airborne atomic weapon, <a href="/wiki/Project_Alberta" title="Project Alberta">Project Alberta</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" title="J. Robert Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, Director of <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>, and his technical advisor, Hartly Rowe, began looking for a new site convenient to Los Alamos for the continuation of weapons development –  especially its non-nuclear aspects. They felt a separate division would be best to perform these functions. Kirtland had fulfilled Los Alamos' transportation needs for both the Trinity and Alberta projects, thus, Oxnard Field was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Army Air Corps to the U.S. Army Service Forces Chief of Engineer District, and thereafter, assigned to the Manhattan Engineer District. In July 1945, the forerunner of Sandia Laboratory, known as "Z" Division, was established at Oxnard Field to handle future weapons development, testing, and bomb assembly for the Manhattan Engineer District. The District-directive calling for establishing a secure area and construction of "Z" Division facilities referred to this as "<a href="/wiki/Sandia_Base" title="Sandia Base">Sandia Base</a>" , after the nearby <a href="/wiki/Sandia_Mountains" title="Sandia Mountains">Sandia Mountains</a> — apparently the first official recognition of the "Sandia" name.</p>
<p>Sandia Laboratory was operated by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California" title="University of California">University of California</a> until 1949, when President <a href="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> asked <a href="/wiki/Western_Electric" title="Western Electric">Western Electric</a>, a subsidiary of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Telephone_and_Telegraph" title="American Telephone and Telegraph">American Telephone and Telegraph</a> (AT&amp;T), to assume the operation as an "opportunity to render an exceptional service in the national interest." Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T Corporation, managed and operated the laboratory until October 1993. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> designated Sandia Laboratories as a National laboratory in 1979. Today, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is managed and operated by <b>Sandia Corporation</b>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_Corporation" title="Lockheed Martin Corporation">Lockheed Martin Corporation</a>, and includes government-owned facilities in <a href="/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a> (SNL/NM); <a href="/wiki/Livermore,_California" title="Livermore, California">Livermore, California</a> (SNL/CA); <a href="/wiki/Tonopah,_Nevada" title="Tonopah, Nevada">Tonopah, Nevada</a>; and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kauai,_Hawaii" title="Kauai, Hawaii">Kauai, Hawaii</a>. SNL/NM is headquarters and the largest laboratory, employing more than 6,600 employees, while SNL/CA is a smaller laboratory, with about 850 employees. Tonopah and Kauai are occupied on a "campaign" basis, as test schedules dictate.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_issues">Legal issues</span></h2>
<p>On February 13, 2007, a New Mexico State Court found Sandia Corporation liable for $4.7 million in damages for the firing of a former network security analyst, <a href="/wiki/Shawn_Carpenter" title="Shawn Carpenter">Shawn Carpenter</a>, who had reported to his supervisors that hundreds of military installations and defense contractors' networks were compromised and sensitive information was being stolen –  including hundreds of sensitive <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_Martin" title="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed</a> documents on the <a href="/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter" title="Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> project. When his supervisors told him to drop the investigation and do nothing with the information, he went to intelligence officials in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> and later the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> to address the national security breaches. When Sandia managers discovered his actions months later, they revoked his <a href="/wiki/Security_clearance" title="Security clearance">security clearance</a> and fired him.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technical_areas">Technical areas</span></h2>
<p>SNL/NM consists of five technical areas (TA) and several additional test areas. Each TA has its own distinctive operations; however, the operations of some groups at Sandia may span more than one TA, with one part of a team working on a problem from one angle, and another subset of the same team located in a different building or area working with other specialized equipment. A description of each area is given below.</p>
<p>TA-I operations are dedicated primarily to three activities –  the design, research, and development of <a href="/wiki/Weapon" title="Weapon">weapon</a> systems; limited production of weapon system components; and energy programs. TA-I facilities include the main <a href="/wiki/Library" title="Library">library</a> and offices, <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratories</a>, and shops used by administrative and technical staff.</p>
<p>TA-II is a 45-acre (180,000 m²) facility that was established in 1948 for the assembly of chemical <a href="/wiki/Explosive_material" title="Explosive material">high explosive</a> main <a href="/wiki/Explosive_material" title="Explosive material">charges</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> and later for production scale assembly of nuclear weapons. Activities in TA-II include the <a href="/wiki/Decontamination" title="Decontamination">decontamination</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_decommissioning" title="Nuclear decommissioning">decommissioning</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_remediation" title="Environmental remediation">remediation</a> of facilities and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Landfills" title="Landfills">landfills</a> used in past research and development activities. Remediation of the Classified Waste Landfill which started in March 1998, neared completion in FY2000. A testing facility, the Explosive Component Facility, integrates many of the previous TA-II test activities as well as some testing activities previously performed in other remote test areas. The Access Delay Technology Test Facility is also located in TA-II.</p>
<p>TA-III is adjacent to and south of TA-V [both are approximately seven miles (11 km) south of TA-I]. TA-III facilities include extensive design-test facilities such as <a href="/wiki/Rocket_sled" title="Rocket sled">rocket sled</a> tracks, <a href="/wiki/Centrifuge" title="Centrifuge">centrifuges</a> and a radiant <a href="/wiki/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a> facility. Other facilities in TA-III include a paper destructor, the Melting and Solidification Laboratory and the Radioactive and Mixed Waste Management Facility (RMWMF). RMWMF serves as central processing facility for packaging and storage of low-level and mixed waste. The remediation of the Chemical Waste Landfill, which started in September 1998, is an ongoing activity in TA-III.</p>
<p>TA-IV, located approximately 1/2 mile (1 km) south of TA-I, consists of several inertial-confinement <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" title="Nuclear fusion">fusion</a> research and pulsed power research facilities, including the High Energy Radiation Megavolt Electron Source (Hermes-III), the <a href="/wiki/Z_Pulsed_Power_Facility" title="Z Pulsed Power Facility">Z Facility</a>, the Short Pulsed High Intensity Nanosecond X-Radiator (SPHINX) Facility, and the Saturn Accelerator. TA-IV also hosts some computer science and cognition research.</p>
<p>TA-V contains two research <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_technology" title="Nuclear reactor technology">reactor</a> facilities, an intense <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma</a> irradiation facility (using <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt-60</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium-137</a> sources), and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hot_Cell" title="Hot Cell">Hot Cell</a> Facility.</p>
<p>SNL/NM also has test areas outside of the five technical areas listed above. These test areas, collectively known as Coyote Test Field, are located southeast of TA-III and/or in the canyons on the west side of the Manzanita Mountains. Facilities in the Coyote Canyon Test Field include the Solar Tower Facility (34.9623 N, 106.5097 W), the Lurance Canyon Burn Site and the Aerial Cable Facility.</p>

This collaboration has focused on enhancing the information visualization capabilities of VTK and has in turn fed back into other projects such as ParaView and Titan.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Self-guided_bullet">Self-guided bullet</span></h2>
<p>On 30 January 2012, Sandia announced that they successfully test-fired a self-guided dart that can hit targets at 2,000 m (2,187 yd). The dart is 4 in (100 mm) long, has its center of gravity at the nose, and is made to be fired from a small-caliber <a href="/wiki/Smoothbore" title="Smoothbore">smoothbore</a> gun. It is kept straight in flight by four <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetism" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetically</a> actuated fins encased in a plastic puller <a href="/wiki/Sabot" title="Sabot">sabot</a> that fall off when the dart leaves the bore. The dart cannot be fired from conventional <a href="/wiki/Rifling" title="Rifling">rifled</a> barrels because the gyroscopic stability provided by rifling grooves for regular bullets would prevent the self-guided bullet from reliably turning towards a target when in flight, so fins are responsible for stabilizing rather than spinning. A <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a> designator marks a target, which is tracked by the dart's optical sensor and 8-bit <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPU" title="CPU">CPU</a>. The guided projectile is kept cheap because it does not need an <a href="/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit" title="Inertial measurement unit">inertial measurement unit</a>, since its small size allows it to make the fast corrections necessary without the aid of an IMU. The natural body frequency of the bullet is about 30 <a href="/wiki/Hertz" title="Hertz">hertz</a>, so corrections can be made 30 times per second in flight. Muzzle velocity with commercial gunpowder is 2,400 ft/s (730 m/s) (Mach 2.1), but military customized gunpowder can increase its speed and range. Computer modeling shows that a standard bullet would miss a target at 1,000 m (1,094 yd) by 9.8 yd (9 m), while an equivalent guided bullet would hit within 8 in (20 cm). Accuracy actually increases as distances get longer, since the bullet's motions settle more the longer it is in flight.</p>
