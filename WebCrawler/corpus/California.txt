<p>What is now California was first settled by <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_California" title="Indigenous peoples of California">various Native American tribes</a> before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries.

The western portion of Alta California was organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a> starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom.</p>
<p>California's diverse geography ranges from the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada</a> in the east to the <a href="/wiki/Coastal_California" title="Coastal California">Pacific Coast</a> in the west, from the <a href="/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens" title="Sequoia sempervirens">redwood</a>–<a href="/wiki/Douglas_fir" title="Douglas fir">Douglas fir</a> forests of the northwest, to the <a href="/wiki/Mojave_Desert" title="Mojave Desert">Mojave Desert</a> areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_Central_Valley" title="California Central Valley">Central Valley</a>, a major agricultural area.

About 37,000 <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Etymology_of_California" title="Etymology of California">Etymology of California</a></div>
<p>The word <i>California</i> originally referred to the entire region composed of the <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula" title="Baja California Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a> of Mexico, the current United States states of California, <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, and parts of <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>.</p>
<p>The name <i>California</i> is surmised by some writers to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_People" title="Black People">Black</a> <a href="/wiki/Amazons" title="Amazons">Amazons</a> and ruled by Queen <a href="/wiki/Calafia" title="Calafia">Calafia</a>, who fought alongside Muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader, the Caliph, fictionally implying that California was the Caliphate. The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work <i><a href="/wiki/Las_sergas_de_Esplandi%C3%A1n" title="Las sergas de Esplandián">The Adventures of Esplandián</a></i>, written as a sequel to <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amadis_de_Gaula" title="Amadis de Gaula">Amadis de Gaula</a></i> by Spanish adventure writer <a href="/wiki/Garci_Rodr%C3%ADguez_de_Montalvo" title="Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo">Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo</a>. The kingdom of Queen Calafia, according to Montalvo, was said to be a remote land inhabited by <a href="/wiki/Griffin" title="Griffin">griffins</a> and other strange beasts, and rich in gold.</p>

<p>Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pre-Columbian_North_America" title="Pre-Columbian North America">pre-Columbian North America</a>. Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000.

California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the <a href="/wiki/Chumash_people" title="Chumash people">Chumash</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pomo_people" title="Pomo people">Pomo</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salinan" title="Salinan">Salinan</a>.

<p>The first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the <a href="/wiki/Russian_River_(California)" title="Russian River (California)">Russian River</a> was a <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish</a> sailing expedition, led by Portuguese captain <a href="/wiki/Juan_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Cabrillo" title="Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo">Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo</a>, in 1542. Some 37 years later English explorer <a href="/wiki/Francis_Drake" title="Francis Drake">Francis Drake</a> also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the <a href="/wiki/Manila_galleon" title="Manila galleon">Manila galleons</a> on their return trips from the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> beginning in 1565. The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Overseas_Filipino" title="Overseas Filipino">Filipino</a> sailors arrived in Spanish ships at <a href="/wiki/Morro_Bay,_California" title="Morro Bay, California">Morro Bay</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Vizca%C3%ADno" title="Sebastián Vizcaíno">Sebastián Vizcaíno</a> explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for <a href="/wiki/New_Spain" title="New Spain">New Spain</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodríguez's idea of California as an island persisted. That depiction appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.</p>
<p>After the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portol%C3%A0_expedition" title="Portolà expedition">Portolà expedition</a> of 1769-70, Spanish <a href="/wiki/Missionary" title="Missionary">missionaries</a> began setting up 21 <a href="/wiki/Spanish_missions_in_California" title="Spanish missions in California">California Missions</a> on or near the coast of <a href="/wiki/Alta_California" title="Alta California">Alta (Upper) California</a>, beginning in San Diego. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (<i><a href="/wiki/Presidio" title="Presidio">presidios</a></i>) and three small towns (<i>pueblos</i>). Two of the pueblos grew into the cities of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Jose,_California" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a>. The Spanish colonization brought the <a href="/wiki/California_Genocide" title="California Genocide">genocide of the indigenous Californian peoples</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19th_century">19th century</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Imperial Russia</a> explored the California coast and established a trading post at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fort_Ross" title="Fort Ross">Fort Ross</a>. Its early 19th-century coastal settlements north of <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> constituted the southernmost Russian colony in North America and were spread over an area stretching from <a href="/wiki/Point_Arena,_California" title="Point Arena, California">Point Arena</a> to <a href="/wiki/Tomales_Bay" title="Tomales Bay">Tomales Bay</a>.</p>
<p>In 1821 the <a href="/wiki/Mexican_War_of_Independence" title="Mexican War of Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a> gave <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> (including California) independence from Spain; for the next 25 years, <a href="/wiki/Alta_California" title="Alta California">Alta California</a> remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico.</p>
<p>Cattle ranches, or <i><a href="/wiki/Ranchos_of_California" title="Ranchos of California">ranchos</a></i>, emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. After Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secularized" title="Secularized">secularized</a> by 1834. The ranchos developed under ownership by <a href="/wiki/Californio" title="Californio">Californios</a> (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants.</p>
<p>From the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada arrived in Northern California. These new arrivals used the <a href="/wiki/Siskiyou_Trail" title="Siskiyou Trail">Siskiyou Trail</a>, <a href="/wiki/California_Trail" title="California Trail">California Trail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oregon_Trail" title="Oregon Trail">Oregon Trail</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_Spanish_Trail_(trade_route)" title="Old Spanish Trail (trade route)">Old Spanish Trail</a> to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California.</p>
<p>Between 1831 and 1836, California experienced a series of revolts against Mexico; this culminated in the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=1836_California_revolt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="1836 California revolt (page does not exist)">1836 California revolt</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Juan_Bautista_Alvarado" title="Juan Bautista Alvarado">Juan Bautista Alvarado</a>, which ended after Mexico appointed him governor of the department. The revolt, which had momentarily declared California an independent state, was successful with the assistance of <a href="/wiki/Americans" title="Americans">American</a> and <a href="/wiki/British_people" title="British people">British</a> residents of California, including <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Graham" title="Isaac Graham">Isaac Graham</a>; after 1840, 100 of those residents who did not have passports were arrested, leading to the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Graham_affair&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Graham affair (page does not exist)">Graham affair</a> in 1840.</p>
<p>One of the largest ranchers in California was <a href="/wiki/John_Marsh_(pioneer)" title="John Marsh (pioneer)">John Marsh</a>. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, soil and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as "Marsh's route." His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California. He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.</p>
<p>After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh helped end the rule of the last Mexican governor of California, thereby paving the way to California's ultimate acquisition by the United States.</p>
<p>In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bear_Flag_Revolt#Bear_Flag_Revolt" title="Bear Flag Revolt">Bear Flag Revolt</a>. Afterwards, rebels raised the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bear_Flag" title="Bear Flag">Bear Flag</a> (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words "California Republic") at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was <a href="/wiki/William_B._Ide" title="William B. Ide">William B. Ide</a>, who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt.</p>
<p>The California Republic was short lived; the same year marked the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War" title="Mexican–American War">Mexican–American War</a> (1846–48). When Commodore <a href="/wiki/John_D._Sloat" title="John D. Sloat">John D. Sloat</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> sailed into <a href="/wiki/Monterey_Bay" title="Monterey Bay">Monterey Bay</a> and began the military occupation of California by the United States, Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the United States forces. After a series of defensive battles in <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Cahuenga" title="Treaty of Cahuenga">Treaty of Cahuenga</a> was signed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Californios" title="Californios">Californios</a> on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo" title="Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> that ended the war, the western territory of Alta California, became the United States state of California, and <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a> became United States Territories. The lightly populated lower region of California, the Baja Peninsula, remained in the possession of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>In 1846 the non-native population of California was estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769. After gold was discovered in 1848, the population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. By 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come. Between 1847 and 1870, the population of <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> increased from 500 to 150,000. On September 9, 1850, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Compromise_of_1850" title="Compromise of 1850">Compromise of 1850</a>, California was admitted to the United States undivided as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_state_(USA)" title="Free state (USA)">free state</a>, denying the expansion of <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" title="Slavery in the United States">slavery</a> to the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>California's native population precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity. As in other states, the native inhabitants were forcibly removed from their lands by incoming miners, ranchers, and farmers. And although California entered the union as a free state, the "loitering or orphaned Indians" were de facto enslaved by Mexican and Anglo-American masters under the 1853 <i>Act for the Government and Protection of Indians</i>. There were massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Between 1850 and 1860, California paid around 1.5 million dollars (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government) to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. In later decades, the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them. As a result, the rise of California was a calamity for the native inhabitants. Several scholars and Native American activists, including Benjamin Madley and <a href="/wiki/Ed_Castillo" title="Ed Castillo">Ed Castillo</a>, have described the actions of the California government as a genocide.</p>
<p>The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule was located at <a href="/wiki/Monterey,_California" title="Monterey, California">Monterey</a> from 1777 until 1845. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pio_Pico" title="Pio Pico">Pio Pico</a>, last Mexican governor of Alta California, moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845. The United States <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consulate" title="Consulate">consulate</a> was also located in Monterey, under consul <a href="/wiki/Thomas_O._Larkin" title="Thomas O. Larkin">Thomas O. Larkin</a>.</p>
<p>In 1849, the Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first legislative sessions were held in <a href="/wiki/San_Jose,_California" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a> (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included <a href="/wiki/Vallejo,_California" title="Vallejo, California">Vallejo</a> (1852–1853), and nearby <a href="/wiki/Benicia,_California" title="Benicia, California">Benicia</a> (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in <a href="/wiki/Sacramento,_California" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a> since 1854 with only a short break in 1861 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento.</p>
<p>Initially, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States was time consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the <a href="/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad" title="First Transcontinental Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a> through <a href="/wiki/Donner_Pass" title="Donner Pass">Donner Pass</a> in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Once completed, hundreds of thousands of United States citizens came west, where new Californians were discovering that land in the state, if irrigated during the dry summer months, was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>

<p>Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Highway" title="Lincoln Highway">Lincoln Highway</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Route_66_(California)" title="U.S. Route 66 (California)">Route 66</a>. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.</p>
<p>To meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the <a href="/wiki/California_Aqueduct" title="California Aqueduct">California</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Aqueduct" title="Los Angeles Aqueduct">Los Angeles Aqueducts</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Oroville_Dam" title="Oroville Dam">Oroville</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shasta_Dam" title="Shasta Dam">Shasta Dams</a>; and the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge" title="San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge">Bay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate</a> Bridges were built across the state. The state government also adopted the <a href="/wiki/California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education" title="California Master Plan for Higher Education">California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the <a href="/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">studio system</a> in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, ranking third (behind <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_(state)" title="New York (state)">New York</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>) among the 48 states. After World War II, California's economy greatly expanded due to strong <a href="/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer" title="Aerospace manufacturer">aerospace</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defense_industry" title="Defense industry">defense</a> industries, whose size decreased following the end of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> and its Dean of Engineering <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Terman" title="Frederick Terman">Frederick Terman</a> began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>. As a result of these efforts, California is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the United States center of agricultural production. Just before the <a href="/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" title="Dot-com bubble">"Dot Com Bust"</a> California had the 5th largest economy in the world among nations. Yet since 1991, and starting in the late 1980s in <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a>, California has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years. This is often referred to by the media as the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=California_exodus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="California exodus (page does not exist)">California exodus</a>.</p>
<p>However, during the 20th century, two great disasters happened in California. The <a href="/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" title="1906 San Francisco earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> and 1928 <a href="/wiki/St._Francis_Dam" title="St. Francis Dam">St. Francis Dam</a> flood remain the deadliest in U.S history.</p>

<p>California is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_area" title="List of U.S. states by area">3rd largest state in the United States</a> in area, after <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>. California is often geographically bisected into two regions, <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a>, comprising the 10 southernmost counties, and <a href="/wiki/Northern_California" title="Northern California">Northern California</a>, comprising the 48 northernmost counties.</p>
<p>In the middle of the state lies the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_Central_Valley" title="California Central Valley">California Central Valley</a>, bounded by the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada</a> in the east, the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Ranges" title="Pacific Coast Ranges">coastal mountain ranges</a> in the west, the <a href="/wiki/Cascade_Range" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> to the north and by the <a href="/wiki/Tehachapi_Mountains" title="Tehachapi Mountains">Tehachapi Mountains</a> in the south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland.</p>
<p>Divided in two by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sacramento-San_Joaquin_River_Delta" title="Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta">Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta</a>, the northern portion, the <a href="/wiki/Sacramento_Valley" title="Sacramento Valley">Sacramento Valley</a> serves as the watershed of the <a href="/wiki/Sacramento_River" title="Sacramento River">Sacramento River</a>, while the southern portion, the <a href="/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley" title="San Joaquin Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a> is the watershed for the <a href="/wiki/San_Joaquin_River" title="San Joaquin River">San Joaquin River</a>. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seaport" title="Seaport">seaports</a>.</p>
<p>The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of <a href="/wiki/Pump_(Water)" title="Pump (Water)">pumps</a> and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California" title="Channel Islands of California">Channel Islands</a> are located off the <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern</a> <a href="/wiki/South_Coast_(California)" title="South Coast (California)">coast</a>.</p>
<p>The Sierra Nevada (Spanish for "snowy range") includes the highest peak in the <a href="/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">contiguous 48 states</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mount_Whitney" title="Mount Whitney">Mount Whitney</a>, at 14,505 feet (4,421 m).

<p>To the east of the Sierra Nevada are <a href="/wiki/Owens_Valley" title="Owens Valley">Owens Valley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mono_Lake" title="Mono Lake">Mono Lake</a>, an essential <a href="/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory bird</a> habitat. In the western part of the state is <a href="/wiki/Clear_Lake_(California)" title="Clear Lake (California)">Clear Lake</a>, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including <a href="/wiki/Palisade_Glacier" title="Palisade Glacier">Palisade Glacier</a>, the southernmost glacier in the United States.</p>
<p>About 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests, and California's diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. Many of the trees in the <a href="/wiki/White_Mountains_(California)" title="White Mountains (California)">California White Mountains</a> are the oldest in the world; an individual <a href="/wiki/Bristlecone_pine" title="Bristlecone pine">bristlecone pine</a> is over 5,000 years old.</p>
<p>In the south is a large inland salt lake, the <a href="/wiki/Salton_Sea" title="Salton Sea">Salton Sea</a>. The south-central desert is called the <a href="/wiki/Mojave_Desert" title="Mojave Desert">Mojave</a>; to the northeast of the Mojave lies <a href="/wiki/Death_Valley" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a>, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the <a href="/wiki/Badwater_Basin" title="Badwater Basin">Badwater Basin</a> at −279 feet (−85 m). The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles (140 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the <a href="/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a>, from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.</p>
<p>Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas, including the <a href="/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles_Area" title="Greater Los Angeles Area">Greater Los Angeles Area</a>, the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area" title="San Francisco Bay Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Diego_metropolitan_area" title="San Diego metropolitan area">San Diego metropolitan area</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pacific_Ring_of_Fire" title="Pacific Ring of Fire">Ring of Fire</a>, California is subject to <a href="/wiki/Tsunami" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flood" title="Flood">floods</a>, droughts, <a href="/wiki/Santa_Ana_winds" title="Santa Ana winds">Santa Ana winds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wildfire" title="Wildfire">wildfires</a>, <a href="/wiki/Landslide" title="Landslide">landslides</a> on steep terrain, and has several <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volcanoes" title="Volcanoes">volcanoes</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Climate_of_California" title="Climate of California">Climate of California</a></div>
<p>Although most of the state has a <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_climate" title="Mediterranean climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, due to the state's large size, the climate ranges from <a href="/wiki/Subarctic_climate" title="Subarctic climate">subarctic</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subtropical_climate" title="Subtropical climate">subtropical</a>. The cool <a href="/wiki/California_Current" title="California Current">California Current</a> offshore often creates summer <a href="/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a> near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_of_the_Los_Angeles_Basin" title="Climate of the Los Angeles Basin">warmer</a> than at the coast. The same <a href="/wiki/Microclimate" title="Microclimate">microclimate</a> phenomenon is seen in the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area#Climate" title="San Francisco Bay Area">climate</a> of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean.</p>
<p>Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a <a href="/wiki/Temperate_climate" title="Temperate climate">temperate climate</a>, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada</a>, have an <a href="/wiki/Alpine_climate" title="Alpine climate">alpine climate</a> with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.</p>
<p>California's mountains produce <a href="/wiki/Rain_shadow" title="Rain shadow">rain shadows</a> on the eastern side, creating extensive <a href="/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">deserts</a>. The higher elevation deserts of <a href="/wiki/Eastern_California" title="Eastern California">eastern California</a> have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. <a href="/wiki/Death_Valley" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a>, a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world, 134 °F (56.7 °C), was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in California was −45 °F (−43 °C) in 1937 in <a href="/wiki/Boca,_California" title="Boca, California">Boca</a>.</p>
<p>The table below lists average temperatures for August and December in some of the major urban areas of California. Since extremes like the cool summers of the <a href="/wiki/Humboldt_Bay" title="Humboldt Bay">Humboldt Bay</a> and the extreme heat of <a href="/wiki/Death_Valley" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a> do not effect any major urban areas these are not listed.</p>

After European contact, these were generally replaced by <a href="/wiki/Invasive_species" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a> of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.</p>
<p>Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.</p>
<p>Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The <a href="/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia" title="Yucca brevifolia">Joshua tree</a> is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of <a href="/wiki/Aster_(genus)" title="Aster (genus)">asters</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fremont_cottonwood" title="Fremont cottonwood">Fremont cottonwood</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valley_oak" title="Valley oak">valley oak</a> thrive in the Central Valley.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of California was 39,144,818 on July 1, 2015, a 5.08% increase since the <a href="/wiki/2010_United_States_Census" title="2010 United States Census">2010 United States Census</a>. Between 2000 and 2009, there was a natural increase of 3,090,016 (5,058,440 births minus 2,179,958 deaths). During this time period, <a href="/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States" title="Immigration to the United States">international migration</a> produced a net increase of 1,816,633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1,509,708, resulting in a net in-migration of 306,925 people. The state of California's own statistics show a population of 38,292,687 for January 1, 2009. However, according to the <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Institute_for_Policy_Research" title="Manhattan Institute for Policy Research">Manhattan Institute for Policy Research</a>, since 1990 almost 3.4 million Californians have moved to other states, with most leaving to Texas, Nevada, and Arizona.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h4>
<p>Starting in the year 2010, for the first time since the <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, California-born residents make up the majority of the state's population. Along with the rest of the United States, California's immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s-early 2010s. Immigration from <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. 57% came from Asian countries vs. 22% from Latin American countries. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Net_immigration" title="Net immigration">Net immigration</a> from Mexico, previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants has dropped to zero/less than zero, since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating. As a result it is estimated that Hispanics citizens will constitute 49% of the population by 2060, instead of the previously projected 2050, due primarily to domestic births.</p>
<p>The state's population of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Illegal_immigrants" title="Illegal immigrants">undocumenteds</a> has been shrinking in recent years, due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers. The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest plunged from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to just 367,000 in 2011. Despite these recent trends, <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States" title="Illegal immigration to the United States">illegal</a> <a href="/wiki/Alien_(law)" title="Alien (law)">aliens</a> constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state's population, the third highest percentage of any state in the <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigrant_population_of_the_United_States" title="Illegal immigrant population of the United States">country</a>, totaling nearly 2.6 million. In particular, illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California" title="Los Angeles County, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monterey_County,_California" title="Monterey County, California">Monterey</a>, <a href="/wiki/San_Benito_County,_California" title="San Benito County, California">San Benito</a>, <a href="/wiki/Imperial_County,_California" title="Imperial County, California">Imperial</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Napa_County,_California" title="Napa County, California">Napa</a> Counties – the latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor. More than half of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico.</p>

<p>As of 2011, 75.1% of California's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).</p>
<p>In terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents.

<p>California has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families.

<p>Public <a href="/wiki/Secondary_education_in_the_United_States" title="Secondary education in the United States">secondary education</a> consists of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_school#United_States" title="High school">high schools</a> that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a <a href="/wiki/California_Proposition_98_(1988)" title="California Proposition 98 (1988)">unique constitutional amendment</a> that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K–12 and <a href="/wiki/Community_college" title="Community college">community colleges</a> that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures.</p>
<p>California had over 6.2 million school students in the 2005–06 school year. Funding and staffing levels in California schools lag behind other states. In expenditure per pupil, California ranked 29th (of the 50 states and the <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">District of Columbia</a>) in 2005–06. In teaching staff expenditure per pupil, California ranked 49th of 51. In overall teacher-pupil ratio, California was also 49th, with 21 students per teacher. Only Arizona and Utah were lower.</p>
<p>A 2007 study concluded that California's public school system was "broken" in that it suffered from over-regulation.</p>
<p>California's public <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Postsecondary_education" title="Postsecondary education">postsecondary education</a> offers three separate systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The research university system in the state is the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California" title="University of California">University of California</a> (UC), a <a href="/wiki/Public_university" title="Public university">public university</a> system. As of fall 2011, the University of California had a combined <a href="/wiki/Student" title="Student">student</a> body of 234,464 students. There are ten general UC campuses, and a number of specialized campuses in the UC system. The system was originally intended to accept the top one-eighth of California high school students, but several of the schools have become even more selective. The UC system was originally given exclusive authority in awarding Ph.Ds, but this has since changed and the CSU is also able to award several Doctoral degrees.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/California_State_University" title="California State University">California State University</a> (CSU) system has almost 430,000 students, making it the largest university system in the United States. The CSU was originally intended to accept the top one-third of California high school students, but several of the schools have become much more selective. The CSU was originally set up to award only bachelor's and master's degrees, but has since been granted the authority to award several Doctoral degrees.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/California_Community_Colleges_System" title="California Community Colleges System">California Community Colleges System</a> provides lower division coursework as well as basic skills and workforce training. It is the largest network of higher education in the US, composed of 112 colleges serving a student population of over 2.6 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>California is also home to such notable private universities as <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a>, the <a href="/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Claremont_Colleges" title="Claremont Colleges">Claremont Colleges</a>.

<p>The economy of California is large enough to be comparable to that of the largest of countries. As of 2016, the <a href="/wiki/Gross_state_product" title="Gross state product">gross state product</a> (GSP) is about $2.514 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1000000000000_(number)" title="1000000000000 (number)">trillion</a>, the largest in the United States. California is responsible for 13.9 percent of the United States' approximate $18.1 trillion gross domestic product (GDP). California's GSP is larger than the GDP of all but 5 countries in dollar terms (the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>), larger than Brazil, France, Russia, Italy, India, Canada, Australia, Spain and Turkey. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Purchasing_Power_Parity" title="Purchasing Power Parity">Purchasing Power Parity</a>, it is larger than all but 10 countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, Germany, Russia, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, and Indonesia), larger than Italy, Mexico, Spain, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Turkey.</p>
<p>The five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality. In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing. As of September 2016, California has an <a href="/wiki/California_unemployment_statistics" title="California unemployment statistics">unemployment</a> rate of 5.5%.</p>
<p>California's economy is dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for about one-quarter of the state's economy. In 2008, California exported $144 billion worth of goods, up from $134 billion in 2007 and $127 billion in 2006. Computers and electronic products are California's top export, accounting for 42 percent of all the state's exports in 2008.</p>
<p>Agriculture is an important sector in California's economy. Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004. This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production. In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue. In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue. The Agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce. According to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</a> in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were <a href="/wiki/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>, shelled <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Almonds" title="Almonds">almonds</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grapes" title="Grapes">grapes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP_per_capita" title="List of U.S. states by GDP per capita">Per capita GDP</a> in 2007 was $38,956, ranking eleventh in the nation. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_locations_by_per_capita_income" title="California locations by per capita income">Per capita income</a> varies widely by geographic region and profession.

<p>State spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011. California, with 12% of the United States population, has one-third of the nation's <a href="/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States" title="Social programs in the United States">welfare</a> recipients. California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion. In January 2011 the California's total debt was at least $265 billion. On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however the state's debt remains at $132 billion.</p>
<p>With the passage of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_Proposition_30_(2012)" title="California Proposition 30 (2012)">Proposition 30 in 2012</a>, California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> rate with ten <a href="/wiki/Tax_bracket" title="Tax bracket">tax brackets</a>, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000. California has a <a href="/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States#California" title="Sales taxes in the United States">state sales tax</a> of 7.5%, though local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes. Many of these taxes are temporary for a seven-year period (as stipulated in Proposition 30) and afterwards will revert to a previous maximum marginal income tax bracket of 10.3% and state sales tax rate of 7.25%.</p>
<p>All <a href="/wiki/Real_property" title="Real property">real property</a> is taxable annually; the tax is based on the property's fair market value at the time of purchase or new construction.

<p>Because it is the most populous United States state, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its <i>per capita</i> energy use is one of the smallest of any United States state. Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via <a href="/wiki/Path_15" title="Path 15">Path 15</a> and <a href="/wiki/Path_66" title="Path 66">Path 66</a>) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via <a href="/wiki/Path_46" title="Path 46">Path 46</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> goals in the United States, with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020. Currently, several <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_power_plants" title="Solar power plants">solar power plants</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Solar_Energy_Generating_Systems" title="Solar Energy Generating Systems">Solar Energy Generating Systems</a> facility are located in the <a href="/wiki/Mojave_Desert" title="Mojave Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_California" title="Wind power in California">California's wind farms</a> include <a href="/wiki/Altamont_Pass_Wind_Farm" title="Altamont Pass Wind Farm">Altamont Pass</a>, <a href="/wiki/San_Gorgonio_Pass_Wind_Farm" title="San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm">San Gorgonio Pass</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tehachapi_Pass_Wind_Farm" title="Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm">Tehachapi Pass</a>.

<p>California's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre feet of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects. Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/California_Water_Wars" title="California Water Wars">California Water Wars</a>, a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies. Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: "We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. And everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water."</p>

<p>California is divided into 58 <a href="/wiki/County_(United_States)" title="County (United States)">counties</a>. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_California" title="Constitution of California">Constitution of California</a>, they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards. In addition, the county serves as the local government for all <a href="/wiki/Unincorporated_area" title="Unincorporated area">unincorporated areas</a>.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="City_and_town_governments">City and town governments</span></h5>
<p>Incorporated cities and towns in California are either <a href="/wiki/Charter_city" title="Charter city">charter</a> or general-law municipalities. General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Council-manager_government" title="Council-manager government">council-manager</a> form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly-elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial.</p>

<p>California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter. In socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more <a href="/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="Modern liberalism in the United States">liberal</a> than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states.</p>
<p>Among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting, California was the second state <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_gubernatorial_recall_election,_2003" title="California gubernatorial recall election, 2003">to recall their state governor</a>, the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by voters (including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_Proposition_8" title="California Proposition 8">Proposition 8 in 2008</a>). Voters also passed <a href="/wiki/California_Proposition_71_(2004)" title="California Proposition 71 (2004)">Proposition 71 in 2004</a> to fund <a href="/wiki/Stem_cell" title="Stem cell">stem cell</a> research, and <a href="/wiki/California_Proposition_14_(2010)" title="California Proposition 14 (2010)">Proposition 14 in 2010</a> to completely change the state's <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" title="Primary election">primary election</a> process. California has also experienced <a href="/wiki/California_Water_Wars" title="California Water Wars">disputes over water rights</a>; and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tax_revolt" title="Tax revolt">tax revolt</a>, culminating with the passage of <a href="/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)" title="California Proposition 13 (1978)">Proposition 13 in 1978</a>, limiting state <a href="/wiki/Property_tax" title="Property tax">property taxes</a>.</p>
<p>The state's trend towards the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a> and away from the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Brown" title="Jerry Brown">Jerry Brown</a>; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more <a href="/wiki/Centrism" title="Centrism">centrist</a> than the national party.</p>

<p>The Democrats also now hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 56 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the Assembly; and 26 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the Senate.</p>
<p>The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections; Republicans have not won California's <a href="/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)" title="Electoral College (United States)">electoral votes</a> since 1988. Additionally, both the state's current Democratic United States Senators, <a href="/wiki/Dianne_Feinstein" title="Dianne Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Boxer" title="Barbara Boxer">Barbara Boxer</a>, have held onto their seats since they were first elected in 1992.</p>
<p>In the United States House, the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the CA delegation of the <a href="/wiki/110th_United_States_Congress" title="110th United States Congress">110th United States Congress</a> in 2007. As the result of <a href="/wiki/Gerrymandering" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>, the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained 4 seats and held a 38-15 majority in the delegation.</p>
<p>In general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous <a href="/wiki/Coastal_California" title="Coastal California">coastal regions</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_metropolitan_area" title="Los Angeles metropolitan area">Los Angeles metropolitan area</a> and the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area" title="San Francisco Bay Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. <a href="/wiki/Orange_County,_California" title="Orange County, California">Orange County</a> also remains mostly Republican. One study ranked <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Berkeley_California" title="Berkeley California">Berkeley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inglewood,_California" title="Inglewood, California">Inglewood</a> and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and <a href="/wiki/Bakersfield,_California" title="Bakersfield, California">Bakersfield</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orange,_California" title="Orange, California">Orange</a>, <a href="/wiki/Escondido,_California" title="Escondido, California">Escondido</a>, <a href="/wiki/Garden_Grove,_California" title="Garden Grove, California">Garden Grove</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Simi_Valley,_California" title="Simi Valley, California">Simi Valley</a> in the top 20 most conservative cities.</p>
<p>In October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote. Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and <a href="/wiki/Decline_to_State" title="Decline to State">Decline to State</a> (3,820,545). <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_County" title="Los Angeles County">Los Angeles County</a> had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.</p>

Through the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, California became the first state in the United States to recognize same-sex relationships in any legal capacity. In 2000, voters passed <a href="/wiki/California_Proposition_22_(2000)" title="California Proposition 22 (2000)">Proposition 22</a>, which restricted state recognition of marriage to opposite-sex couples. This was struck down by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_Supreme_Court" title="California Supreme Court">California Supreme Court</a> in May 2008, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage; however, this was overruled later that same year when California voters passed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proposition_8" title="Proposition 8">Proposition 8</a>.
