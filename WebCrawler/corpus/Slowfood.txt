<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>

<p>Slow Food began in Italy with the founding of its forerunner organisation, Arcigola, in 1986 to resist the opening of a <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Steps" title="Spanish Steps">Spanish Steps</a> in Rome. In 1989, the founding manifesto of the international Slow Food movement was signed in Paris, France by delegates from 15 countries.</p>
<p>At its heart is the aim to promote local foods and traditional gastronomy and food production. Conversely this means an opposition to <a href="/wiki/Fast_food" title="Fast food">fast food</a>, industrial food production and globalisation.</p>
<p>The Slow Food organisation has expanded to include over 100,000 members with branches in over 150 countries. Over 1,300 local <i>convivia</i> chapters exist. 360 convivia in Italy — to which the name <i>condotta</i> (singular) / <i>condotte</i> (plural) applies — are composed of 35,000 members, along with 450 other regional chapters around the world. The organisational structure is decentralised: each convivium has a leader who is responsible for promoting local artisans, local farmers, and local flavors through regional events such as <i>Taste Workshops</i>, wine tastings, and farmers' markets.</p>
<p>Offices have been opened in <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> (1995), <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> (1998), <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> (2000), <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> (2003), <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> (2005), the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>. Global headquarters are located in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bra_(CN)" title="Bra (CN)">Bra</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy. Numerous publications are put out by the organisation, in several languages around the world. Recent efforts at publicity include the world's largest food and wine fair, the <a class="external text" href="http://www.salonedelgusto.com/" rel="nofollow">Salone del Gusto</a> in <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>, a biennial cheese fair in Bra called <i>Cheese</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Genoa" title="Genoa">Genoan</a> fish festival called <a class="external text" href="http://www.slowfish.it/welcome_eng.lasso" rel="nofollow">SlowFish</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Terra_Madre" title="Terra Madre">Terra Madre</a> ("Mother Earth") world meeting of food communities.</p>
<p>In 2004, Slow Food opened a <a href="/wiki/University_of_Gastronomic_Sciences" title="University of Gastronomic Sciences">University of Gastronomic Sciences</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pollenzo" title="Pollenzo">Pollenzo</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Piedmont" title="Piedmont">Piedmont</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Colorno" title="Colorno">Colorno</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Emilia-Romagna" title="Emilia-Romagna">Emilia-Romagna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>. The Colorno branch has since been closed and transferred to Polenzo as well. Carlo Petrini and <a href="/wiki/Massimo_Montanari" title="Massimo Montanari">Massimo Montanari</a> are the leading figures in the creation of the University, whose goal is to promote awareness of good food and <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a>.</p>

<p>Founder and President Carlo Petrini, believes "everyone has the right to good, clean and fair food."  Good, meaning a high quality product with a flavorful taste, clean meaning the naturalness in the way the product was produced and transported and fair, meaning adequate pricing and treatment for both the consumers and producers.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>

<p>In 2008, Slow Food USA hosted its largest gathering to date dubbed <a href="/wiki/Slow_Food_Nation" title="Slow Food Nation">Slow Food Nation</a> in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2013, Slow Food USA has a membership of roughly 12,000, down from over 30,000 in 2008. In 2011 the organisation was forced to make a series of staff layoffs and reductions and had faced a significant reduction in their income from wealthy supporters. This was partly attributed to the economic recession, but also to disagreements within the movement and a loss of several key personalities.</p>
<p>Slow Food USA currently has 200 chapters, down from 225 chapters in 2011. These are locally based organisations that hold events and education outreach programs that benefit their communities while carrying out the message of the slow food and advancing the local environmental movement. The movement also encourages the creation of urban gardens.</p>
<p>Beyond the chapters established within the cities in the United States there are a number of Universities that are becoming recognised by Slow Food USA, including the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Slow Food-University of Wisconsin has five projects that are dedicated to the movement's efforts, including a Family Dinner Night, weekly cafe and a Farm to University scheme. From then there have been 46 Slow Food chapters established on campuses of higher education.</p>
<p>Notable members include <a href="/wiki/Alice_Waters" title="Alice Waters">Alice Waters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eric_Schlosser" title="Eric Schlosser">Eric Schlosser</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Pollan" title="Michael Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>. The Executive Director is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Richard_McCarthy_(Activist)" title="Richard McCarthy (Activist)">Richard McCarthy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, the organisation announced a partnership with fast-food chain Chipotle.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>Slow Food UK works to raise strategic awareness about sustainability and social justice issues surrounding food and farming in Britain. In 2014 Slow Food UK devolved into Slow Food England, Slow Food Scotland, Slow Food Cymru and Slow Food Northern Ireland. Slow Food UK as an entity provides administrative support to those nations and local groups, and the Slow Food UK Board is now made up of directors from the nations (Shane Holland (Chair) and Trine Hughes, Directors for England; John Cooke, Director for Scotland; Margaret Rees, Director for Wales; and Claire Marriage and <a href="/wiki/Craig_Sams" title="Craig Sams">Craig Sams</a> The 27 local groups are led by Slow Food members, who take significant grassroots action in their local communities.</p>
<p>Some of these groups are very large, such as Slow Food London, and run programmes such as the Slow Food Global Schools Twinning Programme which are more akin to the work of a National Office. Slow Food London is also the major campaigning Slow Food body within the UK, responding to every local, national and European consultation on food, fisheries and agriculture; and has even been a co-signatory in Judicial Review against the UK Government in regards to food and farming, retaining a leading firm of solicitors pro-bono on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Besides running national education programmes, such as Slow Food Kids, and Slow Food on Campus, Slow Food UK National Office co-ordinates fights to preserve British culinary heritage through the Chef Alliance and Forgotten Foods programmes (UK Ark of Taste). The Chef Alliance is a network of chefs committed to protecting Britain's edible biodiversity by cooking with Forgotten Foods, or foods that are produced on a very small scale and are being lost due to commercial varieties overtaking the market. The Forgotten Foods programme is part of the Slow Food International <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_Taste" title="Ark of Taste">Ark of Taste</a>. In 2014 the Chef Alliance had over 100 members, and over 80 Forgotten Foods.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Australia">Australia</span></h3>
<p>The Australian slow food movement aims to increase community awareness of the value from farm to market of good, clean, local food. A campaign is being mounted to have included in Slow Food International's <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_Taste" title="Ark of Taste">Ark of Taste</a> (nationally nominated threatened produce and food products) the following Australian foods: <a href="/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" title="Kangaroo Island">Kangaroo Island</a>'s Ligurian bee honey, the Queensland-native <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bunya_nut" title="Bunya nut">bunya nut</a>, bull-boar sausage from Victoria and Tasmanian Leatherwood honey.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wine">Wine</span></h2>
<p>In 2010, Slow Food International began its independent Slow Wine project with the release of a wine guide. Prior to 2010, Slow Food worked with publisher <a href="/wiki/Gambero_Rosso" title="Gambero Rosso">Gambero Rosso</a> to release a guide. The first edition of Slow Food's first solo effort was written only in Italian. The guide is an attempt to review not only the wines but the wineries and the people behind the bottle. There have been two new editions of the guide, now also available in English.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticisms">Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>Slow Food's aims have been compared to the <a href="/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement" title="Arts and Crafts movement">Arts and Crafts movement</a>'s response to 19th-century industrialisation,. Some of the criticisms aimed at the movement are socioeconomic. For example, without significantly altering the working day of the masses, slow food preparation can be an additional burden to whoever prepares food. In contrast, the more affluent society can afford the time and expense of developing 'taste', 'knowledge' and 'discernment'. Slow Food's stated aim of preserving itself from the "contagion of the multitude" can be seen as elitist.</p>
