<p>A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.</p>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a>, commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from <a href="/wiki/Rotorcraft" title="Rotorcraft">rotary-wing aircraft</a>, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gyroplane" title="Gyroplane">gyroplane</a> is both fixed-wing and rotary-wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large <a href="/wiki/Airliner" title="Airliner">airliners</a> and military cargo aircraft.</p>
<p>Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for <a href="/wiki/Lift_(soaring)" title="Lift (soaring)">lift</a> and an area for <a href="/wiki/Landing" title="Landing">landing</a>. The majority of aircraft also need an <a href="/wiki/Airport" title="Airport">airport</a> with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take off and landing on ice, snow and calm water.</p>
<p>The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the <a href="/wiki/Rocket" title="Rocket">rocket</a>. Commercial jets can reach up to 955 kilometres per hour (593 mph), single-engine aircraft 555 kilometres per hour (345 mph). Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incur high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places <a href="/wiki/Helicopter" title="Helicopter">helicopters</a> can be used. As of April 28, 2009 <i>The Guardian</i> article notes that, "the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rail">Rail</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport" title="Rail transport">Rail transport</a></div>


<p>Rail transport is where a <a href="/wiki/Train" title="Train">train</a> runs along a set of two parallel <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rail_tracks#Railway_rail" title="Rail tracks">rails</a>, known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored <a href="/wiki/Perpendicular" title="Perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to <a href="/wiki/Railroad_tie" title="Railroad tie">ties</a> (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rail_gauge" title="Rail gauge">gauge</a>. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete, or compressed <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">earth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gravel" title="Gravel">gravel</a> in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include <a href="/wiki/Monorail" title="Monorail">monorail</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maglev_(transport)" title="Maglev (transport)">maglev</a>.</p>
<p>A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" title="Locomotive">locomotive</a>, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by <a href="/wiki/Steam_locomotive" title="Steam locomotive">steam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diesel_locomotive" title="Diesel locomotive">diesel</a> or by <a href="/wiki/Electric_locomotive" title="Electric locomotive">electricity</a> supplied by <a href="/wiki/Railway_electrification_system" title="Railway electrification system">trackside systems</a>. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a <a href="/wiki/Multiple_unit" title="Multiple unit">multiple unit</a>. Also, a train can be powered by <a href="/wiki/Horsecar" title="Horsecar">horses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Funicular" title="Funicular">cables</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pneumatics" title="Pneumatics">pneumatics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">gas turbines</a>. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more <a href="/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency" title="Energy conversion efficiency">energy efficient</a>, though not as efficient as ships.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Inter-city_rail" title="Inter-city rail">Intercity</a> trains are long-haul services connecting cities; modern <a href="/wiki/High-speed_rail" title="High-speed rail">high-speed rail</a> is capable of speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph), but this requires specially built track. <a href="/wiki/Regional_rail" title="Regional rail">Regional</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commuter_rail" title="Commuter rail">commuter</a> trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity <a href="/wiki/Tram" title="Tram">tramways</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rapid_transit" title="Rapid transit">rapid transits</a>, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. Freight trains traditionally used <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Box_car" title="Box car">box cars</a>, requiring manual loading and unloading of the <a href="/wiki/Cargo" title="Cargo">cargo</a>. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Road">Road</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Road_transport" title="Road transport">Road transport</a></div>

<p>A road is an identifiable <a href="/wiki/Route_number" title="Route number">route</a>, way or <a href="/wiki/Trail" title="Trail">path</a> between two or more <a href="/wiki/Location_(geography)" title="Location (geography)">places</a>. Roads are typically smoothed, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pavement_(material)" title="Pavement (material)">paved</a>, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal <a href="/wiki/Construction" title="Construction">construction</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maintenance,_repair_and_operations" title="Maintenance, repair and operations">maintenance</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban areas</a>, roads may pass through a <a href="/wiki/City" title="City">city</a> or <a href="/wiki/Village" title="Village">village</a> and be named as <a href="/wiki/Street" title="Street">streets</a>, serving a dual function as urban space <a href="/wiki/Easement" title="Easement">easement</a> and route.</p>
<p>The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a <a href="/wiki/Wheel" title="Wheel">wheeled</a> passenger vehicle that carries its own <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_engine" title="Car engine">motor</a>. Other users of roads include <a href="/wiki/Bus" title="Bus">buses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Truck" title="Truck">trucks</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Motorcycles" title="Motorcycles">motorcycles</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bicycles" title="Bicycles">bicycles</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pedestrians" title="Pedestrians">pedestrians</a>. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide. Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.</p>
<p>Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of <a href="/wiki/Noise_pollution" title="Noise pollution">noise</a> and <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility. Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water">Water</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ship_transport" title="Ship transport">Ship transport</a></div>


<p>Water transport is movement by means of a <a href="/wiki/Watercraft" title="Watercraft">watercraft</a>—such as a <a href="/wiki/Barge" title="Barge">barge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boat" title="Boat">boat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ship" title="Ship">ship</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sailboat" title="Sailboat">sailboat</a>—over a body of water, such as a <a href="/wiki/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">ocean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lake" title="Lake">lake</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canal" title="Canal">canal</a> or <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">river</a>. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the <a href="/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)" title="Hull (watercraft)">hull</a> a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.</p>
<p>In the 19th century the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Steam_ships" title="Steam ships">steam ships</a> were developed, using a <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a> to drive a <a href="/wiki/Paddle_wheel" title="Paddle wheel">paddle wheel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Propeller" title="Propeller">propeller</a> to move the ship. The <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a> was produced in a <a href="/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boiler</a> using wood or <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and fed through a steam <a href="/wiki/External_combustion_engine" title="External combustion engine">external combustion engine</a>. Now most ships have an <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a> using a slightly refined type of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bunker_fuel" title="Bunker fuel">bunker fuel</a>. Some ships, such as <a href="/wiki/Submarine" title="Submarine">submarines</a>, use <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> to produce the steam. <a href="/wiki/Recreation" title="Recreation">Recreational</a> or <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">educational</a> craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more <a href="/wiki/Propeller" title="Propeller">propellers</a>, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, <a href="/wiki/Hovercraft" title="Hovercraft">hovercraft</a> are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See <a href="/wiki/Marine_propulsion" title="Marine propulsion">Marine propulsion</a>.)</p>
<p>Although slow, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007. Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shipping" title="Shipping">shipping</a>; <a href="/wiki/Short_sea_shipping" title="Short sea shipping">short sea shipping</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ferry" title="Ferry">ferries</a> remain viable in coastal areas.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_modes">Other modes</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">Pipeline transport</a> sends goods through a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pipe_(material)" title="Pipe (material)">pipe</a>; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but <a href="/wiki/Pneumatic_tube" title="Pneumatic tube">pneumatic tubes</a> can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Infrastructure">Infrastructure</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></div>

<p>Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a way, a terminal and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be built up. Air and water craft are able to avoid this, since the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Airway" title="Airway">airway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sea_lane" title="Sea lane">seaway</a> do not need to be built up. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.</p>
<p>Terminals such as airports, ports and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders to interchange to take advantage of each mode's advantages. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Airport_rail_link" title="Airport rail link">airport rail links</a> connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are <a href="/wiki/Parking_lot" title="Parking lot">parking lots</a>, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops. For freight, terminals act as <a href="/wiki/Transshipment" title="Transshipment">transshipment</a> points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Transport_finance" title="Transport finance">financing</a> of infrastructure can either be <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">public</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Private_enterprise" title="Private enterprise">private</a>. Transport is often a <a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taxation" title="Taxation">taxation</a>. New infrastructure projects can have high cost, and are often financed through <a href="/wiki/Debt" title="Debt">debt</a>. Many infrastructure owners therefore impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toll_plaza" title="Toll plaza">toll plazas</a> on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose <a href="/wiki/Tax" title="Tax">taxes</a> on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vehicles">Vehicles</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">Vehicle</a></div>

<p>A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">combustion engine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_motor" title="Electric motor">electric motor</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Jet_engine" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Rocket" title="Rocket">rocket</a>, though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through <a href="/wiki/Wheel" title="Wheel">wheels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Propeller" title="Propeller">propellers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a>.</p>
<p>Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a <a href="/wiki/Driving" title="Driving">driver</a>. However, some systems, such as <a href="/wiki/People_mover" title="People mover">people movers</a> and some rapid transits, are fully <a href="/wiki/Automation" title="Automation">automated</a>. For <a href="/wiki/Passenger" title="Passenger">passenger</a> transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Operation">Operation</span></h3>

<p>Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Private_enterprise" title="Private enterprise">private enterprise</a> or by <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">governments</a>. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a <a href="/wiki/Flag_carrier" title="Flag carrier">national airline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Railway_company" title="Railway company">national railway</a>. Since the 1980s, many of these have been <a href="/wiki/Privatization" title="Privatization">privatized</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Functions">Functions</span></h2>
<p>Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport.

<p>Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public</a> and <a href="/wiki/Private_transport" title="Private transport">private transport</a>. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact.

<p>Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of <a href="/wiki/Bus" title="Bus">buses</a> in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and <a href="/wiki/Rapid_transit" title="Rapid transit">rapid transit</a> in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coach_(vehicle)" title="Coach (vehicle)">coaches</a> and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. <a href="/wiki/Intermodal_passenger_transport" title="Intermodal passenger transport">Intermodal passenger transport</a> is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal.

<p>Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the <a href="/wiki/Value_chain" title="Value chain">value chain</a> in manufacturing. With increased specialization and <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a>, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport. Transportation creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen. <a href="/wiki/Logistics" title="Logistics">Logistics</a> refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling and packaging, with associated exchange of information. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incoterm" title="Incoterm">Incoterm</a> deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of <a href="/wiki/Risk" title="Risk">risk</a> during transport.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Containerization" title="Containerization">Containerization</a>, with the standardization of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ISO_container" title="ISO container">ISO containers</a> on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized <a href="/wiki/International" title="International">international</a> and <a href="/wiki/Domestic_trade" title="Domestic trade">domestic trade</a>, offering huge reduction in <a href="/wiki/Transshipment" title="Transshipment">transshipment</a> costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economy_of_scale" title="Economy of scale">economy of scale</a> in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in <a href="/wiki/International_trade" title="International trade">international trade</a> and globalization since the 1950s.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bulk_material_handling" title="Bulk material handling">Bulk transport</a> is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are <a href="/wiki/Ore" title="Ore">ore</a>, coal, cereals and <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cargo_airline" title="Cargo airline">Air freight</a> has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as <a href="/wiki/Postponement" title="Postponement">postponement</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Just_in_time_(business)" title="Just in time (business)">just-in-time</a> within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio. In addition to mail, common items sent by air include <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fashion" title="Fashion">fashion</a> clothing.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_transport" title="History of transport">History of transport</a></div>

<p>Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">vehicles</a>. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to <a href="/wiki/Time_immemorial" title="Time immemorial">time immemorial</a>, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>The first forms of <a href="/wiki/Road_transport" title="Road transport">road transport</a> involved animals, such as <a href="/wiki/Horse" title="Horse">horses</a> (<a href="/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse" title="Domestication of the horse">domesticated</a> in the 4th or 3rd millennium BCE), <a href="/wiki/Ox" title="Ox">oxen</a> (from about 8000 BCE) or humans carrying goods over <a href="/wiki/Dirt" title="Dirt">dirt</a> tracks that often followed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Game_(food)" title="Game (food)">game</a> <a href="/wiki/Trail" title="Trail">trails</a>. Many early civilizations, including <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>, constructed paved roads. In <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" title="Classical antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval <a href="/wiki/Caliphate" title="Caliphate">Caliphate</a> later built <a href="/wiki/Tarmac" title="Tarmac">tar-paved</a> roads. The first watercraft were <a href="/wiki/Canoe" title="Canoe">canoes</a> cut out from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tree_trunk" title="Tree trunk">tree trunks</a>. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the <a href="/wiki/Wind" title="Wind">wind</a> for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With <a href="/wiki/Telegraphy" title="Telegraphy">telegraphy</a>, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a>, closely followed by its application in <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport" title="Rail transport">rail transport</a>, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased rapidly, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Steam_ship" title="Steam ship">steam ship</a>, which sped up global transport.</p>
<p>With the development of the <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">combustion engine</a> and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first "modern" highways were constructed during the 19th century with <a href="/wiki/Macadam" title="Macadam">macadam</a>. Later, <a href="/wiki/Tarmac" title="Tarmac">tarmac</a> and <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the <a href="/wiki/Wright_brothers" title="Wright brothers">Wright brothers</a> demonstrated the first successful controllable <a href="/wiki/Airplane" title="Airplane">airplane</a>, and after World War I (1914-1918)aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.</p>
<p>After World War II (1939-1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services. Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Containerization" title="Containerization">containerization</a> gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a>. International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the <a href="/wiki/Jet_engine" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a>. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Shinkansen" title="Shinkansen">Shinkansen</a> in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from airlines.</p>
<p>Early in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._history" title="U.S. history">U.S. history</a>, <a href="/wiki/Privately_held_company" title="Privately held company">private</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joint-stock" title="Joint-stock">joint-stock</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corporations" title="Corporations">corporations</a> owned most <a href="/wiki/Navigable_aqueduct" title="Navigable aqueduct">aqueducts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bridge" title="Bridge">bridges</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canals" title="Canals">canals</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Railroads" title="Railroads">railroads</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roads" title="Roads">roads</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tunnels" title="Tunnels">tunnels</a>. Most such transportation infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the <a href="/wiki/Nationalization" title="Nationalization">nationalization</a> of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>. Recently, however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and adherents.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic">Economic</span></h3>

<p>Transport is a key necessity for <a href="/wiki/Departmentalization" title="Departmentalization">specialization</a>—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations. Transport has throughout history been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> and a greater spread of people. <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">Economic growth</a> has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport. But the infrastructure and operation of transport has a great impact on the land and is the largest drainer of energy, making <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transport_sustainability" title="Transport sustainability">transport sustainability</a> a major issue.</p>
<p>Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of <a href="/wiki/Tourism" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, a major part of <a href="/wiki/Recreation" title="Recreation">recreational</a> transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Planning">Planning</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transport_planning" title="Transport planning">Transport planning</a></div>
<p>Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transport_forecasting" title="Transport forecasting">transport forecasting</a>, planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the <a href="/wiki/Supply_chain" title="Supply chain">supply chain</a>. Transport as a field is also studied through <a href="/wiki/Transport_economics" title="Transport economics">transport economics</a>, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transport_engineering" title="Transport engineering">Transport engineering</a>, a sub-discipline of <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a>, must take into account <a href="/wiki/Trip_generation" title="Trip generation">trip generation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trip_distribution" title="Trip distribution">trip distribution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mode_choice" title="Mode choice">mode choice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Route_assignment" title="Route assignment">route assignment</a>, while the operative level is handled through <a href="/wiki/Traffic_engineering_(transportation)" title="Traffic engineering (transportation)">traffic engineering</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a <a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>, where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. <a href="/wiki/Land_use" title="Land use">Density of development</a> depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration" title="Economies of agglomeration">economies of agglomeration</a>. Beyond transportation some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transportation facilities consume land, and in cities, pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.</p>
<p>Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput means that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places, and as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociologists as well as economists—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.</p>

<p>Transport is a major use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_(society)" title="Energy (society)">energy</a> and burns most of the world's <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>.

By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_regulation" title="Environmental regulation">Environmental regulations</a> in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle. Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.
