The term, artificial photosynthesis, is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a <a href="/wiki/Solar_fuel" title="Solar fuel">solar fuel</a>). <a href="/wiki/Photocatalytic_water_splitting" title="Photocatalytic water splitting">Photocatalytic water splitting</a> converts water into <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> ions and oxygen, and is a main research area in artificial photosynthesis. <a href="/wiki/Photochemical_carbon_dioxide_reduction" title="Photochemical carbon dioxide reduction">Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction</a> is another studied process, that replicates natural <a href="/wiki/Carbon_fixation" title="Carbon fixation">carbon fixation</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two <a href="/wiki/Half-reaction" title="Half-reaction">half-reactions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">oxidation and reduction</a>, both of which are essential to producing <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a>. In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second stage of plant photosynthesis (also known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calvin-Benson_cycle" title="Calvin-Benson cycle">Calvin-Benson cycle</a>) is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light-independent_reaction" title="Light-independent reaction">light-independent reaction</a> that converts carbon dioxide into <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> (fuel). Researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photocatalyst" title="Photocatalyst">photocatalysts</a> that are able to perform both of these reactions. Furthermore, the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production. These <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalysts</a> must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident solar <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photons" title="Photons">photons</a>.</p>

<p>Whereas <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a> can provide energy directly from sunlight, the inefficiency of fuel production from photovoltaic electricity (indirect process) and the fact that sunshine is not constant throughout the day sets a limit to its use. One way of using natural photosynthesis is via the production of a <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>, which is an indirect process that suffers from low energy conversion efficiency (due to photosynthesis' own low efficiency in converting sunlight to biomass), the cost of harvesting and transporting the fuel, and clashes with the increasing need of land mass for food production. Artificial photosynthesis aims then to produce a fuel from sunlight that can be conveniently stored and used when sunlight is not available, by using direct processes, that is, to produce a <a href="/wiki/Solar_fuel" title="Solar fuel">solar fuel</a>. With the development of catalysts able to reproduce the key steps of photosynthesis, water and sunlight would ultimately be the only needed sources for clean energy production. The only by-product would be oxygen, and production of a solar fuel has the potential to be cheaper than gasoline.</p>
<p>One process for the creation of a clean and affordable energy supply is the development of <a href="/wiki/Photocatalytic_water_splitting" title="Photocatalytic water splitting">photocatalytic water splitting</a> under solar light. This method of sustainable hydrogen production is a key objective in the development of <a href="/wiki/Alternative_energy" title="Alternative energy">alternative energy</a> systems. It is also predicted to be one of the more, if not the most, efficient ways of obtaining hydrogen from water. The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen via a water-splitting process assisted by photosemiconductor catalysts is one of the most promising technologies in development. This process has the potential for large quantities of hydrogen to be generated in an ecologically sound manner. The conversion of solar energy into a clean fuel (H<sub>2</sub>) under ambient conditions is one of the greatest challenges facing scientists in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Two approaches are generally recognized in the construction of solar fuel cells for hydrogen production:</p>
<ul>
<li>A homogeneous system is one where catalysts are not <a href="/wiki/Compartmentalization_(engineering)" title="Compartmentalization (engineering)">compartmentalized</a>, that is, components are present in the same compartment. This means that hydrogen and oxygen are produced in the same location. This can be a drawback, since they compose an explosive mixture, demanding gas product separation. Also, all components must be active in approximately the same conditions (e.g., <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a>).</li>
<li>A heterogeneous system has two separate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrodes" title="Electrodes">electrodes</a>, an anode and a cathode, making possible the separation of oxygen and hydrogen production. Furthermore, different components do not necessarily need to work in the same conditions. However, the increased complexity of these systems makes them harder to develop and more expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another area of research within artificial photosynthesis is the selection and manipulation of photosynthetic microorganisms, namely green <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microalgae" title="Microalgae">microalgae</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cyanobacteria" title="Cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, for the production of solar fuels. Many <a href="/wiki/Strain_(biology)" title="Strain (biology)">strains</a> are able to produce hydrogen naturally, and scientists are working to improve them. <a href="/wiki/Algae_fuel" title="Algae fuel">Algae biofuels</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Butanol" title="Butanol">butanol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Methanol" title="Methanol">methanol</a> are produced both at laboratory and commercial scales. This approach has benefited from the development of <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_biology" title="Synthetic biology">synthetic biology</a>, which is also being explored by the <a href="/wiki/J._Craig_Venter_Institute" title="J. Craig Venter Institute">J. Craig Venter Institute</a> to produce a synthetic organism capable of biofuel production.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The artificial photosynthesis was first anticipated by the Italian chemist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Giacomo_Ciamician" title="Giacomo Ciamician">Giacomo Ciamician</a> in 1912. In a lecture that was later published in <a href="/wiki/Science_(journal)" title="Science (journal)">Science</a> he proposed a switch from the use of <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> to radiant energy provided by the sun and captured by technical photochemistry devices. In this switch he saw a possibility to close the gap between the rich north and poor south and ventured a guess that this switch from <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> to <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> would "not be harmful to the progress and to human happiness."</p>
<p>In the late 60s, <a href="/wiki/Akira_Fujishima" title="Akira Fujishima">Akira Fujishima</a> discovered the photocatalytic properties of <a href="/wiki/Titanium_dioxide" title="Titanium dioxide">titanium dioxide</a>, the so-called Honda-Fujishima effect, which could be used for <a href="/wiki/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>.</p>
<p>The Swedish Consortium for Artificial Photosynthesis, the first of its kind, was established in 1994 as a collaboration between groups of three different universities, <a href="/wiki/Lund_University" title="Lund University">Lund</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uppsala_University" title="Uppsala University">Uppsala</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stockholm_University" title="Stockholm University">Stockholm</a>, being presently active around <a href="/wiki/Lund" title="Lund">Lund</a> and the Ångström Laboratories in Uppsala. The consortium was built with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multidisciplinary" title="Multidisciplinary">multidisciplinary</a> approach to focus on learning from natural photosynthesis and applying this knowledge in biomimetic systems.</p>
<p>Research into artificial photosynthesis is undergoing a boom at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2000, <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" title="Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO) researchers publicized their intent to focus on carbon dioxide capture and its conversion to hydrocarbons. In 2003, the <a href="/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory" title="Brookhaven National Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> announced the discovery of an important intermediate step in the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO (the simplest possible carbon dioxide reduction reaction), which could lead to better catalysts.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of artificial systems for water-splitting catalysts is their general reliance on scarce, expensive elements, such as ruthenium or rhenium. In 2008, with the funding of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Office_of_Aerospace_Research_and_Development" title="European Office of Aerospace Research and Development">United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT" title="MIT">MIT</a> chemist and head of the Solar Revolution Project <a href="/wiki/Daniel_G._Nocera" title="Daniel G. Nocera">Daniel G. Nocera</a> and postdoctoral fellow Matthew Kanan attempted to circumvent this issue by using a catalyst containing the cheaper and more abundant elements cobalt and phosphate. The catalyst was able to split water into oxygen and protons using sunlight, and could potentially be coupled to a hydrogen gas producing catalyst such as platinum. Furthermore, while the catalyst broke down during catalysis, it could self-repair. This experimental catalyst design was considered a major breakthrough in the field by many researchers.</p>
<p>Whereas CO is the prime reduction product of CO<sub>2</sub>, more complex carbon compounds are usually desired. In 2008, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_B._Bocarsly" title="Andrew B. Bocarsly">Andrew B. Bocarsly</a> reported the direct conversion of carbon dioxide and water to methanol using solar energy in a highly efficient photochemical cell.</p>
<p>While Nocera and coworkers had accomplished water splitting to oxygen and protons, a light-driven process to produce hydrogen is desirable. In 2009, the Leibniz Institute for Catalysis reported inexpensive iron carbonyl complexes able to do just that. In the same year, researchers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia" title="University of East Anglia">University of East Anglia</a> also used iron carbonyl compounds to achieve photoelectrochemical hydrogen production with 60% efficiency, this time using a gold electrode covered with layers of <a href="/wiki/Indium_phosphide" title="Indium phosphide">indium phosphide</a> to which the iron complexes were linked. Both of these processes used a molecular approach, where discrete nanoparticles are responsible for catalysis.</p>
<p>Visible light water splitting with a one piece multijunction cell was first demonstrated and patented by William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices in 1983. This group demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen, now referred to as an "artificial leaf" or "wireless solar water splitting" with a low cost, thin film amorphous silicon multijunction cell directly immersed in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved from the back metal substrate which also eliminated the hazard of mixed hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution. A Nafion membrane above the immersed cell provided a path for proton transport. The higher photovoltage available from the multijuction thin film cell with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with UV sensitive single junction cells. The group's patent also lists several other semiconductor multijunction compositions in addition to amorphous silicon.</p>
<p>In 2009, F. del Valle and K. Domen showed the impact of the thermal treatment in a closed atmosphere using Cd1-xZnxS photocatalysts. Cd1-xZnxS <a href="/wiki/Solid_solution" title="Solid solution">solid solution</a> reports high activity in hydrogen production from water splitting under sunlight irradiation. A mixed heterogeneous/molecular approach by researchers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz" title="University of California, Santa Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, in 2010, using both nitrogen-<a href="/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)" title="Doping (semiconductor)">doped</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cadmium_selenide" title="Cadmium selenide">cadmium selenide</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quantum_dots" title="Quantum dots">quantum dots</a>-sensitized titanium dioxide <a href="/wiki/Nanoparticle" title="Nanoparticle">nanoparticles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nanowire" title="Nanowire">nanowires</a>, also yielded photoproduced hydrogen.</p>
<p>Artificial photosynthesis remained an academic field for many years. However, in the beginning of 2009, <a href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_Chemical_Holdings" title="Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings">Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings</a> was reported to be developing its own artificial photosynthesis research by using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to "create the carbon building blocks from which resins, plastics and fibers can be synthesized." This was confirmed with the establishment of the KAITEKI Institute later that year, with carbon dioxide reduction through artificial photosynthesis as one of the main goals.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">DOE</a> established, as one of its <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy#Energy_Innovation_Hubs" title="United States Department of Energy">Energy Innovation Hubs</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Center_for_Artificial_Photosynthesis" title="Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis">Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis</a>. The mission of JCAP is to find a cost-effective method to produce fuels using only sunlight, water, and carbon-dioxide as inputs.  JCAP is led by a team from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caltech" title="Caltech">Caltech</a>, led by Professor <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Lewis" title="Nathan Lewis">Nathan Lewis</a> and brings together more than 120 scientists and engineers from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caltech" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> and its lead partner, <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" title="Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. JCAP also draws on the expertise and capabilities of key partners from <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_California_at_Berkeley" title="University of California at Berkeley">University of California at Berkeley</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UCSB" title="UCSB">UCSB</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine" title="University of California, Irvine">UCI</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UCSD" title="UCSD">UCSD</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stanford_Linear_Accelerator" title="Stanford Linear Accelerator">Stanford Linear Accelerator</a>.  In addition, JCAP serves as a central hub for other solar fuels research teams across the United States, including 20 DOE Energy Frontier Research Center.  The program has a budget of $122M over five years, subject to Congressional appropriation</p>
<p>Also in 2010, a team led by professor <a href="/wiki/David_Wendell" title="David Wendell">David Wendell</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati" title="University of Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a> successfully demonstrated photosynthesis in an artificial construct consisting of enzymes suspended in a foam housing.</p>
<p>In 2011, Daniel Nocera and his research team announced the creation of the first practical artificial leaf. In a speech at the 241st National Meeting of the <a href="/wiki/American_Chemical_Society" title="American Chemical Society">American Chemical Society</a>, Nocera described an advanced solar cell the size of a poker card capable of splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen, approximately ten times more efficient than natural photosynthesis. The cell is mostly made of inexpensive materials that are widely available, works under simple conditions, and shows increased stability over previous catalysts: in laboratory studies, the authors demonstrated that an artificial leaf prototype could operate continuously for at least forty-five hours without a drop in activity. In May 2012, Sun Catalytix, the startup based on Nocera's research, stated that it will not be scaling up the prototype as the device offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight. Leading experts in the field have supported a proposal for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis as a combined energy security and climate change solution. Conferences on this theme have been held at Lord Howe Island in 2011, at Chicheley Hall in the UK in 2014 and at Canberra and Lord Howe island in 2016.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_research">Current research</span></h2>
<p>In energy terms, natural photosynthesis can be divided in three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Light-harvesting_complex" title="Light-harvesting complex">Light-harvesting complexes</a> in bacteria and plants capture photons and transduce them into electrons, injecting them into the photosynthetic chain.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Proton-coupled_electron_transfer" title="Proton-coupled electron transfer">Proton-coupled electron transfer</a> along several cofactors of the photosynthetic chain, causing local, spatial <a href="/wiki/Photoinduced_charge_separation" title="Photoinduced charge separation">charge separation</a>.</li>
<li>Redox catalysis, which uses the aforementioned transferred electrons to oxidize water to dioxygen and protons; these protons can in some species be utilized for <a href="/wiki/Biohydrogen" title="Biohydrogen">dihydrogen production</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biomimetic" title="Biomimetic">biomimetic</a> approaches, artificial photosynthesis tries to construct systems doing the same type of processes. Ideally, a <a href="/wiki/Catalytic_triad" title="Catalytic triad">triad</a> assembly could oxidize water with one catalyst, reduce protons with another and have a <a href="/wiki/Photosensitizer" title="Photosensitizer">photosensitizer</a> molecule to power the whole system. One of the simplest designs is where the photosensitizer is linked in tandem between a water oxidation catalyst and a hydrogen evolving catalyst:</p>
<ul>
<li>The photosensitizer transfers electrons to the hydrogen catalyst when hit by light, becoming oxidized in the process.</li>
<li>This drives the water splitting catalyst to donate electrons to the photosensitizer. In a triad assembly, such a catalyst is often referred to as a donor. The oxidized donor is able to perform water oxidation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The state of the triad with one catalyst oxidized on one end and the second one reduced on the other end of the triad is referred to as a charge separation, and is a driving force for further electron transfer, and consequently catalysis, to occur. The different components may be assembled in diverse ways, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supramolecular" title="Supramolecular">supramolecular</a> complexes, compartmentalized cells, or linearly, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Covalent" title="Covalent">covalently</a> linked molecules.</p>
<p>Research into finding catalysts that can convert water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to carbohydrates or hydrogen is a current, active field. By studying the natural <a href="/wiki/Oxygen-evolving_complex" title="Oxygen-evolving complex">oxygen-evolving complex</a> (OEC), researchers have developed catalysts such as the "blue dimer" to mimic its function or inorganic-based materials such as Birnessite with the similar building block as the OEC. <a href="/wiki/Photoelectrochemical_cell" title="Photoelectrochemical cell">Photoelectrochemical cells</a> that reduce carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) are under development. However, these catalysts are still very inefficient.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogen_catalysts">Hydrogen catalysts</span></h3>
<p>Hydrogen is the simplest solar fuel to synthesize, since it involves only the transference of two electrons to two protons. It must, however, be done stepwise, with formation of an intermediate <a href="/wiki/Hydride" title="Hydride">hydride</a> anion:</p>

<p>The proton-to-hydrogen converting catalysts present in nature are <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenase" title="Hydrogenase">hydrogenases</a>. These are <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> that can either reduce protons to molecular hydrogen or oxidize hydrogen to protons and electrons. <a href="/wiki/Spectroscopy" title="Spectroscopy">Spectroscopic</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protein_crystallography" title="Protein crystallography">crystallographic</a> studies spanning several decades have resulted in a good understanding of both the structure and mechanism of hydrogenase catalysis. Using this information, several molecules <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenase_mimic" title="Hydrogenase mimic">mimicking</a> the structure of the active site of both <a href="/wiki/Nickel-dependent_hydrogenase" title="Nickel-dependent hydrogenase">nickel-iron</a> and iron-iron hydrogenases have been synthesized. Other catalysts are not structural mimics of hydrogenase but rather functional ones. Synthesized catalysts include structural H-cluster models, a dirhodium photocatalyst, and <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> catalysts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water-oxidizing_catalysts">Water-oxidizing catalysts</span></h3>
<p>Water oxidation is a more complex chemical reaction than proton reduction. In nature, the <a href="/wiki/Oxygen-evolving_complex" title="Oxygen-evolving complex">oxygen-evolving complex</a> performs this reaction by accumulating reducing equivalents (electrons) in a manganese-calcium cluster within <a href="/wiki/Photosystem_II" title="Photosystem II">photosystem II</a> (PS II), then delivering them to water molecules, with the resulting production of molecular oxygen and protons:</p>

<p>Without a catalyst (natural or artificial), <a href="/wiki/Heterogeneous_water_oxidation" title="Heterogeneous water oxidation">this reaction</a> is very endothermic, requiring high temperatures (at least 2500 K).</p>
<p>The exact structure of the oxygen-evolving complex has been hard to determine experimentally. As of 2011, the most detailed model was from a 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of photosystem II. The complex is a <a href="/wiki/Cluster_chemistry" title="Cluster chemistry">cluster</a> containing four <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a> and one <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> ions, but the exact location and mechanism of water oxidation within the cluster is unknown. Nevertheless, bio-inspired manganese and manganese-calcium complexes have been synthesized, such as [Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>] <a href="/wiki/Cubane-type_cluster" title="Cubane-type cluster">cubane-type clusters</a>, some with catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium" title="Ruthenium">ruthenium</a> complexes, such as the dinuclear µ-oxo-bridged "blue dimer" (the first of its kind to be synthesized), are capable of light-driven water oxidation, thanks to being able to form high <a href="/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)" title="Valence (chemistry)">valence</a> states. In this case, the ruthenium complex acts as both photosensitizer and catalyst.</p>
<p>Many metal oxides have been found to have water oxidation catalytic activity, including <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium(IV)_oxide" title="Ruthenium(IV) oxide">ruthenium(IV) oxide</a> (RuO<sub>2</sub>), iridium(IV) oxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>), cobalt oxides (including <a href="/wiki/Nickel" title="Nickel">nickel</a>-<a href="/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)" title="Doping (semiconductor)">doped</a> <a href="/wiki/Cobalt(II,III)_oxide" title="Cobalt(II,III) oxide">Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></a>), <a href="/wiki/Manganese_oxide" title="Manganese oxide">manganese oxide</a> (including layered MnO<sub>2</sub> (birnessite), Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and a mix of Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with CaMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Oxides are easier to obtain than molecular catalysts, especially those from relatively abundant transition metals (cobalt and manganese), but suffer from low <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turnover_frequency" title="Turnover frequency">turnover frequency</a> and slow <a href="/wiki/Electron_transfer" title="Electron transfer">electron transfer</a> properties, and their mechanism of action is hard to decipher and, therefore, to adjust.</p>
<p>Recently <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metal-Organic_Framework" title="Metal-Organic Framework">Metal-Organic Framework</a> (MOF)-based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water oxidation with first row transition metals. The stability and tunability of this system is projected to be highly beneficial for future development.</p>

<p>Nature uses <a href="/wiki/Biological_pigment" title="Biological pigment">pigments</a>, mainly <a href="/wiki/Chlorophyll" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophylls</a>, to absorb a broad part of the visible spectrum. Artificial systems can use either one type of pigment with a broad absorption range or combine several pigments for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Ruthenium <a href="/wiki/Polypyridine_complex" title="Polypyridine complex">polypyridine complexes</a>, in particular <a href="/wiki/Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)_chloride" title="Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride">tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)</a> and its derivatives, have been extensively used in hydrogen photoproduction due to their efficient visible light absorption and long-lived consequent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MLCT" title="MLCT">metal-to-ligand charge transfer</a> <a href="/wiki/Excited_state" title="Excited state">excited state</a>, which makes the complexes strong reducing agents.

<p>Metal-free organic complexes have also been successfully employed as photosensitizers. Examples include <a href="/wiki/Eosin_Y" title="Eosin Y">eosin Y</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rose_bengal" title="Rose bengal">rose bengal</a>.

<p>As part of current research efforts artificial photonic antenna systems are being studied to determine efficient and sustainable ways to collect light for artificial photosynthesis. Gion Calzaferri (2009) describes one such antenna that uses zeolite L as a host for organic dyes, to mimic plant's light collecting systems. The material may be interfaced to an external device via a stopcock intermediate.</p>

<p>Artificial CO<sub>2</sub> reduction for fuel production aims mostly at producing reduced carbon compounds from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Some <a href="/wiki/Transition_metal" title="Transition metal">transition metal</a> <a href="/wiki/Phosphine" title="Phosphine">polyphosphine</a> complexes have been developed for this end; however, they usually require previous concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> before use, and carriers (molecules that would fixate CO<sub>2</sub>) that are both stable in aerobic conditions and able to concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> at atmospheric concentrations haven't been yet developed. The simplest product from CO<sub>2</sub> reduction is <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), but for fuel development, further reduction is needed, and a key step also needing further development is the transfer of hydride anions to CO.</p>

<p>Since photodamage is usually a consequence in many of the tested systems after a period of exposure to light, bio-inspired photoprotectants have been tested, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carotenoids" title="Carotenoids">carotenoids</a> (which are used in photosynthesis as natural protectants).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Photoelectrochemical_cell" title="Photoelectrochemical cell">Photoelectrochemical cell</a></div>
<p>Photoelectrochemical cells are a heterogeneous system that use light to produce either electricity or hydrogen. The vast majority of photoelectrochemical cells use semiconductors as catalysts. There have been attempts to use synthetic manganese complex-impregnated <a href="/wiki/Nafion" title="Nafion">Nafion</a> as a working electrode, but it has been since shown that the catalytically active species is actually the broken-down complex.</p>
<p>A promising, emerging type of solar cell is the <a href="/wiki/Dye-sensitized_solar_cell" title="Dye-sensitized solar cell">dye-sensitized solar cell</a>. This type of cell still depends on a semiconductor (such as TiO<sub>2</sub>) for current conduction on one electrode, but with a coating of an organic or inorganic dye that acts as a photosensitizer; the counter electrode is a platinum catalyst for H<sub>2</sub> production. These cells have a self-repair mechanism and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies rivaling those of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solid_state_(electronics)" title="Solid state (electronics)">solid-state</a> semiconductor ones.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Photocatalytic_water_splitting_in_homogeneous_systems">Photocatalytic water splitting in homogeneous systems</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Photocatalytic_water_splitting" title="Photocatalytic water splitting">Photocatalytic water splitting</a></div>
<p>Direct water oxidation by photocatalysts is a more efficient usage of solar energy than <a href="/wiki/Photoelectrochemical_cell" title="Photoelectrochemical cell">photoelectrochemical</a> water splitting because it avoids an intermediate thermal or electrical energy conversion step.</p>
<p>Bio-inspired manganese clusters have been shown to possess water oxidation activity when <a href="/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">adsorbed</a> on <a href="/wiki/Clay" title="Clay">clays</a> together with ruthenium photosensitizers, although with low turnover numbers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, some ruthenium complexes are able to oxidize water under solar light irradiation. Although their photostability is still an issue, many can be reactivated by a simple adjustment of the conditions they work in. Improvement of catalyst stability has been tried resorting to <a href="/wiki/Polyoxometalate" title="Polyoxometalate">polyoxometalates</a>, in particular ruthenium-based ones.</p>
<p>Whereas a fully functional artificial system is usually envisioned when constructing a water splitting device, some mixed approaches have been tried. One of these involve the use of a <a href="/wiki/Working_electrode" title="Working electrode">gold electrode</a> to which photosystem II is linked; an electric current is detected upon illumination.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogen-producing_artificial_systems">Hydrogen-producing artificial systems</span></h3>

<p>The simplest photocatalytic hydrogen production unit consists of a hydrogen-evolving catalyst linked to a photosensitizer. In this <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dyad" title="wikt:dyad">dyad</a> assembly, a so-called sacrificial donor for the photosensitizer is needed, that is, one that is externally supplied and replenished; the photosensitizer donates the necessary reducing equivalents to the hydrogen-evolving catalyst, which uses protons from a solution where it is immersed or dissolved in. Cobalt compounds such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cobaloximes" title="Cobaloximes">cobaloximes</a> are some of the best hydrogen catalysts, having been coupled to both metal-containing and metal-free photosensitizers. The first H-cluster models linked to photosensitizers (mostly ruthenium photosensitizers, but also porphyrin-derived ones) were prepared in the early 2000s. Both types of assembly are under development to improve their stability and increase their <a href="/wiki/Turnover_number" title="Turnover number">turnover numbers</a>, both necessary for constructing a sturdy, long-lived solar fuel cell.</p>
<p>As with water oxidation catalysis, not only fully artificial systems have been idealized: hydrogenase enzymes themselves have been engineered for photoproduction of hydrogen, by coupling the enzyme to an artificial photosensitizer, such as [Ru(bipy)<sub>3</sub>] or even <a href="/wiki/Photosystem_I" title="Photosystem I">photosystem I</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="NADP.2B.2FNADPH_coenzyme-inspired_catalyst">NADP/NADPH coenzyme-inspired catalyst</span></h3>
<p>In natural photosynthesis, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NADPH" title="NADPH">NADP</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coenzyme" title="Coenzyme">coenzyme</a> is reducible to NADPH through binding of a <a href="/wiki/Proton" title="Proton">proton</a> and two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrons" title="Electrons">electrons</a>. This reduced form can then deliver the proton and electrons, potentially as a <a href="/wiki/Hydride" title="Hydride">hydride</a>, to reactions that culminate in the production of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbohydrates" title="Carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a> (the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calvin_cycle" title="Calvin cycle">Calvin cycle</a>). The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coenzyme" title="Coenzyme">coenzyme</a> is recyclable in a natural photosynthetic cycle, but this process is yet to be artificially replicated.</p>
<p>A current goal is to obtain an NADPH-inspired catalyst capable of recreating the natural cyclic process. Utilizing light, <a href="/wiki/Hydride" title="Hydride">hydride</a> donors would be regenerated and produced where the molecules are continuously used in a closed cycle. Brookhaven chemists are now using a <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium" title="Ruthenium">ruthenium</a>-based complex to serve as the acting model. The complex is proven to perform correspondingly with NADP+/NADPH, behaving as the foundation for the proton and two electrons needed to convert <a href="/wiki/Acetone" title="Acetone">acetone</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isopropanol" title="Isopropanol">isopropanol</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, Brookhaven researchers are aiming to find ways for light to generate the hydride donors. The general idea is to use this process to produce fuels from <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Photobiological_production_of_fuels">Photobiological production of fuels</span></h3>
<p>Some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photoautotrophic" title="Photoautotrophic">photoautotrophic</a> microorganisms can, under certain conditions, produce hydrogen. <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation" title="Nitrogen fixation">Nitrogen-fixing</a> microorganisms, such as filamentous <a href="/wiki/Cyanobacteria" title="Cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, possess the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Nitrogenase" title="Nitrogenase">nitrogenase</a>, responsible for conversion of atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> into <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>; molecular hydrogen is a byproduct of this reaction, and is many times not released by the microorganism, but rather taken up by a hydrogen-oxidizing (uptake) hydrogenase. One way of forcing these organisms to produce hydrogen is then to annihilate uptake hydrogenase activity. This has been done on a strain of <i><a href="/wiki/Nostoc_punctiforme" title="Nostoc punctiforme">Nostoc punctiforme</a></i>: one of the <a href="/wiki/Structural_gene" title="Structural gene">structural genes</a> of the NiFe uptake hydrogenase was inactivated by <a href="/wiki/Insertional_mutagenesis" title="Insertional mutagenesis">insertional mutagenesis</a>, and the mutant strain showed hydrogen evolution under illumination.</p>
<p>Many of these photoautotrophs also have bidirectional hydrogenases, which can produce hydrogen under certain conditions. However, other energy-demanding <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_pathway" title="Metabolic pathway">metabolic pathways</a> can compete with the necessary electrons for proton reduction, decreasing the efficiency of the overall process; also, these hydrogenases are very sensitive to oxygen.</p>
<p>Several carbon-based biofuels have also been produced using cyanobacteria, such as 1-butanol.</p>
<p>Synthetic biology techniques are predicted to be useful in this field. Microbiological and enzymatic engineering have the potential of improving enzyme efficiency and robustness, as well as constructing new biofuel-producing metabolic pathways in photoautotrophs that previously lack them, or improving on the existing ones. Another field under development is the optimization of <a href="/wiki/Photobioreactor" title="Photobioreactor">photobioreactors</a> for commercial application.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Employed_research_techniques">Employed research techniques</span></h2>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Advantages.2C_disadvantages.2C_and_efficiency">Advantages, disadvantages, and efficiency</span></h2>
<p>Advantages of solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The solar energy can be immediately converted and stored. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> cells, sunlight is converted into electricity and then converted again into chemical energy for storage, with some necessary loss of energy associated with the second conversion.</li>
<li>The byproducts of these reactions are environmentally friendly. Artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon-neutral" title="Carbon-neutral">carbon-neutral</a> source of energy, which could be used for transportation or homes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Materials used for artificial photosynthesis often corrode in water, so they may be less stable than <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a> over long periods of time. Most hydrogen catalysts are very sensitive to oxygen, being inactivated or degraded in its presence; also, photodamage may occur over time.</li>
<li>The overall cost is not yet advantageous enough to compete with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a> as a commercially viable source of energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>A concern usually addressed in catalyst design is efficiency, in particular how much of the incident light can be used in a system in practice. This is comparable with <a href="/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency" title="Photosynthetic efficiency">photosynthetic efficiency</a>, where light-to-chemical-energy conversion is measured. Photosynthetic organisms are able to collect about 50% of incident solar radiation, however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0% for C3 and C4 plants respectively. In reality, the efficiency of photosynthesis is much lower and is usually below 1%, with some exceptions such as <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a> in tropical climate. In contrast, the highest reported efficiency for artificial photosynthesis lab prototypes is 22.4%. However, plants are efficient in using CO<sub>2</sub> at atmospheric concentrations, something that artificial catalysts still cannot perform.</p>
