<p>From 1946, the <a href="/wiki/National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics" title="National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic <a href="/wiki/Bell_X-1" title="Bell X-1">Bell X-1</a>. In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the <a href="/wiki/International_Geophysical_Year" title="International Geophysical Year">International Geophysical Year</a> (1957–58). An effort for this was the American <a href="/wiki/Project_Vanguard" title="Project Vanguard">Project Vanguard</a>. After the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_space_program" title="Soviet space program">Soviet</a> launch of the world's first artificial <a href="/wiki/Satellite" title="Satellite">satellite</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Sputnik_1" title="Sputnik 1">Sputnik 1</a></i>) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">US Congress</a>, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "<a href="/wiki/Sputnik_crisis" title="Sputnik crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>"), urged immediate and swift action; President <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. This led to an agreement that a new federal agency mainly based on NACA was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space. The <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (ARPA) was created in February 1958 to develop space technology for military application.</p>
<p>On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the <a href="/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Act" title="National Aeronautics and Space Act">National Aeronautics and Space Act</a>, establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 43-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 million, three major research laboratories (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Langley_Aeronautical_Laboratory" title="Langley Aeronautical Laboratory">Langley Aeronautical Laboratory</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ames_Aeronautical_Laboratory" title="Ames Aeronautical Laboratory">Ames Aeronautical Laboratory</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lewis_Flight_Propulsion_Laboratory" title="Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory">Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory</a>) and two small test facilities.

<p>NASA has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history. Unmanned programs launched the first American artificial <a href="/wiki/Satellite" title="Satellite">satellites</a> into Earth orbit for scientific and <a href="/wiki/Communications_satellite" title="Communications satellite">communications</a> purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, and including "<a href="/wiki/Voyager_program" title="Voyager program">grand tours</a>" of the outer planets.

Some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects, such as the Galileo probe, which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent unmanned to Jupiter.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manned_programs">Manned programs</span></h3>
<p>The experimental <a href="/wiki/Rocket-powered_aircraft" title="Rocket-powered aircraft">rocket-powered aircraft</a> programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man <a href="/wiki/Space_capsule" title="Space capsule">space capsule</a> program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and <a href="/wiki/National_security" title="National security">security</a> fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, in 1961 President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> proposed the ambitious goal "of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth." This goal was met in 1969 by the <a href="/wiki/Apollo_program" title="Apollo program">Apollo program</a>, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars" title="Manned mission to Mars">manned mission to Mars</a>. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital <a href="/wiki/Space_station" title="Space station">space station</a> in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/X-15" title="X-15">X-15</a> rocket flights above the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">USAF</a> definition of spaceflight altitude, 260,000 feet (80 km).</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/North_American_X-15" title="North American X-15">X-15</a> was an NACA experimental rocket-powered <a href="/wiki/Hypersonic_speed" title="Hypersonic speed">hypersonic</a> research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RFP" title="RFP">Requests for proposal</a> were issued on December 30, 1954 for the airframe, and February 4, 1955 for the rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to <a href="/wiki/North_American_Aviation" title="North American Aviation">North American Aviation</a> in November 1955, and the XLR30 engine contract was awarded to <a href="/wiki/Reaction_Motors" title="Reaction Motors">Reaction Motors</a> in 1956, and three planes were built. The X-15 was <a href="/wiki/Drop_test" title="Drop test">drop-launched</a> from the wing of one of two NASA <a href="/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress" title="Boeing B-52 Stratofortress">Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses</a>, <i>NB52A</i> tail number 52-003, and <i>NB52B</i>, tail number 52-008 (known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Balls_8" title="Balls 8">Balls 8</a></i>). Release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet (14 km) and a speed of about 500 miles per hour (805 km/h).</p>
<p>Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA (later NASA). A total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968, resulting in the <a href="/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record" title="Flight airspeed record">official world record</a> for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft (current as of 2014), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 km/h). The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km). Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Astronaut_Badge" title="Astronaut Badge">astronaut wings</a> for flying above 260,000 feet (80 km), and two flights by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_A._Walker" title="Joseph A.

<p>Shortly after the <a href="/wiki/Space_Race" title="Space Race">Space Race</a> began, an early objective was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. The US Air Force's <a href="/wiki/Man_in_Space_Soonest" title="Man in Space Soonest">Man in Space Soonest</a> program considered many manned spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic <a href="/wiki/Space_capsule" title="Space capsule">space capsules</a>. By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule.</p>
<p>When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred to it and renamed <i>Project Mercury</i>. The <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Seven" title="Mercury Seven">first seven astronauts</a> were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut <a href="/wiki/Alan_Shepard" title="Alan Shepard">Alan Shepard</a> became the first American in space aboard <i><a href="/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_3" title="Mercury-Redstone 3">Freedom 7</a></i>, launched by a <a href="/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_Launch_Vehicle" title="Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle">Redstone booster</a> on a 15-minute <a href="/wiki/Ballistics" title="Ballistics">ballistic</a> (suborbital) flight. <a href="/wiki/John_Glenn" title="John Glenn">John Glenn</a> became the first American to be launched into <a href="/wiki/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbit</a> by an <a href="/wiki/Atlas_LV-3B" title="Atlas LV-3B">Atlas launch vehicle</a> on February 20, 1962 aboard <a href="/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_6" title="Mercury-Atlas 6"><i>Friendship 7</i></a>.

<p>Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing <a href="/wiki/Space_rendezvous" title="Space rendezvous">space rendezvous</a> techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding <a href="/wiki/Extravehicular_activity" title="Extravehicular activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA) and <a href="/wiki/Space_rendezvous" title="Space rendezvous">rendezvous</a> and <a href="/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft" title="Docking and berthing of spacecraft">docking</a> to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, <a href="/wiki/Gemini_3" title="Gemini 3">Gemini 3</a>, was flown by <a href="/wiki/Gus_Grissom" title="Gus Grissom">Gus Grissom</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Young_(astronaut)" title="John Young (astronaut)">John Young</a> on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.</p>
<p>Under the direction of <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Premier of the Soviet Union">Soviet Premier</a> <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man <a href="/wiki/Voskhod_(spacecraft)" title="Voskhod (spacecraft)">Voskhod</a>. They succeeded in launching two manned flights before Gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first EVA in 1964.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Apollo_program" title="Apollo program">Apollo program</a></div>

<p>The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man in space) motivated President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the <a href="/wiki/Apollo_program" title="Apollo program">Apollo program</a>.</p>
<p>Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $206 billion in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Project" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a> cost roughly $26.3 billion, accounting for inflation.) It used the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saturn_rocket" title="Saturn rocket">Saturn rockets</a> as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.</p>
<p>The second manned mission, <a href="/wiki/Apollo_8" title="Apollo 8">Apollo 8</a>, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968. Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon. On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced and then finally the Moon landing was made on the <a href="/wiki/Apollo_11" title="Apollo 11">Apollo 11</a> mission in July 1969.</p>

<p>The first <a href="/wiki/List_of_Apollo_astronauts" title="List of Apollo astronauts">person to stand on the Moon</a> was <a href="/wiki/Neil_Armstrong" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a>, who was followed by <a href="/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin" title="Buzz Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)" title="Michael Collins (astronaut)">Michael Collins</a> orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842 lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included <a href="/wiki/Soil_mechanics" title="Soil mechanics">soil mechanics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meteoroid" title="Meteoroid">meteoroids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seismology" title="Seismology">seismology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heat_transfer" title="Heat transfer">heat flow</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_Experiment" title="Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment">lunar ranging</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic fields</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>. The Moon landing marked the end of the space race; and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.</p>
<p>Apollo set major <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_space_exploration_milestones,_1957-1969" title="List of space exploration milestones, 1957-1969">milestones</a> in human spaceflight.

Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974. It included a laboratory for studying the effects of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microgravity_environment" title="Microgravity environment">microgravity</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Apollo_Telescope_Mount" title="Apollo Telescope Mount">solar observatory</a>. NASA planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.</p>
<p>To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days.

<p>On May 24, 1972, US President <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Richard_M._Nixon" title="Richard M. Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> Premier <a href="/wiki/Alexei_Kosygin" title="Alexei Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a> signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other. This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus <a href="/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module" title="Apollo Command/Service Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)" title="Soyuz (spacecraft)">Soyuz</a> spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> in April 1981.</p>
<p>The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments, and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US–Russian space flights, such as the Shuttle–Mir Program and the International Space Station.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program" title="Space Shuttle program">Space Shuttle program</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia" title="Space Shuttle Columbia"><i>Columbia</i></a>, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.</p>
<p>Its major components were a <a href="/wiki/Spaceplane" title="Spaceplane">spaceplane</a> orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statute_mile" title="Statute mile">miles</a>) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.</p>
<p>On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried <a href="/wiki/Spacelab" title="Spacelab">Spacelab</a>, designed in cooperation with the <a href="/wiki/European_Space_Agency" title="European Space Agency">European Space Agency</a> (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an <a href="/wiki/Airlock" title="Airlock">airlock</a>. Another famous series of missions were the <a href="/wiki/STS-31" title="STS-31">launch</a> and later <a href="/wiki/STS-61" title="STS-61">successful repair</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 1990 and 1993, respectively.</p>
<p>In 1995, Russian-American interaction resumed with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shuttle-Mir_Program" title="Shuttle-Mir Program">Shuttle-Mir</a> missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the <a href="/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster" title="Space Shuttle Columbia disaster">Space Shuttle <i>Columbia</i> disaster</a>.</p>
<p>The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: <i><a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster" title="Space Shuttle Challenger disaster">Challenger</a></i> in 1986, and <i>Columbia</i> in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour" title="Space Shuttle Endeavour">Space Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i></a> from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the <a href="/wiki/STS-107" title="STS-107">second loss</a>. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle <i>Atlantis</i> at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.</p>

<p>Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as <a href="/wiki/List_of_International_Space_Station_expeditions" title="List of International Space Station expeditions">ISS Expeditions</a>. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS. The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members. Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past <span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7008505654968000000♠</span>16 years and 8 days, having exceeded the previous record held by <a href="/wiki/Mir" title="Mir">Mir</a>; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from <a href="/wiki/List_of_International_Space_Station_visitors" title="List of International Space Station visitors">15 different nations</a>.</p>
<p>The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2016, is the largest artificial satellite in <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The <a href="/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)" title="Soyuz (spacecraft)">Soyuz</a> spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services" title="Commercial Resupply Services">Commercial Resupply Services</a></div>

<p>The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS. The development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program, meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful completed the milestone. Private companies were also required to have some "skin in the game" which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal.</p>
<p>On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts to <a href="/wiki/SpaceX" title="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> and <a href="/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_Corporation" title="Orbital Sciences Corporation">Orbital Sciences Corporation</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development" title="Commercial Crew Development">Commercial Crew Development</a> (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth. It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by <a href="/wiki/Bigelow_Aerospace" title="Bigelow Aerospace">Bigelow Aerospace</a>. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.</p>
<p>In 2010, NASA announced the winners of the first phase of the program, a total of $50 million was divided among five American companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector. In 2011, the winners of the second phase of the program were announced, $270 million was divided among four companies. In 2012, the winners of the third phase of the program were announced, NASA provided $1.1 billion divided among three companies to further develop their crew transportation systems.

<p>For missions beyond <a href="/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit" title="Low Earth orbit">low Earth orbit</a> (BLEO), NASA has been directed to develop the <a href="/wiki/Space_Launch_System" title="Space Launch System">Space Launch System</a> (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orion_spacecraft" title="Orion spacecraft">Orion</a>. In February 2010, President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s administration proposed eliminating public funds for the <a href="/wiki/Constellation_program" title="Constellation program">Constellation program</a> and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned <a href="/wiki/Ares_V" title="Ares V">Ares V</a>. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The <a href="/wiki/NASA_Authorization_Act_of_2010" title="NASA Authorization Act of 2010">NASA Authorization Act of 2010</a> was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.</p>

<p>The Authorization Act required a newly designed HLV be chosen within 90 days of its passing; the launch vehicle was given the name "Space Launch System". The new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orion_spacecraft" title="Orion spacecraft">Orion spacecraft</a>, which was being developed as part of the Constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role. The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit. The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift 70 mt into <a href="/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit" title="Low Earth orbit">LEO</a>. It is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Exploration_Flight_Test_1" title="Exploration Flight Test 1">Exploration Flight Test 1</a> (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of Orion's crew module, was launched on December 5, 2014, atop a <a href="/wiki/Delta_IV_Heavy" title="Delta IV Heavy">Delta IV Heavy</a> rocket. <a href="/wiki/Exploration_Mission_1" title="Exploration Mission 1">Exploration Mission-1</a> (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS that would also send Orion on a <a href="/wiki/Circumlunar_trajectory" title="Circumlunar trajectory">circumlunar trajectory</a>, which is planned for 2017.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Unmanned_NASA_missions" title="Unmanned NASA missions">Unmanned NASA missions</a></div>
<p>More than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the solar system. Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA. The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.</p>
<p>The first US unmanned satellite was <a href="/wiki/Explorer_1" title="Explorer 1">Explorer 1</a>, which started as an ABMA/JPL project during the early part of the <a href="/wiki/Space_Race" title="Space Race">Space Race</a>. It was launched in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA the Explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring magnetic fields and the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>, among other aspects. A more recent Earth mission, not related to the Explorer program, was the <a href="/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inner_Solar_System" title="Inner Solar System">inner Solar System</a> has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs. The first was <a href="/wiki/Mariner_program" title="Mariner program">Mariner</a> in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple visits to <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> and one to <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (<a href="/wiki/Mariner_2" title="Mariner 2">Mariner 2</a>), to take the first pictures from another planet (<a href="/wiki/Mariner_4" title="Mariner 4">Mariner 4</a>), the first planetary orbiter (<a href="/wiki/Mariner_9" title="Mariner 9">Mariner 9</a>), and the first to make a <a href="/wiki/Gravity_assist" title="Gravity assist">gravity assist</a> maneuver (<a href="/wiki/Mariner_10" title="Mariner 10">Mariner 10</a>). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.</p>
<p>The first successful landing on Mars was made by <a href="/wiki/Viking_1" title="Viking 1">Viking 1</a> in 1976. Twenty years later a rover was landed on Mars by <a href="/wiki/Mars_Pathfinder" title="Mars Pathfinder">Mars Pathfinder</a>.</p>
<p>Outside Mars, Jupiter was first visited by <a href="/wiki/Pioneer_10" title="Pioneer 10">Pioneer 10</a> in 1973. More than 20 years later <i><a href="/wiki/Galileo_(spacecraft)" title="Galileo (spacecraft)">Galileo</a></i> sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet. <a href="/wiki/Pioneer_11" title="Pioneer 11">Pioneer 11</a> became the first spacecraft to visit <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a> in 1979, with <a href="/wiki/Voyager_2" title="Voyager 2">Voyager 2</a> making the first (and so far only) visits to <a href="/wiki/Uranus" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a> in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both <a href="/wiki/Voyager_1" title="Voyager 1">Voyager 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/Voyager_2" title="Voyager 2">Voyager 2</a>.</p>
<p>Pioneers 10 and 11 and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, it took about 3 hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2011, NASA's <a href="/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory" title="Mars Science Laboratory">Mars Science Laboratory</a> mission was successfully launched for Mars. <i><a href="/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)" title="Curiosity (rover)">Curiosity</a></i> successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/NASA_facilities" title="NASA facilities">NASA facilities</a></div>
<p>NASA's facilities are research, construction and communication centers to help its missions. Some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line <a href="/wiki/NASA_Railroad" title="NASA Railroad">railroad at the Kennedy Space Center</a> and own special aircraft, for instance two <a href="/wiki/Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft" title="Shuttle Carrier Aircraft">Boeing 747 that transport Space Shuttle orbiter</a>.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is one of the best-known NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Budget">Budget</span></h2>


<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Budget_of_NASA" title="Budget of NASA">Budget of NASA</a></div>
<p>NASA's budget has generally been approximately 1% of the federal budget from the early 1970s on, after briefly peaking at approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the Apollo program. Public perception of NASA's budget has differed significantly from reality; a 1997 poll indicated that most Americans responded that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.</p>
<p>The percentage of federal budget that NASA has been allocated has been steadily dropping since the Apollo program and in 2012 it was estimated at 0.48% of the federal budget. In a March 2012 meeting of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science_and_Transportation" title="United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation">United States Senate Science Committee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson" title="Neil deGrasse Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> testified that "Right now, NASA’s annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow."</p>
<p>For Fiscal Year 2015, NASA received an appropriation of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$18.01 billion</span> from Congress—$549 million more than requested and approximately $350 million more than the 2014 NASA budget passed by Congress.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impact">Environmental impact</span></h2>
<p>The exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems, both in Earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely effect the Earth's environment. Some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hypergolic" title="Hypergolic">hypergolic</a> rocket propellants, such as <a href="/wiki/Hydrazine" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a>, are highly toxic prior to <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a>, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a>, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust. However, carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed 802,620,000 US gallons (3.0382<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 L) gallons of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single <a href="/wiki/Falcon_9" title="Falcon 9">Falcon 9</a> rocket first stage burns around 25,000 US gallons (95,000 L) of <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a> fuel per launch. Even if a Falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LOx" title="LOx">LOx</a>- and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LH2" title="LH2">LH2</a>- fueled engines, like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SSME" title="SSME">SSME</a>, is almost entirely water vapor. NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled <a href="/wiki/Constellation_program" title="Constellation program">Constellation program</a> in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2011. In contrast, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ion_engines" title="Ion engines">ion engines</a> use harmless noble gases like <a href="/wiki/Xenon" title="Xenon">xenon</a> for propulsion.</p>
<p>On May 8, 2003, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a> to produce energy at one of its facilities—the <a href="/wiki/Goddard_Space_Flight_Center" title="Goddard Space Flight Center">Goddard Space Flight Center</a>, Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
<p>An example of NASA's environmental efforts is the <a href="/wiki/NASA_Sustainability_Base" title="NASA Sustainability Base">NASA Sustainability Base</a>. Additionally, the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Exploration_Sciences_Building&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Exploration Sciences Building (page does not exist)">Exploration Sciences Building</a> was awarded the LEED Gold rating in 2010.</p>
