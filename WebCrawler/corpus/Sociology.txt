<p><b>Sociology</b> is the study of <a href="/wiki/Social_behavior" title="Social behavior">social behaviour</a> or <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a>. It is a <a href="/wiki/Social_science" title="Social science">social science</a> that uses various methods of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empirical_method" title="Empirical method">empirical investigation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Critical_analysis" title="Critical analysis">critical analysis</a> to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to <a href="/wiki/Social_policy" title="Social policy">social policy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Welfare" title="Welfare">welfare</a>, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Micro-sociology" title="Micro-sociology">micro-sociology</a> level of individual <a href="/wiki/Agency_(sociology)" title="Agency (sociology)">agency</a> and interaction to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macro-sociology" title="Macro-sociology">macro</a> level of systems and the <a href="/wiki/Social_structure" title="Social structure">social structure</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional focuses of sociology include <a href="/wiki/Social_stratification" title="Social stratification">social stratification</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">social class</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_mobility" title="Social mobility">social mobility</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_religion" title="Sociology of religion">religion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Secularization" title="Secularization">secularization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_law" title="Sociology of law">law</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sexuality" title="Sexuality">sexuality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)" title="Deviance (sociology)">deviance</a>. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between <a href="/wiki/Structure_and_agency" title="Structure and agency">social structure and individual agency</a>, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sociology_of_health" title="Sociology of health">health</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medical_sociology" title="Medical sociology">medical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Military_sociology" title="Military sociology">military</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_punishment" title="Sociology of punishment">penal</a> <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_the_Internet" title="Sociology of the Internet">the Internet</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sociology_of_Education" title="Sociology of Education">education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a> and the role of social activity in the development of <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge" title="Sociology of scientific knowledge">scientific knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>The range of social scientific methods has also expanded. <a href="/wiki/Social_research" title="Social research">Social researchers</a> draw upon a variety of <a href="/wiki/Qualitative_research" title="Qualitative research">qualitative</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_research" title="Quantitative research">quantitative</a> techniques. The <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_turn" title="Linguistic turn">linguistic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cultural_turn" title="Cultural turn">cultural turns</a> of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly <a href="/wiki/Verstehen" title="Verstehen">interpretative</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hermeneutic" title="Hermeneutic">hermeneutic</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosophic" title="Philosophic">philosophic</a> approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new <a href="/wiki/Analytical_sociology" title="Analytical sociology">analytically</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_sociology" title="Mathematical sociology">mathematically</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computational_sociology" title="Computational sociology">computationally</a> rigorous techniques, such as <a href="/wiki/Agent-based_model" title="Agent-based model">agent-based modelling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">social network analysis</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h3>

<p>Sociological reasoning pre-dates the foundation of the discipline. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_analysis" title="Social analysis">Social analysis</a> has origins in the common stock of <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western knowledge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and has been carried out from as far back as the time of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy" title="Ancient Greek philosophy">ancient Greek philosopher</a> <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>, if not before. The origin of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statistical_survey" title="Statistical survey">survey</a>, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the <a href="/wiki/Domesday_Book" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Some consider <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun" title="Ibn Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a>, a 14th-century <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Islamic" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see <a href="/wiki/Early_Islamic_philosophy#Branches" title="Early Islamic philosophy">Branches of the early Islamic philosophy</a>); his <i><a href="/wiki/Muqaddimah" title="Muqaddimah">Muqaddimah</a></i> was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_cohesion" title="Social cohesion">social cohesion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_conflict" title="Social conflict">social conflict</a>.</p>
<p>The word <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sociology" title="wiktionary:sociology">sociology</a></i> (or <i>"sociologie"</i>) is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word: <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/socius" title="wiktionary:socius">socius</a></i>, "companion"; the suffix <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-logy" title="wiktionary:-logy">-logy</a></i>, "the study of" from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1" title="wiktionary:-λογία">-λογία</a> from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82" title="wiktionary:λόγος">λόγος</a>, <i>lógos</i>, "word", "knowledge". It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emmanuel-Joseph_Siey%C3%A8s" title="Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès">Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès</a> (1748–1836) in an unpublished <a href="/wiki/Manuscript" title="Manuscript">manuscript</a>. Sociology was later defined independently by the French <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosopher_of_science" title="Philosopher of science">philosopher of science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Auguste_Comte" title="Auguste Comte">Auguste Comte</a> (1798–1857), in 1838. Comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society. Comte had earlier used the term "social physics", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician <a href="/wiki/Adolphe_Quetelet" title="Adolphe Quetelet">Adolphe Quetelet</a>. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological <a href="/wiki/Positivism" title="Positivism">positivism</a>, an epistemological approach outlined in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Course_in_Positive_Philosophy" title="The Course in Positive Philosophy">The Course in Positive Philosophy</a></i> (1830–1842) and <i><a href="/wiki/A_General_View_of_Positivism" title="A General View of Positivism">A General View of Positivism</a></i> (1848). Comte believed a <a href="/wiki/Law_of_three_stages" title="Law of three stages">positivist stage</a> would mark the final era, after conjectural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theological" title="Theological">theological</a> and <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> phases, in the progression of human understanding. In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosopher_of_science" title="Philosopher of science">philosopher of science</a> in the modern sense of the term.</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Comte gave a powerful impetus to the development of sociology, an impetus which bore fruit in the later decades of the nineteenth century. To say this is certainly not to claim that French sociologists such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durkheim" title="Durkheim">Durkheim</a> were devoted disciples of the high priest of positivism. But by insisting on the irreducibility of each of his basic sciences to the particular science of sciences which it presupposed in the hierarchy and by emphasizing the nature of sociology as the scientific study of social phenomena Comte put sociology on the map. To be sure, [its] beginnings can be traced back well beyond <a href="/wiki/Montesquieu" title="Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a>, for example, and to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Condorcet" title="Condorcet">Condorcet</a>, not to speak of <a href="/wiki/Claude_Henri_de_Rouvroy,_comte_de_Saint-Simon" title="Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon">Saint-Simon</a>, Comte's immediate predecessor. But Comte's clear recognition of sociology as a particular science, with a character of its own, justified Durkheim in regarding him as the father or founder of this science, in spite of the fact that Durkheim did not accept the idea of the three states and criticized Comte's approach to sociology.</p>

<p>Both <a href="/wiki/Auguste_Comte" title="Auguste Comte">Auguste Comte</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> (1818–1883) set out to develop scientifically justified systems in the wake of European <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Secularization" title="Secularization">secularization</a>, informed by various key movements in the <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_history" title="Philosophy of history">philosophies of history</a> <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_science" title="Philosophy of science">and science</a>. Marx rejected Comtean positivism but in attempting to develop a <i>science of society</i> nevertheless came to be recognized as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning. For <a href="/wiki/Isaiah_Berlin" title="Isaiah Berlin">Isaiah Berlin</a>, Marx may be regarded as the "true father" of modern sociology, "in so far as anyone can claim the title."</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>To have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principle achievement of Marx's theory. The sociological treatment of historical and moral problems, which Comte and after him, <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Spencer" title="Herbert Spencer">Spencer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hippolyte_Taine" title="Hippolyte Taine">Taine</a>, had discussed and mapped, became a precise and concrete study only when the attack of militant Marxism made its conclusions a burning issue, and so made the search for evidence more zealous and the attention to method more intense.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Herbert_Spencer" title="Herbert Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a> (27 April 1820 – 8 December 1903) was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including <a href="/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a>, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Division_of_Labour_in_Society" title="Division of Labour in Society">Division of Labour in Society</a></i> is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable <a href="/wiki/Biologist" title="Biologist">biologist</a>, Spencer coined the term "<a href="/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest" title="Survival of the fittest">survival of the fittest</a>". While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a <a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> style of government.

<p>The first formal Department of Sociology in the world was established by <a href="/wiki/Albion_Woodbury_Small" title="Albion Woodbury Small">Albion Small</a> - at the invitation of <a href="/wiki/William_Rainey_Harper" title="William Rainey Harper">William Rainey Harper</a> - at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in 1892, and the <a href="/wiki/American_Journal_of_Sociology" title="American Journal of Sociology">American Journal of Sociology</a> was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by Small as well. However, the institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical <a href="/wiki/Social_research" title="Social research">social research</a>. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bordeaux" title="University of Bordeaux">University of Bordeaux</a> in 1895, publishing his <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rules_of_the_Sociological_Method" title="Rules of the Sociological Method">Rules of the Sociological Method</a></i> (1895). For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the "science of <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a>, their genesis and their functioning".</p>
<p>Durkheim's monograph, <i><a href="/wiki/Suicide_(book)" title="Suicide (book)">Suicide</a></i> (1897) is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists. <i>Suicide</i> is a case study of variations in suicide rates among <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of <a href="/wiki/Structural_functionalism" title="Structural functionalism">structural functionalism</a>. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Psychological" title="Psychological">psychological</a>) causes. He developed the notion of objective <i><a href="/wiki/Sui_generis" title="Sui generis">sui generis</a></i> "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study. Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social <a href="/wiki/Anomie" title="Anomie">anomie</a>".</p>
<p>Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modernity</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urbanization" title="Urbanization">urbanization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Secularization" title="Secularization">secularization</a>, and the process of "<a href="/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)" title="Rationalization (sociology)">rationalization</a>". The field predominated in <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a>, with British <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a> generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_world" title="Anglo-Saxon world">Anglo-Saxon world</a>.

<p>Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> (1864–1920) are typically cited as the three principal architects of sociology. <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Spencer" title="Herbert Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Graham_Sumner" title="William Graham Sumner">William Graham Sumner</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lester_F._Ward" title="Lester F.

<p>Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with industrialization and the new social division of labor which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation'). Together the works of these great classical sociologists suggest what Giddens has recently described as 'a multidimensional view of institutions of modernity' and which emphasises not only capitalism and industrialism as key institutions of modernity, but also 'surveillance' (meaning 'control of information and social supervision') and 'military power' (control of the means of violence in the context of the industrialisation of war).</p>

<p>The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning; there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism. Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a>. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lo%C3%AFc_Wacquant" title="Loïc Wacquant">Loïc Wacquant</a> distinguishes three major strains of positivism: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durkheimian" title="Durkheimian">Durkheimian</a>, Logical, and Instrumental. None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid (and perhaps optimistic) version. While Émile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. He developed the notion of objective <i>sui generis</i> "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.</p>
<p>The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed <i>instrumental positivism</i>. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Replicability" title="Replicability">replicability</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reliabilism" title="Reliabilism">reliability</a> and <a href="/wiki/Validity" title="Validity">validity</a>. This positivism is more or less synonymous with <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_research" title="Quantitative research">quantitative research</a>, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to <a href="/wiki/Paul_Lazarsfeld" title="Paul Lazarsfeld">Paul Lazarsfeld</a>, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them.

<p>At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-positivism" title="Anti-positivism">anti-positivism</a>, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">norms</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)" title="Value (personal and cultural)">values</a>, <a href="/wiki/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbols</a>, and social processes viewed from a resolutely <a href="/wiki/Subject_(philosophy)" title="Subject (philosophy)">subjective</a> perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify <a href="/wiki/Causality" title="Causality">causal relationships</a> of human "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_action" title="Social action">social action</a>"—especially among "<a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" title="Ideal type">ideal types</a>", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as "historical, invariant, or generalisable" as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_T%C3%B6nnies" title="Ferdinand Tönnies">Ferdinand Tönnies</a>, theorized on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on "<a href="/wiki/Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft" title="Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft">Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft</a>" (lit. <i>community</i> and <i>society</i>). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ("pure sociology"), whereas the second empirically and inductively ("applied sociology").</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>[Sociology is] ... the science whose object is to interpret <i>the meaning of social action</i> and thereby give a <i>causal explanation</i> of the way in which the <i>action proceeds</i> and the <i>effects which it produces</i>. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as <i>subjectively meaningful</i> ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' to be thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of <i>prior</i> discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.</p>

<p>Both Weber and <a href="/wiki/Georg_Simmel" title="Georg Simmel">Georg Simmel</a> pioneered the "<i><a href="/wiki/Verstehen" title="Verstehen">Verstehen</a></i>" (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the <a href="/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)" title="Phenomenology (philosophy)">phenomenological</a> and <a href="/wiki/Existentialism" title="Existentialism">existential</a> writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality. His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The deepest problems of modern life flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. The antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labor) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietssche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition – but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being leveled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Classical_theory">Classical theory</span></h3>
<p>The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic as a result of the contentions of classical social theory. In <a href="/wiki/Randall_Collins" title="Randall Collins">Randall Collins</a>' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (<a href="/wiki/Georg_Simmel" title="Georg Simmel">Simmel</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Pragmatism" title="Pragmatism">pragmatist</a> (<a href="/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead" title="George Herbert Mead">Mead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Cooley" title="Charles Cooley">Cooley</a>) theories of social interaction. <a href="/wiki/Utilitarianism" title="Utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by <a href="/wiki/Raewyn_Connell" title="Raewyn Connell">Raewyn Connell</a>, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of <a href="/wiki/Social_Darwinism" title="Social Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a>, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Spencer" title="Herbert Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lester_F._Ward" title="Lester F. Ward">Lester F. Ward</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Graham_Sumner" title="William Graham Sumner">William Graham Sumner</a>. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Functionalism">Functionalism</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Structural_functionalism" title="Structural functionalism">Structural functionalism</a></div>
<p>A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, functionalism addresses the <a href="/wiki/Social_structure" title="Social structure">social structure</a>, referred to as <a href="/wiki/Social_organization" title="Social organization">social organization</a> in among the classical theorists, as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Spencer" title="Herbert Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>) is to regard <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">norms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a> as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Mauss" title="Marcel Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bronis%C5%82aw_Malinowski" title="Bronisław Malinowski">Bronisław Malinowski</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radcliffe-Brown" title="Radcliffe-Brown">Radcliffe-Brown</a>. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_evolutionism" title="Social evolutionism">social evolutionism</a>, in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Giddens" title="Anthony Giddens">Giddens</a> states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conflict_theory" title="Conflict theory">Conflict theory</a></div>
<p>Functionalist theories emphasize "cohesive systems" and are often contrasted with "conflict theories", which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality between particular groups. The following quotes from Durkheim and Marx epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">

This tradition emerged in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicago_School_(sociology)" title="Chicago School (sociology)"><i>Chicago School</i></a> of the 1920s and 1930s, which prior to World War II "had been <i>the</i> center of sociological research and graduate study". The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings. Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation. Some important sociologists associated with this approach include <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead" title="George Herbert Mead">George Herbert Mead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Erving_Goffman" title="Erving Goffman">Erving Goffman</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/George_Homans" title="George Homans">George Homans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Blau" title="Peter Blau">Peter Blau</a>. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of <a href="/wiki/Ethnomethodology" title="Ethnomethodology">Ethnomethodology</a> emerges from the work of <a href="/wiki/Harold_Garfinkel" title="Harold Garfinkel">Harold Garfinkel</a>.</p>

<p>Utilitarianism is often referred to as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exchange_theory" title="Exchange theory">exchange theory</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rational_choice_theory" title="Rational choice theory">rational choice theory</a> in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by <a href="/wiki/Josh_Whitford" title="Josh Whitford">Josh Whitford</a>, rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has (1) "a knowledge of alternatives," (2) "a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives," (3) "an ordering of preferences over outcomes," (4) "A decision rule, to select among the possible alternatives" Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of <a href="/wiki/George_C._Homans" title="George C.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th-century_social_theory">20th-century social theory</span></h3>
<p>Following the decline of theories of sociocultural evolution, in the United States, the interactionism of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_school_(sociology)" title="Chicago school (sociology)">Chicago School</a> dominated American sociology. As <a href="/wiki/Anselm_Strauss" title="Anselm Strauss">Anselm Strauss</a> describes, "We didn't think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology; we thought it was sociology." After World War II, mainstream sociology shifted to the survey-research of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Lazarsfeld" title="Paul Lazarsfeld">Paul Lazarsfeld</a> at <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> and the general theorizing of <a href="/wiki/Pitirim_Sorokin" title="Pitirim Sorokin">Pitirim Sorokin</a>, followed by <a href="/wiki/Talcott_Parsons" title="Talcott Parsons">Talcott Parsons</a> at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>. Ultimately, "the failure of the Chicago, Columbia, and Wisconsin [sociology] departments to produce a significant number of graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 1936–45 was to the advantage of the Harvard department." As Parsons began to dominate general theory, his work predominately referenced European sociology—almost entirely omitting citations of both the American tradition of sociocultural-evolution as well as pragmatism. In addition to Parsons' revision of the sociological canon (which included Marshall, Pareto, Weber and Durkheim), the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the Parsonian structural-functionalist movement, which reached its crescendo in the 1950s, but by the 1960s was in rapid decline.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, most functionalisms in Europe had broadly been replaced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conflict_theory" title="Conflict theory">conflict</a>-oriented approaches and to many in the discipline, functionalism was considered "as dead as a dodo." "According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy."</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pax_Wisconsana">Pax Wisconsana</span></h4>
<p>While some conflict approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically oriented <a href="/wiki/Middle_range_theory_(sociology)" title="Middle range theory (sociology)">middle-range theories</a> with no single overarching, or "grand", theoretical orientation. <a href="/wiki/John_Levi_Martin" title="John Levi Martin">John Levi Martin</a> refers to this "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" as the <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Pax_Wisconsana&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Pax Wisconsana (page does not exist)">Pax Wisconsana</a></i>, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison" title="University of Wisconsin–Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. <a href="/wiki/Omar_Lizardo" title="Omar Lizardo">Omar Lizardo</a> describes the <i>Pax Wisconsana</i> as: "a Midwestern flavored, <a href="/wiki/Robert_K._Merton" title="Robert K. Merton">Mertonian</a> resolution of the theory/method wars in which [sociologists] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) <a href="/wiki/Grand_theory" title="Grand theory">grand theory</a>' is a waste of time; (2) [and] good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin." Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Structuralism">Structuralism</span></h4>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Structural_linguistics" title="Structural linguistics">structuralist</a> movement originated primarily from the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Giddens" title="Anthony Giddens">Anthony Giddens</a>' theory of structuration draws on the <a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistic</a> theory of <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure" title="Ferdinand de Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a> and the French anthropologist <a href="/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss" title="Claude Lévi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a>. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semiotic" title="Semiotic">semiotic</a> understanding of human culture as a <a href="/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)" title="Sign (semiotics)">system of signs</a>. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.</p>
<p>The second tradition of structuralist thought, contemporaneous with Giddens, emerges from the American school of social network analysis, spearheaded by the <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Department_of_Social_Relations" title="Harvard Department of Social Relations">Harvard Department of Social Relations</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Harrison_White" title="Harrison White">Harrison White</a> and his students in the 1970s and 1980s. This tradition of structuralist thought argues that, rather than semiotics, social structure is networks of patterned social relations. And, rather than Levi-Strauss, this school of thought draws on the notions of structure as theorized by Levi-Strauss' contemporary anthropologist, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radcliffe-Brown" title="Radcliffe-Brown">Radcliffe-Brown</a>. Some refer to this as "network structuralism," and equate it to "British structuralism" as opposed to the "French structuralism" of Levi-Strauss.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-structuralism">Post-structuralism</span></h4>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post-structuralist" title="Post-structuralist">Post-structuralist</a> thought has tended to <a href="/wiki/Antihumanism" title="Antihumanism">reject 'humanist' assumptions</a> in the conduct of social <a href="/wiki/Theory" title="Theory">theory</a>. <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> provides a potent critique in his <i><a href="/wiki/The_Order_of_Things" title="The Order of Things">Archaeology of the Human Sciences</a></i>, though Habermas and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Rorty" title="Richard Rorty">Rorty</a> have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another. The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-humanist" title="Anti-humanist">anti-humanist</a> position has been associated with "<a href="/wiki/Postmodernism" title="Postmodernism">postmodernism</a>", a term used in specific contexts to describe an <i>era</i> or <i>phenomena</i>, but occasionally construed as a <i>method</i>.</p>

<p>Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central problems of sociological theory, which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. This consensus is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity" title="Subjectivity and objectivity">subjectivity and objectivity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Structure_and_agency" title="Structure and agency">structure and agency</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Synchrony_and_diachrony" title="Synchrony and diachrony">synchrony and diachrony</a>. The first deals with <i>knowledge</i>, the second with <i>action</i>, and the last with <i>time</i>. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subjectivity_and_objectivity">Subjectivity and objectivity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Objectivity_(science)" title="Objectivity (science)">Objectivity (science)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">Objectivity (philosophy)</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Subjectivity" title="Subjectivity">Subjectivity</a></div>
<p>The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists, is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is <i><a href="/wiki/Intersubjectivity" title="Intersubjectivity">intersubjectivity</a></i> achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description <a href="/wiki/In_situ" title="In situ">in situ</a>.</p>
<p>The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialised and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalised? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure_and_agency">Structure and agency</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Structure_and_agency" title="Structure and agency">Structure and agency</a></div>
<p>Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '<a href="/wiki/Agency_(sociology)" title="Agency (sociology)">agency</a>' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '<a href="/wiki/Social_structure" title="Social structure">structure</a>' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological <a href="/wiki/Epistemology" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a> ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?"). A perennial question within this debate is that of "<a href="/wiki/Social_reproduction" title="Social reproduction">social reproduction</a>": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Synchrony_and_diachrony">Synchrony and diachrony</span></h3>
<p>Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Levi-Strauss" title="Levi-Strauss">Levi-Strauss</a> who inherited it from the linguistics of <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure" title="Ferdinand de Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a>. The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a <i>language</i>, while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual <i>speech</i>. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to <i>Central Problems in Social Theory</i>, he states that, "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of <a href="/wiki/Social_reproduction" title="Social reproduction">social reproduction</a>. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim. Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Research_methodology">Research methodology</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Social_research" title="Social research">Social research</a></div>
<p>Many people divide sociological research methods into two broad categories, although many others see research methods as a continuum:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quantitative_method" title="Quantitative method">Quantitative designs</a> approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Qualitative_research" title="Qualitative research">Qualitative designs</a> emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality</li>
</ul>
<p>Many sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between <a href="/wiki/Social_theory" title="Social theory">theory</a> and data. Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States. In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two. (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are <a href="/wiki/Qualitative_research" title="Qualitative research">qualitative</a>.) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective, and the very term "methodology" is often used synonymously with "<a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a>." Practically all sociology PhD programmes in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the greater public, though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists.</p>
<p>The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Survey_research" title="Survey research">survey questionnaire</a> to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's <a href="/wiki/Social_actions" title="Social actions">social actions</a> may choose ethnographic <a href="/wiki/Participant_observation" title="Participant observation">participant observation</a> or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or <a href="/wiki/Triangulation_(social_science)" title="Triangulation (social science)">'triangulate'</a>, quantitative <i>and</i> qualitative methods as part of a 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of <a href="/wiki/Agency_(sociology)" title="Agency (sociology)">agency</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sampling">Sampling</span></h3>

<p>Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete <a href="/wiki/Enumeration" title="Enumeration">enumeration</a> of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable <a href="/wiki/Subset" title="Subset">subset</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Statistical_population" title="Statistical population">population</a>. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw <a href="/wiki/Inference" title="Inference">inferences</a> from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)" title="Sampling (statistics)">'sampling'</a>. While it is usually best to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Random_sampling" title="Random sampling">sample randomly</a>, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for <a href="/wiki/Stratified_sampling" title="Stratified sampling">stratified sampling</a>. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates <a href="/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling" title="Nonprobability sampling">nonprobability sampling</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Convenience_sampling" title="Convenience sampling">convenience sampling</a> or <a href="/wiki/Snowball_sampling" title="Snowball sampling">snowball sampling</a>.</p>

<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Experimental_research" title="Experimental research">Experimental research</a>: The researcher isolates a single social process and reproduces it in a laboratory (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking to determine whether or not certain social <a href="/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables" title="Dependent and independent variables">variables</a> can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender <a href="/wiki/Stereotype" title="Stereotype">stereotypes</a>). Participants are <a href="/wiki/Random_assignment" title="Random assignment">randomly assigned</a> to different groups that either serve as <a href="/wiki/Scientific_control" title="Scientific control">controls</a>—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments.

<li><a href="/wiki/Observation" title="Observation">Observation</a>: Using data from the senses, the researcher records information about social phenomenon or behaviour.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Computational_sociology">Computational sociology</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Computational_sociology" title="Computational sociology">Computational sociology</a></div>
<p>Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena. Using <a href="/wiki/Computer_simulation" title="Computer simulation">computer simulations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Text_mining" title="Text mining">text mining</a>, complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like <a href="/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">social network</a> analysis and <a href="/wiki/Social_sequence_analysis" title="Social sequence analysis">social sequence analysis</a>, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modelling of social interactions.</p>
<p>Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> and artificial intelligence. By the same token, some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of <a href="/wiki/Centrality" title="Centrality">network centrality</a> from the fields of social network analysis and <a href="/wiki/Network_science" title="Network science">network science</a>. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of <a href="/wiki/Social_complexity" title="Social complexity">social complexity</a>. Social complexity concepts such as <a href="/wiki/Complex_systems" title="Complex systems">complex systems</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-linear" title="Non-linear">non-linear</a> interconnection among macro and micro process, and <a href="/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a>, have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_culture" title="Sociology of culture">Sociology of culture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cultural_studies" title="Cultural studies">Cultural studies</a></div>
<p>Sociologists' approach to culture can be divided into a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not entirely interchangeable. The sociology of culture is an older term, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. Conversely, cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural. Sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena.</p>
<p>For <a href="/wiki/Georg_Simmel" title="Georg Simmel">Simmel</a>, culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". While early theorists such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durkheim" title="Durkheim">Durkheim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Mauss" title="Marcel Mauss">Mauss</a> were influential in <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropology</a>, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modern</a> (rather than <a href="/wiki/Primitive_culture" title="Primitive culture">primitive</a> or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hermeneutic" title="Hermeneutic">hermeneutic</a> analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with <a href="/wiki/Critical_theory" title="Critical theory">critical theory</a> in the vein of <a href="/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno" title="Theodor W. Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walter_Benjamin" title="Walter Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</a>, and other members of the <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt_School" title="Frankfurt School">Frankfurt School</a>. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_studies" title="Cultural studies">cultural studies</a>. <a href="/wiki/Centre_for_Contemporary_Cultural_Studies" title="Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies">Birmingham School</a> theorists such as <a href="/wiki/Richard_Hoggart" title="Richard Hoggart">Richard Hoggart</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Hall_(cultural_theorist)" title="Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)">Stuart Hall</a> questioned the division between "producers" and "consumers" evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a <a href="/wiki/Subculture" title="Subculture">subculture</a> (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The "<a href="/wiki/Cultural_turn" title="Cultural turn">cultural turn</a>" of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Art.2C_music_and_literature">Art, music and literature</span></h4>

<p>Sociology of literature, film, and art is a subset of the sociology of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 <i>Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire</i>, translated by Susan Emanuel as <i>Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field</i> (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.</p>

The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">norms</a>, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced. The concept of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_disorganization" title="Social disorganization">social disorganization</a> is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Robert_K._Merton" title="Robert K. Merton">Robert K. Merton</a> produced a <a href="/wiki/Robert_K._Merton#Merton.27s_theory_of_deviance" title="Robert K.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sociology_of_law">Sociology of law</span></h4>
<p>The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the "visible symbol" of social solidarity. The sociology of law refers to both a sub-discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a> and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime; and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial <a href="/wiki/Social_stratification" title="Social stratification">stratification</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Economic_sociology" title="Economic sociology">Economic sociology</a></div>
<p>The term "economic sociology" was first used by <a href="/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons" title="William Stanley Jevons">William Stanley Jevons</a> in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modernity</a> as a philosophical concept. The relationship between <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modernity</a> is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's <i><a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></i> (1905) and Simmel's <i><a href="/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Money" title="The Philosophy of Money">The Philosophy of Money</a></i> (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as <i>new economic sociology</i>, was consolidated by the 1985 work of <a href="/wiki/Mark_Granovetter" title="Mark Granovetter">Mark Granovetter</a> titled "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness".

A classic 1966 study in this field by <a href="/wiki/James_Samuel_Coleman" title="James Samuel Coleman">James Coleman</a>, known as the "Coleman Report", analysed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (<i>i.e.</i> per pupil spending). The controversy over "school effects" ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for <a href="/wiki/Desegregation_busing" title="Desegregation busing">desegregation busing</a> in American public schools.</p>

<p>Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become <i>defined</i> and <i>known</i> to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist <a href="/wiki/John_Bellamy_Foster" title="John Bellamy Foster">John Bellamy Foster</a>, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_rift" title="Metabolic rift">metabolic rift</a>, which influenced contemporary thought on <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a>.

<p>Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institution</a> and unit of <a href="/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">socialization</a>, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_family" title="Nuclear family">nuclear family</a> and its distinct <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gender_roles" title="Gender roles">gender roles</a>. The notion of "<a href="/wiki/Childhood" title="Childhood">childhood</a>" is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. <a href="/wiki/Feminist_sociology" title="Feminist sociology">Feminist sociology</a>, on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of <a href="/wiki/Feminist_theory" title="Feminist theory">feminist theory</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Patriarchy" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a> and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. <a href="/wiki/Feminist_sociology" title="Feminist sociology">Feminist sociology</a> also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" is also a concern. <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">Social psychology</a> of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification.

<p>The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably <a href="/wiki/Max_Scheler" title="Max Scheler">Max Scheler</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mannheim" title="Karl Mannheim">Karl Mannheim</a>, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of <a href="/wiki/Structural_functionalism" title="Structural functionalism">functionalism</a> through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by <a href="/wiki/Peter_L._Berger" title="Peter L. Berger">Peter L. Berger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Luckmann" title="Thomas Luckmann">Thomas Luckmann</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality" title="The Social Construction of Reality">The Social Construction of Reality</a></i> (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socially_constructed_reality" title="Socially constructed reality">socially constructed reality</a></i>). The "archaeological" and "genealogical" studies of <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> are of considerable contemporary influence.</p>
<p>The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing "with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity." Important theorists in the sociology of science include <a href="/wiki/Robert_K._Merton" title="Robert K. Merton">Robert K.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Political_sociology" title="Political sociology">Political sociology</a></div>

<p>Historically political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society. A typical research question in this area might be: "Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?" In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Survey_research" title="Survey research">survey research</a> by <a href="/wiki/Paul_Lazarsfeld" title="Paul Lazarsfeld">Paul Lazarsfeld</a>. A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and <a href="/wiki/Moisey_Ostrogorsky" title="Moisey Ostrogorsky">Moisey Ostrogorsky</a>.</p>
<p>Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_movements" title="Social movements">social movements</a> and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.</p>
<p>Political sociology has also moved beyond <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Methodological_nationalism&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Methodological nationalism (page does not exist)">methodological nationalism</a> and analysed the role of non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_construct" title="Social construct">social construct</a>, and the role of <a href="/wiki/Statelessness" title="Statelessness">stateless entities</a> in the modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_society" title="World society">world society</a>.

<p>Demographers or sociologists of population study the size, composition and change over time of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study of population is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as <a href="/wiki/Mobilities" title="Mobilities">Mobilities</a> studies and is closely related to <a href="/wiki/Human_geography" title="Human geography">human geography</a>.

<p>Public sociology refers to an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences.

<p>The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_religion" title="Philosophy of religion">philosophy of religion</a> in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what <a href="/wiki/Peter_L._Berger" title="Peter L.

It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology <i>began</i> with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 <a href="/wiki/Suicide_(book)" title="Suicide (book)">study of suicide</a> rates among <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> populations.

<p>The sociology of change and development attempts to understand how societies develop and how they can be changed.

In contemporary studies of social change, there is overlaps with <a href="/wiki/International_development" title="International development">international development</a> or <a href="/wiki/Community_development" title="Community development">community development</a>. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marx" title="Marx">Marx</a> contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while <a href="/wiki/Weber" title="Weber">Weber</a> argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances.

<p>A social network is a <a href="/wiki/Social_structure" title="Social structure">social structure</a> composed of individuals (or organizations) called "nodes", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interdependency" title="Interdependency">interdependency</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Friendship" title="Friendship">friendship</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kinship" title="Kinship">kinship</a>, financial exchange, dislike, <a href="/wiki/Sexual_network" title="Sexual network">sexual relationships</a>, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communities" title="Communities">communities</a> to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from <a href="/wiki/Relational_sociology" title="Relational sociology">relational sociology</a>, social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by <a href="/wiki/Omar_Lizardo" title="Omar Lizardo">Omar Lizardo</a> also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes.

<p>Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, <a href="/wiki/Caste" title="Caste">castes</a>, and divisions within a society. Modern <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western societies</a> stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">lower class</a>, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Occupational_prestige" title="Occupational prestige">occupational</a>). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of <a href="/wiki/Structural_functionalism" title="Structural functionalism">structural functionalism</a> suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conflict_theory" title="Conflict theory">Conflict theorists</a>, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of <a href="/wiki/Social_mobility" title="Social mobility">social mobility</a> in stratified societies.</p>
<p>Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> in the capitalist system: the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> own the means, but this effectively includes the <a href="/wiki/Proletariat" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a> itself as the workers can only sell their own <a href="/wiki/Labour_power" title="Labour power">labour power</a> (forming the <a href="/wiki/Base_and_superstructure" title="Base and superstructure">material base of the cultural superstructure</a>). Max Weber critiqued Marxist <a href="/wiki/Economic_determinism" title="Economic determinism">economic determinism</a>, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Patriarchy" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a>). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu" title="Pierre Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a> provides a modern example in the concepts of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_capital" title="Cultural capital">cultural</a> and <a href="/wiki/Symbolic_capital" title="Symbolic capital">symbolic capital</a>. Theorists such as <a href="/wiki/Ralf_Dahrendorf" title="Ralf Dahrendorf">Ralf Dahrendorf</a> have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as <a href="/wiki/Dependency_theory" title="Dependency theory">dependency theory</a>, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Urban_sociology" title="Urban sociology">Urban sociology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rural_sociology" title="Rural sociology">Rural sociology</a></div>
<p>Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a>, works such as <a href="/wiki/Georg_Simmel" title="Georg Simmel">Georg Simmel</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Metropolis_and_Mental_Life" title="The Metropolis and Mental Life">The Metropolis and Mental Life</a></i> (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The <a href="/wiki/Chicago_school_(sociology)" title="Chicago school (sociology)">Chicago School</a> produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing <a href="/wiki/Symbolic_interactionism" title="Symbolic interactionism">symbolic interactionism</a> as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a>, for instance, in <a href="/wiki/Saskia_Sassen" title="Saskia Sassen">Saskia Sassen</a>'s study of the "<a href="/wiki/Global_city" title="Global city">Global city</a>". Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Community_sociology">Community sociology</span></h4>
<p>Often grouped with urban and rural sociology is that of community sociology or the sociology of community. Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_T%C3%B6nnies" title="Ferdinand Tönnies">Ferdinand Tönnies</a> distinguished between two types of human association: <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gemeinschaft" title="Gemeinschaft">Gemeinschaft</a></i> (usually translated as "community") and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gesellschaft" title="Gesellschaft">Gesellschaft</a></i> ("society" or "association"). In his 1887 work, <i>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft</i>, Tönnies argued that <i>Gemeinschaft</i> is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a "unity of will". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Development_sociology&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Development sociology (page does not exist)">development sociology</a>, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of <a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Violence">Violence</span></h3>
<p>The late political theorist <a href="/wiki/Hannah_Arendt" title="Hannah Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a> wrote widely on the connection between power and <a href="/wiki/Violence" title="Violence">violence</a>, in particular her book <i><a href="/wiki/Hannah_Arendt#On_Violence" title="Hannah Arendt">On Violence</a></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_academic_disciplines">Other academic disciplines</span></h2>
<p>Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_work" title="Social work">social work</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_philosophy" title="Social philosophy">social philosophy</a>. Many comparatively new fields such as <a href="/wiki/Communication_studies" title="Communication studies">communication studies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cultural_studies" title="Cultural studies">cultural studies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Demography" title="Demography">demography</a> and <a href="/wiki/Literary_theory" title="Literary theory">literary theory</a>, draw upon methods that originated in sociology. The terms "<a href="/wiki/Social_science" title="Social science">social science</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Social_research" title="Social research">social research</a>" have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology. The distinct field of <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">social psychology</a> emerged from the many intersections of sociological and psychological interests, and is further distinguished in terms of <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology_(sociology)" title="Social psychology (sociology)">sociological</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_psychology_(psychology)" title="Social psychology (psychology)">psychological emphasis</a>.</p>
<p>Sociology and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Applied_sociology" title="Applied sociology">applied sociology</a> are connected to the professional and academic discipline of <a href="/wiki/Social_work" title="Social work">social work</a>. Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual. However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems. For example, a sociologist might study <i>why</i> a community is plagued with poverty. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Applied_sociology" title="Applied sociology">applied sociologist</a> would be more focused on practical strategies on <i>what</i> needs to be done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on <i>action</i>; implementing theses strategies <a href="/wiki/Clinical_social_work" title="Clinical social work">"directly"</a> or <a href="/wiki/Community_practice" title="Community practice">"indirectly"</a> by means of <a href="/wiki/Mental_health" title="Mental health">mental health therapy</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Counseling" title="Counseling">counselling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Advocacy" title="Advocacy">advocacy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Community_organization" title="Community organization">community organization</a> or <a href="/wiki/Community_mobilization" title="Community mobilization">community mobilization</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Social_anthropology" title="Social anthropology">Social anthropology</a> is the branch of <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in <a href="/wiki/Social_group" title="Social group">social groups</a>. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of <a href="/wiki/Social_organization" title="Social organization">social organization</a>. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sociobiology" title="Sociobiology">Sociobiology</a> is the study of how <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_behaviour" title="Social behaviour">social behaviour</a> and organization have been influenced by <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Biological_process" title="Biological process">biological process</a>. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Zoology" title="Zoology">zoology</a>. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see '<a href="/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture" title="Nature versus nurture">nature versus nurture</a>'). <a href="/wiki/Entomology" title="Entomology">Entomologist</a> <a href="/wiki/E._O._Wilson" title="E. O. Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology. Besides Sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Irving_Louis_Horowitz" title="Irving Louis Horowitz">Irving Louis Horowitz</a>, in his <i>The Decomposition of Sociology</i> (1994), has argued that the discipline, while arriving from a "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs." Furthermore: "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential." Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. <a href="/wiki/Randall_Collins" title="Randall Collins">Randall Collins</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dorothy_Swaine_Thomas" title="Dorothy Swaine Thomas">Dorothy Swaine Thomas</a> Professor in Sociology at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the <a href="/wiki/Social_Evolution_%26_History" title="Social Evolution &amp; History">Social Evolution &amp; History</a> journal, has voiced similar sentiments: "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other."</p>
<p>In 2007, <i><a href="/wiki/Times_Higher_Education" title="Times Higher Education">The Times Higher Education Guide</a></i> published a list of 'The most cited authors of books in the Humanities' (including philosophy and psychology).
