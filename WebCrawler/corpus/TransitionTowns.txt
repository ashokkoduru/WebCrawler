<p>The terms <b>transition town</b>, <b>transition initiative</b> and <b>transition model</b> refer to <a href="/wiki/Grassroots" title="Grassroots">grassroot</a> <a href="/wiki/Community_project" title="Community project">community projects</a> that aim to increase self-sufficiency to reduce the potential effects of <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_destruction" title="Climate destruction">climate destruction</a>, and economic instability. The Transition Network, founded in 2006, inspired the creation of many of the projects. A number of the groups have officially registered with the organisation. The first initiative to use the name was Transition Town Totnes, located in the United Kingdom. Transition initiatives have been started in locations around the world, with many located in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and Australia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The term, "transition town" was coined by Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne.</p>
<p>The transition model can be applied to different types of places where people live, such as villages, regions, islands and towns. The generic term is "transition initiative", which includes transition neighborhoods, communities, and cities, although "transition town" is in common usage.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_Kinsale_to_Totnes">From Kinsale to Totnes</span></h3>

<p>In 2004, <a href="/wiki/Permaculture" title="Permaculture">permaculture</a> designer <a href="/wiki/Rob_Hopkins" title="Rob Hopkins">Rob Hopkins</a> set his students at <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Kinsale_Further_Education_College&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Kinsale Further Education College (page does not exist)">Kinsale Further Education College</a> the task of applying permaculture principles to the concept of <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>. The output of this student project was the ‘Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan'.</p>
<p>This looked at across-the-board creative adaptations in the realms of energy production, health, education, economy and agriculture as a "road map" to a sustainable future for the town. Two of his students, Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne, developed the <i>Transition towns</i> concept. They then presented their ideas to Kinsale Town Council. The councilors decided to adopt the plan and work towards energy independence.</p>
<p>Hopkins moved to his hometown of <a href="/wiki/Totnes" title="Totnes">Totnes</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, where he and Naresh Giangrande developed these concepts into the transition model. In 2006 Transition Town Totnes become the first Transition initiative.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transition_Network_founded">Transition Network founded</span></h3>
<p>Between late 2006 and early 2007 the Transition Network was founded as a UK charity by British permaculture educator Rob Hopkins. It trains and supports people involved with Transition initiatives. It disseminates the concepts of transition towns.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2008_to_present_day">2008 to present day</span></h3>
<p>In 2008 the number of communities involved in the project had increased with many localities in the process of becoming "official" Transition towns.</p>
<p>The initiative spread and by May 2010 there were over 400 community initiatives recognized as official Transition towns in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>. The term <i>transition initiatives</i> become common to reflect the range and type of communities involved - e.g. villages (<a href="/wiki/Kinsale#Transition_towns" title="Kinsale">Kinsale</a>), neighbourhoods of cities (<a href="/wiki/Portobello,_Edinburgh" title="Portobello, Edinburgh">Portobello</a>, Edinburgh), through council districts (<a href="/wiki/Penwith" title="Penwith">Penwith</a>) to cities and city boroughs (<a href="/wiki/Brixton" title="Brixton">Brixton</a>).</p>
<p>By September 2013, there were 1130 initiatives registered (462 Official, 654 Muller) in 43 countries.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Influences">Influences</span></h2>
<p>Influences include <a href="/wiki/Permaculture" title="Permaculture">permaculture</a> concepts as described in <a href="/wiki/Bill_Mollison" title="Bill Mollison">Bill Mollison</a>’s <i>Permaculture, a Designers Manual (1988)</i> and <a href="/wiki/David_Holmgren" title="David Holmgren">David Holmgren</a>’s <i>Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability (2003),</i> as well as <a href="/wiki/David_Fleming_(writer)" title="David Fleming (writer)">David Fleming</a>'s work on community, culture and resilience.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>
<p>Each Transition town or initiative has a high level of <a href="/wiki/Autonomy" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a>. However, to be called an official initiative certain criteria must be met. Additionally, there is nothing to stop an 'unofficial' initiative using ideas inspired by Transition towns. Further, there are various 'hubs' to co-ordinate work at a regional level.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transition_Network">Transition Network</span></h3>
<p>The Transition Network is a UK charity founded between late 2006 and early 2007. It was set up to disseminate the concept of the Transition towns. It has published books and films, trained people and facilitated <a href="/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">networking</a>. The network's website contains a listing of the initiatives that have registered there.</p>
<p>Some of the material has been translated and adapted to other languages/cultures, including <a class="extiw" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cidades_em_Transi%C3%A7%C3%A3o" title="pt:Cidades em Transição">Portuguese</a>, Danish, <a class="extiw" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Towns" title="de:Transition Towns">German</a>, Dutch, Spanish, <a class="extiw" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ville_en_transition" title="fr:Ville en transition">French</a>, Hungarian, <a class="extiw" href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citt%C3%A0_di_transizione" title="it:Città di transizione">Italian</a>, Japanese and Irish.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transition_US">Transition US</span></h3>
<p>In the United States, Transition initiatives have been started in many communities. Transition US is the national hub. Its stated vision <i>"that every community in the United States will have engaged its collective creativity to unleash an extraordinary and historic transition to a future beyond fossil fuels; a future that is more vibrant, abundant and resilient; one that is ultimately preferable to the present"</i>.</p>
<p>Transition US is a resource and catalyst for building resilient communities across the United States that are able to withstand severe energy, climate or economic shocks while creating a better quality of life in the process. They are accomplishing this mission by inspiring, encouraging, supporting, networking and training individuals and their communities as they consider, adopt, adapt, and implement the transition approach to community empowerment and change.</p>
<p>A large number of state sites have also been set up using the <a href="/wiki/Ning_(website)" title="Ning (website)">Ning social networking platform</a>. These state sites, under the umbrella of a national <a href="/wiki/Ning_(website)" title="Ning (website)">Ning</a> site, were set up to help facilitate, network, inform, monitor, and house regional and organizational Transition initiatives. Thus, furthering the spread of the Transition Movement while networking related organizations, projects, ideas and activities. In addition, many Transition initiatives can be found on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WiserEarth" title="WiserEarth">WiserEarth</a> community.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Guidance_for_new_groups">Guidance for new groups</span></h3>
<p>Some projects use the TN's guide the '12 ingredients', or the 'revised ingredients', when setting up their group.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Features">Features</span></h2>
<p>The Transition Network (TN) promotes awareness of sustainable living and building local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Resilience_(ecology)" title="Resilience (ecology)">ecological resilience</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Peak_oil_and_local_resilience">Peak oil and local resilience</span></h3>
<p><i>The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resiliency</i> by Rob Hopkins provides much of the framework behind the Transition Initiative and outlines ways for local Transition Towns to get involved.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transportation">Transportation</span></h3>
<p>Communities are encouraged to seek out methods for reducing energy usage as well as reducing their reliance on long supply chains that are totally dependent on fossil fuels for essential items (see <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_transport#Environmental_calculator_of_the_French_environment_and_energy_agency" title="Sustainable transport">environmental calculator</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_production">Food production</span></h3>
<p>Food is a key area for transition, sometimes the slogan "Food feet, not <a href="/wiki/Food_miles" title="Food miles">food miles</a>" is used. Initiatives so far have included creating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Community_garden" title="Community garden">community gardens</a> or replacing ornamental tree plantings with fruit or nut trees, to grow food.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Waste_and_recycling">Waste and recycling</span></h3>
<p>Business waste exchange seeks to match the waste of one industry with another industry that uses that waste material, sometimes referred to as <a href="/wiki/Industrial_symbiosis" title="Industrial symbiosis">industrial symbiosis</a>. Repairing old items rather than throwing them away is looked at.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychology">Psychology</span></h3>
<p>The Transition Network proposes an alternative from business as usual, or from 'shocked/doomladen' reactions to <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a> and an end to unlimited economic growth. According to Southend-on-Sea in Transition, <i>"...by shifting our mind-set we can actually recognise the coming post-cheap oil era as an opportunity rather than a threat, and design the future low carbon age to be thriving, resilient and abundant — somewhere much better to live than our current alienated consumer culture based on greed, war and the myth of perpetual growth."</i></p>
<p>A theme of the Transition Network is acknowledging the emotional impact of changing to a low energy world. Some Transition Network groups have 'Heart and Soul' groups to look at this aspect.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_descent_action_plans_.28EDAP.29">Energy descent action plans (EDAP)</span></h3>
<p>An important aim for Transition towns is to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. One way to further this goal is for the community to develop an EDAP. The term "community" in this context includes local people, local institutions, local agencies and the local council. The first comprehensive plan was created for Totnes in 2010, entitled <i>Transition in Action: Totnes &amp; District 2030</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, where the movement is called <i>Villes et Territoires en Transition</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Association_n%C3%A9gaWatt" title="Association négaWatt">association négaWatt</a> provides a theoretical support to the transition movement.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h3>
<p>As of 2010, the TN includes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" title="Financial crisis of 2007–08">global financial crisis</a> as further threat to local communities, alongside peak oil and climate change. To counter economic instability the TN promotes <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_localism" title="Fiscal localism">fiscal localism</a>. The organisation see <a href="/wiki/Local_currency" title="Local currency">local</a> <a href="/wiki/Complementary_currency" title="Complementary currency">complementary currencies</a> as a way to create sustainable local economies. Local currencies existing or under development include:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Methods">Methods</span></h3>
<p>While the focus and aims remain the same, the methods used to achieve these vary. For example, Totnes has introduced its own <a href="/wiki/Local_currency" title="Local currency">local currency</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Totnes_pound" title="Totnes pound">Totnes pound</a>, which is redeemable in local shops and businesses, helping to reduce "food miles" while also supporting local firms. This idea is also planned to be introduced in three <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Welsh</a> transition towns and in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maleny" title="Maleny">Maleny</a> <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, the Baroon Dollar as a part of a regional transition towns project.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_popular_culture">In popular culture</span></h2>
<p>Transition towns have been featured in the plot line of the long-running <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_4" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Archers" title="The Archers">The Archers</a></i>. This is an example of mainstream media attention the movement got after a couple of years of being founded.</p>
