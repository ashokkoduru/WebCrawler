<p><b>Methanol</b>, also known as <b>methyl alcohol</b> among others, is a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">chemical</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_formula" title="Chemical formula">formula</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">C</a><a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">H</a><sub>3</sub><a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">O</a><a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">H</a> (often abbreviated MeOH). Methanol acquired the name "wood alcohol" because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the <a href="/wiki/Destructive_distillation" title="Destructive distillation">destructive distillation</a> of wood. Today, industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>Methanol is the simplest <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, being only a <a href="/wiki/Methyl_group" title="Methyl group">methyl group</a> linked to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroxyl" title="Hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group. It is a light, <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" title="Volatility (chemistry)">volatile</a>, colorless, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flammable" title="Flammable">flammable</a> liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> (drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption. At room temperature, it is a <a href="/wiki/Solvent#Solvent_classifications" title="Solvent">polar liquid</a>, and is used as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antifreeze_(coolant)" title="Antifreeze (coolant)">antifreeze</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a>, and as a <a href="/wiki/Denaturation_(food)" title="Denaturation (food)">denaturant</a> for <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>. It is also used for producing <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> via <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a> reaction.</p>
<p>Methanol is produced naturally in the <a href="/wiki/Anaerobic_organism" title="Anaerobic organism">anaerobic</a> <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolism</a> of many varieties of bacteria, and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment. As a result, the atmosphere contains a small amount of methanol vapor. But in only a few days, atmospheric methanol is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidized" title="Oxidized">oxidized</a> by sunlight to produce carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>Methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star forming regions of space, and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions. It is detected through its spectral emission lines.</p>
<p>Methanol when drunk is <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolized</a> first to <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> and then to <a href="/wiki/Formic_acid" title="Formic acid">formic acid</a> or <a href="/wiki/Formate" title="Formate">formate</a> salts. These are poisonous to the central nervous system and may result in blindness, coma, and death. Because of these toxic properties, methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses. This addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol (commonly known as "<a href="/wiki/Denatured_alcohol" title="Denatured alcohol">denatured alcohol</a>" or "methylated spirit") from liquor <a href="/wiki/Excise_tax_in_the_United_States" title="Excise tax in the United States">excise taxation</a> in the US and some other countries.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_industry">Chemical industry</span></h3>
<p>Methanol is primarily used in making other chemicals. About 40% of methanol is converted to <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a>, and from there into products as diverse as plastics, <a href="/wiki/Plywood" title="Plywood">plywood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paint" title="Paint">paints</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Explosive" title="Explosive">explosives</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Permanent_press" title="Permanent press">permanent press</a> textiles.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, a process was developed by <a href="/wiki/Mobil" title="Mobil">Mobil</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methanol_to_gasoline" title="Methanol to gasoline">producing gasoline</a> fuel for vehicles. One such industrial facility was built at <a href="/wiki/Motunui" title="Motunui">Motunui</a> in New Zealand in the 1980s. In the 1990s, large amounts of methanol were used in the United States to produce the gasoline additive <a href="/wiki/Methyl_tert-butyl_ether" title="Methyl tert-butyl ether">methyl tert-butyl ether</a> (MTBE). While MTBE is no longer marketed in the U.S., it is still widely used in other parts of the world. Methanol (or less commonly, <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>) is a component in the <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a> of <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglycerides</a> for production of <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>.</p>
<p>Other chemical derivatives of methanol include <a href="/wiki/Dimethyl_ether" title="Dimethyl ether">dimethyl ether</a> (DME), which has replaced <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbons</a> as an <a href="/wiki/Aerosol_spray#Aerosol_propellants" title="Aerosol spray">aerosol spray propellant</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Acetic_acid" title="Acetic acid">acetic acid</a>. Dimethyl ether can be blended with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liquified_petroleum_gas" title="Liquified petroleum gas">liquified petroleum gas</a> (LPG) for home heating and cooking, and can be used as a replacement for transportation diesel fuel.</p>
<p>Of high interest to the <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> marketplace, methanol is an important ingredient in new and lower-cost methods for producing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propylene" title="Propylene">propylene</a>, which is <a href="/wiki/Market_tightness" title="Market tightness">much in demand</a>. Such methods include Methanol-to-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Olefins" title="Olefins">Olefins</a> (MTO), Methanol-to-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propylene" title="Propylene">Propylene</a> (MTO/MTP), Metathesis, Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), High Severity FCC, and Olefins Cracking.</p>
<p>The market for proponyl became tight when the <a href="/wiki/Ethane" title="Ethane">ethane</a> prices fell in the USA with the exploration of shale gas reserves. The low priced <a href="/wiki/Ethylene" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a> produced from this raw material has given chemical producers in North America a feedstock advantage. Such change has put <a href="/wiki/Naphtha" title="Naphtha">naphtha</a>-fed steam crackers at a disadvantageous position, with many of them shutting down or revamping to use <a href="/wiki/Ethane" title="Ethane">ethane</a> as feedstock. Nevertheless, the propylene output rates from ethane-fed crackers are negligible.</p>

<p>Methanol is occasionally used to fuel <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engines</a>. Pure methanol is required by rule to be used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Champcars" title="Champcars">Champcars</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monster_Trucks" title="Monster Trucks">Monster Trucks</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Automobile_Club" title="United States Automobile Club">USAC</a> sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, <i>etc.</i>), and other dirt track series, such as <a href="/wiki/World_of_Outlaws" title="World of Outlaws">World of Outlaws</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Motorcycle_Speedway" title="Motorcycle Speedway">Motorcycle Speedway</a>, mainly because, in the event of an accident, methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radio_controlled_model" title="Radio controlled model">radio control</a>, <a href="/wiki/Control_line" title="Control line">control line</a>, <a href="/wiki/Free_flight_(model_aircraft)" title="Free flight (model aircraft)">free flight</a> <a href="/wiki/Model_aircraft" title="Model aircraft">airplanes</a>, cars and trucks; such engines use a <a href="/wiki/Platinum" title="Platinum">platinum</a> filament <a href="/wiki/Glow_plug_(model_engine)" title="Glow plug (model engine)">glow plug</a> that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. <a href="/wiki/Drag_racing" title="Drag racing">Drag racers</a>, mud racers, and heavily modified <a href="/wiki/Tractor_pulling" title="Tractor pulling">tractor pullers</a> also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Top_Alcohol_Dragster" title="Top Alcohol Dragster">Top Alcohol Dragster</a> and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the <a href="/wiki/Indianapolis_500" title="Indianapolis 500">Indianapolis 500</a> had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.</p>
<p>Methanol burns in <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, including open air, forming carbon dioxide and water:</p>

<p>One problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrode</a> some metals, particularly aluminium. An acid, albeit weak, methanol attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminum from corrosion:</p>

<p>The resulting <a href="/wiki/Methoxide" title="Methoxide">methoxide</a> salts are soluble in methanol, resulting in a clean aluminium surface, which is readily oxidized by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dissolved_oxygen" title="Dissolved oxygen">dissolved oxygen</a>. Also, the methanol can act as an oxidizer:</p>

<p>This reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>OH is negligible. Methanol's corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors.</p>
<p>Organic methanol, produced from wood or other organic materials (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioalcohol" title="Bioalcohol">bioalcohol</a>), has been suggested as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a>. Low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors.</p>
<p>Methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation. The chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel.</p>

<p>Pure methanol has been used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_wheel_car" title="Open wheel car">open wheel auto racing</a> since the mid-1960s. Unlike petroleum fires, methanol fires can be <a href="/wiki/Active_fire_protection" title="Active fire protection">extinguished</a> with plain water. A methanol-based fire burns invisibly, unlike gasoline, which burns with a visible flame. If a fire occurs on the track, there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers, but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression. The decision to permanently switch to methanol in American <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Championship_Car_Racing" title="American Championship Car Racing">IndyCar</a> racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the <a href="/wiki/1964_Indianapolis_500" title="1964 Indianapolis 500">1964 Indianapolis 500</a>, which killed drivers <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Sachs" title="Eddie Sachs">Eddie Sachs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dave_MacDonald" title="Dave MacDonald">Dave MacDonald</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_carrier">Energy carrier</span></h3>
<p>Methanol is useful as an <a href="/wiki/Energy_carrier" title="Energy carrier">energy carrier</a> because it is easier to store than hydrogen and burns cleaner than fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Methanol is readily biodegradable in both aerobic (oxygen present) and anaerobic (oxygen absent) environments. Methanol will not persist in the environment. The half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days (such as <a href="/wiki/Benzene" title="Benzene">benzene</a> at 10–730 days). Since methanol is <a href="/wiki/Miscibility" title="Miscibility">miscible</a> with water and biodegradable, it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.</p>

<p>Methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol, the product being known as "<a href="/wiki/Denatured_alcohol" title="Denatured alcohol">denatured alcohol</a>" or "methylated spirit". This was commonly used during the <a href="/wiki/Prohibition" title="Prohibition">Prohibition</a> to discourage consumption of <a href="/wiki/Moonshine" title="Moonshine">bootlegged</a> liquor, and ended up causing several deaths.</p>
<p>Methanol is used as a <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> and as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antifreeze_(coolant)" title="Antifreeze (coolant)">antifreeze</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipelines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Windshield_washer_fluid" title="Windshield washer fluid">windshield washer fluid</a>.</p>
<p>In some <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">wastewater treatment plants</a>, a small amount of methanol is added to <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> to provide a carbon food source for the <a href="/wiki/Denitrifying_bacteria" title="Denitrifying bacteria">denitrifying bacteria</a>, which convert <a href="/wiki/Nitrate" title="Nitrate">nitrates</a> to <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifers</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, methanol was used as a fuel in several German military rocket designs, under the name M-Stoff, and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with <a href="/wiki/Hydrazine" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a>, known as <a href="/wiki/C-Stoff" title="C-Stoff">C-Stoff</a>.</p>
<p>Methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct-methanol_fuel_cell" title="Direct-methanol fuel cell">Direct-methanol fuel cells</a> are unique in their low temperature, atmospheric pressure operation, allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree.

<p>Methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves. Methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner, so alcohol stoves are often very simple, sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel. This lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness. Similarly, the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling, as with the brand "<a href="/wiki/Sterno" title="Sterno">Sterno</a>".</p>
<p>Methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_injection_(engines)" title="Water injection (engines)">water methanol injection</a>.</p>

<p>Small amounts of methanol is a natural endogenous compound found in normal, healthy humans. A study found a mean of 4.5 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">ppm</a> in the exhaled breath of subjects. The mean endogenous methanol production in humans of 0.45 g/d may be metabolized from <a href="/wiki/Pectin" title="Pectin">pectin</a> found in fruit; one <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a> of apple produces up to 1.4 g methanol.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_synthesis_gas">From synthesis gas</span></h3>
<p>Carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol. Today, the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and <a href="/wiki/Zinc_oxide" title="Zinc oxide">zinc oxides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catalyst_support" title="Catalyst support">supported</a> on alumina, as first used by <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Chemical_Industries" title="Imperial Chemical Industries">ICI</a> in 1966. At 5–10 MPa (50–100 atm) and 250 °C (482 °F), the reaction is characterized by high selectivity (&gt;99.8%):</p>

<p>Since the production of synthesis gas from methane produces three <a href="/wiki/Mole_(unit)" title="Mole (unit)">moles</a> of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide, whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide. One way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> into the methanol synthesis reactor, where it, too, reacts to form methanol according to the equation:</p>

<p>In terms of mechanism, the process occurs via initial conversion of CO into CO<sub>2</sub>, which is then <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenated</a>:</p>

<p>where the H<sub>2</sub>O byproduct is recycled via the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_gas_shift_reaction" title="Water gas shift reaction">water-gas shift reaction</a></p>

<p>This gives an overall reaction, which is the same as listed above.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h3>
<p>The catalytic conversion of methane to methanol has long been sought as a route to methanol. This route is effected by enzymes such as <a href="/wiki/Methane_monooxygenase" title="Methane monooxygenase">methane monooxygenases</a> but commercial routes remain elusive because of the tendency for over-oxidation, i.e., methanol is more readily oxidized than is methane.</p>

<p>Methanol is available commercially in various purity grades for fine chemicals:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Synthesis" quality (corresponding to normal commercial methanol)</li>
<li>Certified analytical quality</li>
<li>Extremely pure qualities for semiconductor manufacture</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Commercial_methanol">Commercial methanol</span></h3>
<p>In addition to laboratory grades, commercial methanol is generally classified according to ASTM purity grades A and AA. Methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to Grade AA. In addition to water, typical impurities include acetone and ethanol (which are very difficult to separate by distillation). When methanol is delivered by ships or tankers used to transport other substances, contamination by the previous cargo must be expected. Comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient, quick test method for deciding whether a batch can be accepted and loaded. Traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances, as well as a large number of other compounds, can be detected. Further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range, density, permanganate number, turbidity, color index, and acid number. More comprehensive tests include water determination according to the Karl Fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts. However, the latter is relatively expensive and time-consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present.</p>

The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Suffix_(linguistics)" title="Suffix (linguistics)">suffix</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/-yl" title="-yl">-yl</a> used in <a href="/wiki/Organic_chemistry" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemistry</a> to form names of <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> groups, was extracted from the word "methyl".</p>
<p>In 1923, the German chemists <a href="/wiki/Alwin_Mittasch" title="Alwin Mittasch">Alwin Mittasch</a> and Mathias Pier, working for <a href="/wiki/BASF" title="BASF">Badische-Anilin &amp; Soda-Fabrik</a>(BASF), developed a means to convert <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">synthesis gas</a> (a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>) into methanol. US patent 1,569,775 was applied for on 4 Sep 1924 and issued on 12 January 1926; the process used a <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manganese_oxide" title="Manganese oxide">manganese oxide</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> with extremely vigorous conditions—pressures ranging from 50 to 220 <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)" title="Atmosphere (unit)">atm</a>, and temperatures up to 450 °C. Modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts (commonly copper) capable of operating at lower pressures. The modern low pressure methanol (LPM) was developed by ICI in the late 1960s <span class="citation patent"><a class="external text" href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US3326956" rel="nofollow">US 3326956</a></span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Apatent&amp;rft.number=3326956&amp;rft.cc=US&amp;rft.title="><span style="display: none;"> </span></span> with the technology now owned by Johnson Matthey, which is a leading licensor of methanol technology.</p>
<p>Methanol is one of the most heavily traded chemical commodities in the world, with an estimated global demand of around 27 to 29 million metric tons. In recent years, production capacity has expanded considerably, with new plants coming on-stream in South America, China and the Middle East, the latter based on access to abundant supplies of methane gas. Even though nameplate production capacity (coal-based) in China has grown significantly, operating rates are estimated to be as low as 50 to 60%. No new production capacity is scheduled to come on-stream until 2015.</p>
<p>The main applications for methanol are the production of <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> (used in construction and wooden boarding), acetic acid (basis for a.o. PET-bottles), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MTBE" title="MTBE">MTBE</a> (fuel component and replacement for the very volatile <a href="/wiki/Diethyl_ether" title="Diethyl ether">diethyl ether</a>) and more recently for the formation of methyl <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">esters</a> in the production of bio-diesel. In China, demand is expected to grow exponentially, not only caused by a growing internal market of the traditional applications, but accelerated by new applications, such as direct blending (with gasoline), Methanol-To-Olefins (e.g. propylene) and DME. Methanol can also be used to produce gasoline.</p>

<p>The use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the oil crises of the 1970s due to its availability, low cost, and environmental benefits. By the mid-1990s, over 20,000 methanol "flexible fuel vehicles" capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the U.S. In addition, low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in Europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s. Automakers stopped building methanol FFVs by the late-1990s, switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles. While the methanol FFV program was a technical success, rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished the interest in methanol fuels.</p>
