<p><b>Sugar</b> is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbohydrates" title="Carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a>, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called <a href="/wiki/Monosaccharide" title="Monosaccharide">monosaccharides</a> and include <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> (also known as dextrose), <a href="/wiki/Fructose" title="Fructose">fructose</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Galactose" title="Galactose">galactose</a>. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is <a href="/wiki/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Disaccharide" title="Disaccharide">disaccharide</a>. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include <a href="/wiki/Maltose" title="Maltose">maltose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lactose" title="Lactose">lactose</a>. Longer chains of sugars are called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oligosaccharides" title="Oligosaccharides">oligosaccharides</a>. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low-calorie" title="Low-calorie">lower-calorie</a> food substitutes for sugar described as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Artificial_sweetener" title="Artificial sweetener">artificial sweeteners</a>.</p>
<p>Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants, but are present in sufficient concentrations for efficient extraction only in <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a>. Sugarcane refers to any of several species of giant grass in the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum" title="Saccharum">Saccharum</a></i> that have been cultivated in tropical climates in <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> since ancient times. A great expansion in its production took place in the 18th century with the establishment of sugar plantations in the West Indies and Americas. This was the first time that sugar became available to the common people, who had previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. Sugar beet, a <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivated variety</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Beta_vulgaris" title="Beta vulgaris">Beta vulgaris</a></i>, is grown as a root crop in cooler climates and became a major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. Sugar production and trade have changed the course of human history in many ways, influencing the formation of colonies, the perpetuation of <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, the transition to indentured labour, the migration of peoples, wars between sugar-trade–controlling nations in the 19th century, and the ethnic composition and political structure of the <a href="/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a>.</p>
<p>The world produced about 168 million tonnes of sugar in 2011. The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year (33.1 kg in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialised_countries" title="Industrialised countries">industrialised countries</a>), equivalent to over 260 food calories per person, per day.</p>
<p>Since the latter part of the twentieth century, it has been questioned whether a diet high in sugars, especially refined sugars, is good for human health. Sugar has been linked to obesity, and suspected of, or fully implicated as a cause in the occurrence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, macular degeneration, and tooth decay. Numerous studies have been undertaken to try to clarify the position, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that do not consume or are largely free of any sugar consumption.</p>

It most probably came to England by way of Italian merchants. The contemporary Italian word is <i>zucchero</i>, whereas the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> words, <i>azúcar</i> and <i>açúcar</i> respectively, have kept a trace of the <a href="/wiki/Arabic_definite_article" title="Arabic definite article">Arabic definite article</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_times_and_Middle_Ages">Ancient times and Middle Ages</span></h3>

<p>Sugar has been produced in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and <a href="/wiki/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> was more often used for sweetening in most parts of the world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane was a native of tropical <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with <i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum_barberi" title="Saccharum barberi">Saccharum barberi</a></i> originating in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum_edule" title="Saccharum edule">S. edule</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum_officinarum" title="Saccharum officinarum">S. officinarum</a></i> coming from <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.</p>
<p>Sugar was found in Europe by the 1st century AD, but only as an imported medicine, and not as a food. The Greek physician <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dioscorides" title="Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> in the 1st century (AD) described sugar in his medical treatise <a href="/wiki/De_Materia_Medica" title="De Materia Medica">De Materia Medica</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, a 1st century (AD) Roman, described sugar in his <a href="/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)" title="Natural History (Pliny)">Natural History</a>: "Sugar is made in Arabia as well, but Indian sugar is better. It is a kind of honey found in cane, white as gum, and it crunches between the teeth. It comes in lumps the size of a hazelnut. Sugar is used only for medical purposes."</p>
<p>Sugar remained relatively unimportant until the Indians discovered methods of turning <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane_juice" title="Sugarcane juice">sugarcane juice</a> into granulated crystals that were easier to store and to transport. Crystallized sugar was discovered by the time of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gupta_dynasty" title="Gupta dynasty">Imperial Guptas</a>, around the 5th century AD. In the local Indian language, these crystals were called <i>khanda</i> (<a href="/wiki/Devanagari" title="Devanagari">Devanagari</a>:खण्ड,<span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Khaṇḍa</span>), which is the source of the word <i>candy</i>.</p>
<p>Indian sailors, who carried <a href="/wiki/Clarified_butter" title="Clarified butter">clarified butter</a> and sugar as supplies, introduced knowledge of sugar on the various <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trade_routes" title="Trade routes">trade routes</a> they travelled. Buddhist monks, as they travelled around, brought sugar crystallization methods to China. During the reign of <a href="/wiki/Harsha" title="Harsha">Harsha</a> (r. 606–647) in <a href="/wiki/North_India" title="North India">North India</a>, Indian envoys in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang China</a> taught methods of cultivating sugarcane after <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Taizong_of_Tang" title="Emperor Taizong of Tang">Emperor Taizong of Tang</a> (r. 626–649) made known his interest in sugar. China then established its first sugarcane plantations in the seventh century. Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 AD, to obtain technology for sugar refining. In South Asia, the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, sugar became a staple of cooking and <a href="/wiki/Dessert" title="Dessert">desserts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Crusades" title="Crusades">Crusaders</a> brought sugar home with them to Europe after their campaigns in the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Land" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a>, where they encountered caravans carrying "sweet salt". Early in the 12th century, Venice acquired some villages near <a href="/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon" title="Tyre, Lebanon">Tyre</a> and set up estates to produce sugar for export to Europe, where it supplemented honey, which had previously been the only available sweetener. Crusade chronicler <a href="/wiki/William_of_Tyre" title="William of Tyre">William of Tyre</a>, writing in the late 12th century, described sugar as "very necessary for the use and health of mankind".

When he finally sailed, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane, which became the first to reach the New World.</p>
<p>The first sugar cane harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.</p>

<p>Sugar was a luxury in Europe until the 18th century, when it became more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be considered a necessity. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The demand for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indentured_labor" title="Indentured labor">indentured laborers</a> from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the demand for sugar.</p>
<p>Sugar also led to some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a> of areas where sugar cane was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that sugar cane could be cultivated in British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, sugar factories were established in <a href="/wiki/Bihar" title="Bihar">Bihar</a> in eastern India.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, sugar beet production increased in continental Europe because of the difficulty of importing sugar when shipping was subject to <a href="/wiki/Blockade" title="Blockade">blockade</a>. By 1880, the sugar beet was the main source of sugar in Europe. It was cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.</p>
<p>Until the late nineteenth century, sugar was purchased in <a href="/wiki/Sugarloaf" title="Sugarloaf">loaves</a>, which had to be cut using implements called <a href="/wiki/Sugar_nips" title="Sugar nips">sugar nips</a>. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags.</p>
<p>Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the <a href="/wiki/Moravia" title="Moravia">Moravian</a> <a href="/wiki/Jakub_Kry%C5%A1tof_Rad" title="Jakub Kryštof Rad">Jakub Kryštof Rad</a>, director of a sugar company in <a href="/wiki/Da%C4%8Dice" title="Dačice">Dačice</a>.

<p>Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as <a href="/wiki/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a>). <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enzymes" title="Enzymes">Enzymes</a> must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolized</a>.

Many pentoses and hexoses can form <a href="/wiki/Heterocyclic_compound" title="Heterocyclic compound">ring structures</a>. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sugar_beet">Sugar beet</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">Sugar beet</a> (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) is a <a href="/wiki/Biennial_plant" title="Biennial plant">biennial plant</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">Family</a> <a href="/wiki/Amaranthaceae" title="Amaranthaceae">Amaranthaceae</a>, the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant. Here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Milk_of_lime" title="Milk of lime">Milk of lime</a> is added to the raw juice and <a href="/wiki/Carbonatation" title="Carbonatation">carbonatated</a> in a number of stages in order to purify it. Water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum. The syrup is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The white sugar that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried. It requires no further refining.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sugarcane">Sugarcane</span></h3>
<p>Sugarcane (<i>Saccharum spp.</i>) is a <a href="/wiki/Perennial_plant" title="Perennial plant">perennial</a> grass in the family <a href="/wiki/Poaceae" title="Poaceae">Poaceae</a>. It is cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical regions for the sucrose that is found in its stems. It requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant's great growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant. Here, it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is then clarified with <a href="/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide" title="Calcium hydroxide">lime</a> and heated to destroy <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a>. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed by evaporation in vacuum containers. The resulting <a href="/wiki/Supersaturation" title="Supersaturation">supersaturated</a> solution is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried. <a href="/wiki/Molasses" title="Molasses">Molasses</a> is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as <a href="/wiki/Bagasse" title="Bagasse">bagasse</a>, is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> or can be treated in a <a href="/wiki/Carbonatation" title="Carbonatation">carbonatation</a> process to produce a whiter product. About 2,500 litres (660 US gal) of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Refining">Refining</span></h3>

<p>Refined sugar is made from raw sugar that has undergone a <a href="/wiki/Refining" title="Refining">refining</a> process to remove the <a href="/wiki/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a>. Raw sugar is a <a href="/wiki/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a> which is synthesized from sugarcane or <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a> and cannot immediately be consumed before going through the refining process to produce refined sugar or white sugar.</p>
<p>The sugar may be transported in bulk to the country where it will be used and the refining process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a <a href="/wiki/Carbonatation" title="Carbonatation">carbonatation</a> or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of colour is achieved by using either a granular <a href="/wiki/Activated_carbon" title="Activated carbon">activated carbon</a> or an <a href="/wiki/Ion-exchange_resin" title="Ion-exchange resin">ion-exchange resin</a>. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses. The <a href="/wiki/International_Commission_for_Uniform_Methods_of_Sugar_Analysis" title="International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis">International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis</a> sets standards for the measurement of the purity of refined sugar, known as ICUMSA numbers; lower numbers indicate a higher level of purity in the refined sugar.</p>

<p>Refined sugar is widely used for industrial needs for higher quality. Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500). The level of purity associated with the colors of sugar, expressed by standard number <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ICUMSA" title="ICUMSA">ICUMSA</a> (International Commission for Uniform Methods of sugar Analysis), the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate that higher purity of sugar.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Producing_countries">Producing countries</span></h3>
<p>The five largest producers of sugar in 2011 were <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, India, the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, China and <a href="/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. In the same year, the largest exporter of sugar was Brazil, distantly followed by Thailand, Australia and India. The largest importers were the European Union, United States and Indonesia. At present, Brazil has the highest <a href="/wiki/Per_capita" title="Per capita">per capita</a> consumption of sugar, followed by Australia, Thailand, and the European Union.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Forms_and_uses">Forms and uses</span></h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Brown_sugar" title="Brown sugar">Brown sugars</a> are granulated sugars, either containing residual molasses, or with the grains deliberately coated with molasses to produce a light- or dark-colored sugar. They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and <a href="/wiki/Toffee" title="Toffee">toffees</a>.</li>
<li>Granulated sugars are used at the table, to sprinkle on foods and to sweeten hot drinks, and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to cooked products. They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and <a href="/wiki/Marmalade" title="Marmalade">marmalades</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Inverted_sugar_syrup" title="Inverted sugar syrup">Invert sugars</a> and syrups are blended to manufacturers specifications and are used in breads, cakes, and beverages for adjusting sweetness, aiding moisture retention and avoiding crystallization of sugars.</li>

</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumption">Consumption</span></h2>
<p>In most parts of the world, sugar is an important part of the human diet, making food more palatable and providing <a href="/wiki/Food_energy" title="Food energy">food energy</a>. After cereals and vegetable oils, sugar derived from sugarcane and beet provided more kilocalories per capita per day on average than other food groups. According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FAO" title="FAO">FAO</a>, an average of 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar, equivalent to over 260 food calories per day, was consumed annually per person of all ages in the world in 1999. Even with rising human populations, sugar consumption is expected to increase to 25.1 kilograms (55 lb) per person per year by 2015.</p>
<p>Data collected in multiple nationwide surveys between 1999 and 2008 show that the intake of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Added_sugars" title="Added sugars">added sugars</a> has declined by 24 percent with declines occurring in all age, ethnic and income groups.</p>

<p>The per capita consumption of refined sugar in the United States has varied between 27 and 46 kilograms (60 and 101 lb) in the last 40 years. In 2008, American per capita total consumption of sugar and sweeteners, exclusive of artificial sweeteners, equalled 61.9 kg (136 lb) per year. This consisted of 29.65 kg (65.4 lb) pounds of refined sugar and 31 kg (68.3 lb) pounds of corn-derived sweeteners per person.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h2>
<p>Some studies involving the health impact of sugars are effectively inconclusive. The FAO meta studies and <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">WHO</a> studies have shown directly contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms. Hence, there are articles such as <i><a href="/wiki/Consumer_Reports" title="Consumer Reports">Consumer Reports</a> on Health</i> that stated in 2008, "Some of the supposed dietary dangers of sugar have been overblown. Many studies have debunked the idea that it causes hyperactivity, for example".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Addiction">Addiction</span></h3>
<p>Sugar addiction is the term for the relationship between sugar and the various aspects of <a href="/wiki/Food_addiction" title="Food addiction">food addiction</a> including "<a href="/wiki/Binge_eating" title="Binge eating">bingeing</a>, withdrawal, craving and cross-sensitization". Some scientists assert that consumption of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sweets" title="Sweets">sweets</a> or sugar could have a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opioid_dependence" title="Opioid dependence">heroin addiction</a>-like effect.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alzheimer.27s_disease">Alzheimer's disease</span></h3>
<p>Claims have been made of a sugar–<a href="/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease" title="Alzheimer's disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> connection, but debate continues over whether cognitive decline is attributable to dietary fructose or to overall energy intake.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Blood_glucose_levels">Blood glucose levels</span></h3>
<p>Carbohydrates are classified according to their <a href="/wiki/Glycemic_index" title="Glycemic index">glycemic index</a>, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and <a href="/wiki/Glycemic_load" title="Glycemic load">glycemic load</a>, which takes into account both the glycemic index and the amount of carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cardiovascular_disease">Cardiovascular disease</span></h3>
<p>Studies in animals have suggested that chronic consumption of refined sugars can contribute to metabolic and <a href="/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease" title="Cardiovascular disease">cardiovascular dysfunction</a>. Some experts have suggested that refined fructose is more damaging than refined glucose in terms of cardiovascular risk. Cardiac performance has been shown to be impaired by switching from a carbohydrate diet including fiber to a high-carbohydrate diet. Switching from saturated <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a> to carbohydrates with high <a href="/wiki/Glycemic_index" title="Glycemic index">glycemic index</a> values shows a statistically-significant increase in the risk of <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</a>. Other studies have shown that the risk of developing <a href="/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease" title="Coronary artery disease">coronary heart disease</a> is decreased by adopting a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids but low in sugar, whereas a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet brings no reduction. This suggests that consuming a diet with a high <a href="/wiki/Glycemic_load" title="Glycemic load">glycemic load</a> typical of the "<a href="/wiki/Junk_food" title="Junk food">junk food</a>" diet is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>The consumption of added sugars has been positively associated with multiple measures known to increase cardiovascular disease risk amongst adolescents as well as adults. Studies are suggesting that the impact of refined carbohydrates or high glycemic load carbohydrates are more significant than the impact of saturated fatty acids on cardiovascular disease. A high dietary intake of sugar (in this case, sucrose or disaccharide) can substantially increase the risk of heart and vascular diseases. According to a Swedish study of <span class="nowrap">4301 people</span> undertaken by <a href="/wiki/Lund_University" title="Lund University">Lund University</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malm%C3%B6_University_College" title="Malmö University College">Malmö University College</a>, sugar was associated with higher levels of bad <a href="/wiki/Blood_lipids" title="Blood lipids">blood lipids</a>, causing a high level of small and medium <a href="/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein" title="Low-density lipoprotein">low-density lipoprotein</a> (LDL) and reduced <a href="/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein" title="High-density lipoprotein">high-density lipoprotein</a> (HDL). In contrast, the amount of fat eaten did not affect the level of blood fats. Incidentally quantities of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">alcohol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> were linked to an increase in the good HDL blood fat.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hyperactivity">Hyperactivity</span></h3>
<p>There is a common notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in particular in children, but studies and meta-studies tend to disprove this. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results are to be expected when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally "sugar-sensitive." They were randomly assigned to <a href="/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups" title="Treatment and control groups">experimental and control groups</a>. In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a <a href="/wiki/Placebo" title="Placebo">placebo</a>. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obesity_and_diabetes">Obesity and diabetes</span></h3>
<p>Controlled trials have now shown unequivocally that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increases body weight and body fat, and that replacement of sugar by artificial sweeteners reduces weight. Studies on the link between sugars and diabetes are inconclusive, with some suggesting that eating excessive amounts of sugar does not increase the risk of <a href="/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus" title="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</a>, although the extra calories from consuming large amounts of sugar can lead to <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, which may itself increase the risk of developing this <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metabolic_disease" title="Metabolic disease">metabolic disease</a>. Other studies show correlation between refined sugar (free sugar) consumption and the onset of diabetes, and negative correlation with the consumption of <a href="/wiki/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">fiber</a>. These included a 2010 meta-analysis of eleven studies involving 310,819 participants and 15,043 cases of <a href="/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2" title="Diabetes mellitus type 2">type 2 diabetes</a>. This found that "SSBs (<a href="/wiki/Sweetened_beverage" title="Sweetened beverage">sugar-sweetened beverages</a>) may increase the risk of <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome" title="Metabolic syndrome">metabolic syndrome</a> and type 2 diabetes not only through obesity but also by increasing dietary glycemic load, leading to <a href="/wiki/Insulin_resistance" title="Insulin resistance">insulin resistance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beta_cell" title="Beta cell">β-cell</a> dysfunction, and inflammation". As an overview to consumption related to chronic disease and obesity, the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s independent meta-studies specifically distinguish free sugars ("all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices") from sugars occurring naturally in food. The reports prior to 2000 set the limits for free sugars at a maximum of 10% of carbohydrate intake, measured by energy, rather than mass, and since 2002 have aimed for a level across the entire population of less than 10%. The consultation committee recognized that this goal is "controversial. However, the Consultation considered that the studies showing no effect of free sugars on excess weight have limitations".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tooth_decay">Tooth decay</span></h3>
<p>In regard to contributions to <a href="/wiki/Dental_caries" title="Dental caries">tooth decay</a>, the role of free sugars is also recommended to be below an absolute maximum of 10% of energy intake, with a minimum of zero. There is "convincing evidence from human intervention studies, epidemiological studies, animal studies and experimental studies, for an association between the amount and frequency of free sugars intake and dental caries" while other sugars (complex carbohydrate) consumption is normally associated with a lower rate of dental caries. Lower rates of tooth decay have been seen in individuals with <a href="/wiki/Hereditary_fructose_intolerance" title="Hereditary fructose intolerance">hereditary fructose intolerance</a>.</p>
<p>Also, studies have shown that the consumption of sugar and starch have different impacts on oral health with the ingestion of starchy foods and fresh fruit being associated with low levels of dental caries.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recommended_dietary_intake">Recommended dietary intake</span></h2>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization_(WHO)" title="World Health Organization (WHO)">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> recommends  that both adults and children reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. A reduction to below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially in what regards dental caries. These recommendations were based on the totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight and dental caries.</p>
<p>Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measurements">Measurements</span></h2>
<p>Various culinary sugars have different densities due to differences in particle size and inclusion of moisture.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domino_Sugar" title="Domino Sugar">Domino Sugar</a> gives the following weight to volume conversions (in <a href="/wiki/United_States_customary_units" title="United States customary units">United States customary units</a>):</p>
