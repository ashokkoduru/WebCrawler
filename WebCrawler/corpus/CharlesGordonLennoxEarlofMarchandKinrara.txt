<p>March moved from London to the family seat Goodwood to take over management of the estate, following the family tradition of the duke handing over management of the estate to the heir apparent when the latter turns forty.</p>
<p>Motor sport at Goodwood was started by his grandfather, <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Gordon-Lennox,_9th_Duke_of_Richmond" title="Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond">Freddie Richmond</a>, who opened the Goodwood Motor Circuit in 1948. March established the Festival of Speed at Goodwood House in 1993. He then brought motor racing back to the circuit, which had closed in 1966, with the creation of the Goodwood Revival in 1998. Both events have since become recognised  as some of the most unusual, exciting and creative events in the world.</p>
