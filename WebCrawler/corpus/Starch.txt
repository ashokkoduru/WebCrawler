<p><b>Starch</b> or <b>amylum</b> is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polymeric" title="Polymeric">polymeric</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> consisting of a large number of <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> units joined by <a href="/wiki/Glycosidic_bond" title="Glycosidic bond">glycosidic bonds</a>. This <a href="/wiki/Polysaccharide" title="Polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> is produced by most green <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a> as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple foods</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Potato" title="Potato">potatoes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a> (corn), <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cassava" title="Cassava">cassava</a>.</p>
<p>Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and <a href="/wiki/Helix" title="Helix">helical</a> <a href="/wiki/Amylose" title="Amylose">amylose</a> and the branched <a href="/wiki/Amylopectin" title="Amylopectin">amylopectin</a>. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight. <a href="/wiki/Glycogen" title="Glycogen">Glycogen</a>, the glucose store of animals, is a more branched version of amylopectin.</p>
<p>In industry, starch is converted into sugars, for example by <a href="/wiki/Malt" title="Malt">malting</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fermentation" title="Fermentation">fermented</a> to produce <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> in the manufacture of <a href="/wiki/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Whisky" title="Whisky">whisky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>. It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods. Dissolving starch in warm water gives <a href="/wiki/Wheatpaste" title="Wheatpaste">wheatpaste</a>, which can be used as a thickening, stiffening or gluing agent. The biggest industrial non-food use of starch is as an adhesive in the <a href="/wiki/Papermaking" title="Papermaking">papermaking</a> process. Starch can be applied to parts of some garments before ironing, to <a href="#Clothing_starch">stiffen them</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word "starch" is from a <a href="/wiki/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic</a> root with the meanings "strong, stiff, strengthen, stiffen". Modern German <i>Stärke</i> (starch) is related.</p>
<p>"Amylum" for starch is from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> αμυλον, "amylon" which means "not ground at a mill". The root <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amyl" title="wikt:amyl">amyl</a> is used in biochemistry for several compounds related to starch.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Starch grains from the <a href="/wiki/Rhizome" title="Rhizome">rhizomes</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Typha" title="Typha">Typha</a></i> (cattails, bullrushes) as <a href="/wiki/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> have been identified from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grinding_stone" title="Grinding stone">grinding stones</a> in Europe dating back to 30,000 years ago. Starch grains from <a href="/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a> were found on grind stones in caves in <a href="/wiki/Ngalue" title="Ngalue">Ngalue</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mozambique" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> dating up to 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Pure extracted wheat starch paste was used in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> possibly to glue <a href="/wiki/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a>. The extraction of starch is first described in the <i><a href="/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)" title="Natural History (Pliny)">Natural History</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> around AD 77–79. Romans used it also in cosmetic creams, to powder the hair and to thicken sauces. Persians and Indians used it to make dishes similar to gothumai wheat <a href="/wiki/Halva" title="Halva">halva</a>. Rice starch as surface treatment of paper has been used in paper production in China, from 700 AD onwards.</p>
<p>In addition to starchy plants consumed directly, 66 million tonnes of starch were being produced per year world-wide by 2008. In the EU this was around 8.5 million tonnes, with around 40% being used for industrial applications and 60% for food uses, most of the latter as <a href="/wiki/Glucose_syrup" title="Glucose syrup">glucose syrups</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_store_of_plants">Energy store of plants</span></h2>

<p>Most green plants use starch as their energy store. An exception is the family <a href="/wiki/Asteraceae" title="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> (asters, daisies and sunflowers), where starch is replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Fructan" title="Fructan">fructan</a> <a href="/wiki/Inulin" title="Inulin">inulin</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, plants use light energy to produce <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> from <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. The glucose is used to make <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a> fibers, the structural component of the plant, or is stored in the form of starch granules, in <a href="/wiki/Amyloplast" title="Amyloplast">amyloplasts</a>. Toward the end of the growing season, starch accumulates in twigs of trees near the buds. <a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">Fruit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhizome" title="Rhizome">rhizomes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tuber" title="Tuber">tubers</a> store starch to prepare for the next growing season.</p>
<p>Glucose is soluble in water, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrophilic" title="Hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a>, binds with water and then takes up much space and is <a href="/wiki/Osmosis" title="Osmosis">osmotically</a> active; glucose in the form of starch, on the other hand, is not soluble, therefore osmotically inactive and can be stored much more compactly.</p>
<p>Glucose molecules are bound in starch by the easily <a href="/wiki/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolyzed</a> <a href="/wiki/Glycosidic_bond" title="Glycosidic bond">alpha bonds</a>. The same type of bond is found in the animal reserve polysaccharide <a href="/wiki/Glycogen" title="Glycogen">glycogen</a>. This is in contrast to many structural polysaccharides such as <a href="/wiki/Chitin" title="Chitin">chitin</a>, cellulose and <a href="/wiki/Peptidoglycan" title="Peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a>, which are bound by <a href="/wiki/Glycosidic_bond" title="Glycosidic bond">beta bonds</a> and are much more resistant to hydrolysis.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biosynthesis">Biosynthesis</span></h3>
<p>Plants produce starch by first converting <a href="/wiki/Glucose_1-phosphate" title="Glucose 1-phosphate">glucose 1-phosphate</a> to <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate" title="Adenosine diphosphate">ADP</a>-glucose using the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Glucose-1-phosphate_adenylyltransferase" title="Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase">glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase</a>. This step requires energy in the form of <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>. The enzyme <a href="/wiki/Starch_synthase" title="Starch synthase">starch synthase</a> then adds the ADP-glucose via a 1,4-alpha <a href="/wiki/Glycosidic_bond" title="Glycosidic bond">glycosidic bond</a> to a growing chain of glucose residues, liberating <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate" title="Adenosine diphosphate">ADP</a> and creating amylose. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Starch_branching_enzyme" title="Starch branching enzyme">Starch branching enzyme</a> introduces 1,6-alpha glycosidic bonds between these chains, creating the branched amylopectin. The starch debranching enzyme <a href="/wiki/Isoamylase" title="Isoamylase">isoamylase</a> removes some of these branches. Several <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isoform" title="Isoform">isoforms</a> of these enzymes exist, leading to a highly complex synthesis process.</p>
<p>Glycogen and amylopectin have similar structure, but the former has about one branch point per ten 1,4-alpha bonds, compared to about one branch point per thirty 1,4-alpha bonds in amylopectin. Amylopectin is synthesized from ADP-glucose while mammals and fungi synthesize glycogen from <a href="/wiki/Uridine_diphosphate_glucose" title="Uridine diphosphate glucose">UDP-glucose</a>; for most cases, bacteria synthesize glycogen from <a class="external text" href="http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?C00498" rel="nofollow">ADP-glucose</a> (analogous to starch).</p>
<p>In addition to starch synthesis in plants, starch can be synthesized from non-food starch mediated by an enzyme cocktail. In this cell-free biosystem, beta-1,4-glycosidic bond-linked cellulose is partially hydrolyzed to <a href="/wiki/Cellobiose" title="Cellobiose">cellobiose</a>. <a href="/wiki/Cellobiose_phosphorylase" title="Cellobiose phosphorylase">Cellobiose phosphorylase</a> cleaves to glucose 1-phosphate and glucose; the other enzyme—potato <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Alpha-glucan_phosphorylase&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Alpha-glucan phosphorylase (page does not exist)">alpha-glucan phosphorylase</a> can add a glucose unit from glucose 1-phosphorylase to the non-ruducing ends of starch. In it, phosphate is internally recycled. The other product, glucose, can be assimilated by a yeast. This cell-free bioprocessing does not need any costly chemical and energy input, can be conducted in aqueous solution, and does not have sugar losses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Degradation">Degradation</span></h3>
<p>Starch is synthesized in plant leaves during the day, in order to serve as an energy source at night. Starch is stored as granules. The insoluble, highly branched starch chains have to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phosphorylated" title="Phosphorylated">phosphorylated</a> in order to be accessible for degrading enzymes. The enzyme <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glucan,_water_dikinase" title="Glucan, water dikinase">glucan, water dikinase</a> (GWD) phosphorylates at the C-6 position of a glucose molecule, close to the chains 1,6-alpha branching bonds. A second enzyme, <a href="/wiki/Phosphoglucan,_water_dikinase" title="Phosphoglucan, water dikinase">phosphoglucan, water dikinase</a> (PWD) phosphorylates the glucose molecule at the C-3 position. A loss of these enzymes, for example a loss of the GWD, leads to a starch excess (sex) phenotype, and because starch cannot be phosphorylated, it accumulates in the plastids.</p>
<p>After the phosphorylation, the first degrading enzyme, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beta-amylase" title="Beta-amylase">beta-amylase</a> (BAM) can attack the glucose chain at its non-reducing end. <a href="/wiki/Maltose" title="Maltose">Maltose</a> is released as the main product of starch degradation. If the glucose chain consists of three or fewer molecules, BAM cannot release maltose. A second enzyme, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Disproportionating_enzyme-1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Disproportionating enzyme-1 (page does not exist)">disproportionating enzyme-1</a> (DPE1), combines two maltotriose molecules. From this chain, a glucose molecule is released. Now, BAM can release another maltose molecule from the remaining chain. This cycle repeats until starch is degraded completely. If BAM comes close to the phosphorylated branching point of the glucose chain, it can no longer release maltose. In order for the phosphorylated chain to be degraded, the enzyme isoamylase (ISA) is required.</p>
<p>The products of starch degradation are predominantly maltose and smaller amounts of glucose. These molecules are exported from the plastid to the cytosol, maltose via the maltose transporter, which if mutated (MEX1-mutant) results in maltose accumulation in the plastid. Glucose is exported via the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Plastidic_glucose_translocator&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Plastidic glucose translocator (page does not exist)">plastidic glucose translocator</a> (pGlcT). These two sugars act as a precursor for sucrose synthesis. Sucrose can then be used in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the mitochondria, to generate ATP at night.</p>

<p>While amylose was traditionally thought to be completely unbranched, it is now known that some of its molecules contain a few branch points. Although in absolute mass only about one quarter of the starch granules in plants consist of amylose, there are about 150 times more amylose molecules than amylopectin molecules. Amylose is a much smaller molecule than amylopectin.</p>
<p>Starch molecules arrange themselves in the plant in semi-crystalline granules. Each plant species has a unique starch granular size: <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Rice_starch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Rice starch (page does not exist)">rice starch</a> is relatively small (about 2μm) while <a href="/wiki/Potato_starch" title="Potato starch">potato starches</a> have larger granules (up to 100μm).</p>
<p>Starch becomes soluble in water when heated. The granules swell and burst, the semi-crystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule, forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixture's <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a>. This process is called <a href="/wiki/Starch_gelatinization" title="Starch gelatinization">starch gelatinization</a>. During <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a>, the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity. During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste, the semi-crystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens, expelling water. This is mainly caused by <a href="/wiki/Retrogradation_(starch)" title="Retrogradation (starch)">retrogradation</a> of the amylose. This process is responsible for the hardening of bread or <a href="/wiki/Staling" title="Staling">staling</a>, and for the water layer on top of a starch gel (<a href="/wiki/Syneresis_(chemistry)" title="Syneresis (chemistry)">syneresis</a>).</p>
<p>Some cultivated plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose, known as <i>waxy starches</i>. The most used is <a href="/wiki/Waxy_corn" title="Waxy corn">waxy maize</a>, others are <a href="/wiki/Glutinous_rice" title="Glutinous rice">glutinous rice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Waxy_potato_starch" title="Waxy potato starch">waxy potato starch</a>. Waxy starches have less retrogradation, resulting in a more stable paste. High amylose starch, <a href="/wiki/Amylomaize" title="Amylomaize">amylomaize</a>, is cultivated for the use of its gel strength and for use as a <a href="/wiki/Resistant_starch" title="Resistant starch">resistant starch</a> (a starch that resists digestion) in food products.</p>
<p>Synthetic amylose made from cellulose has a well-controlled degree of polymerization. Therefore, it can be used as a potential drug deliver carrier.</p>
<p>Certain starches, when mixed with water, will produce a <a href="/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid#Oobleck" title="Non-Newtonian fluid">non-newtonian fluid</a> sometimes nicknamed "oobleck".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrolysis">Hydrolysis</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> that break down or <a href="/wiki/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolyze</a> starch into the constituent sugars are known as <a href="/wiki/Amylase" title="Amylase">amylases</a>.</p>
<p>Alpha-amylases are found in plants and in animals. Human <a href="/wiki/Saliva" title="Saliva">saliva</a> is rich in amylase, and the <a href="/wiki/Pancreas" title="Pancreas">pancreas</a> also secretes the enzyme. Individuals from populations with a high-starch diet tend to have more amylase genes than those with low-starch diets;</p>
<p>Beta-amylase cuts starch into <a href="/wiki/Maltose" title="Maltose">maltose</a> units. This process is important in the digestion of starch and is also used in <a href="/wiki/Brewing" title="Brewing">brewing</a>, where amylase from the skin of seed grains is responsible for converting starch to maltose (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malting" title="Malting">Malting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mashing" title="Mashing">Mashing</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dextrinization">Dextrinization</span></h3>
<p>If starch is subjected to dry heat, it breaks down to form <a href="/wiki/Dextrin" title="Dextrin">dextrins</a>, also called "pyrodextrins" in this context. This break down process is known as dextrinization. (Pyro)dextrins are mainly yellow to brown in color and dextrinization is partially responsible for the browning of toasted bread.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Iodine_test" title="Iodine test">Iodine test</a></div>

<p>A triiodide (I<sub>3</sub>) solution formed by mixing <a href="/wiki/Iodine" title="Iodine">iodine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iodide" title="Iodide">iodide</a> (usually from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potassium_iodine" title="Potassium iodine">potassium iodide</a>) is used to test for starch; a dark blue color indicates the presence of starch. The details of this reaction are not yet fully known, but it is thought that the iodine (I<sub>3</sub> and I<sub>5</sub> ions) fit inside the coils of <a href="/wiki/Amylose" title="Amylose">amylose</a>, the charge transfers between the iodine and the starch, and the energy level spacings in the resulting complex correspond to the absorption spectrum in the visible light region. The strength of the resulting blue color depends on the amount of amylose present. Waxy starches with little or no amylose present will color red.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Starch_indicator" title="Starch indicator">Starch indicator</a> solution consisting of water, starch and iodide is often used in <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">redox</a> titrations: in the presence of an <a href="/wiki/Oxidizing_agent" title="Oxidizing agent">oxidizing agent</a> the solution turns blue, in the presence of <a href="/wiki/Reducing_agent" title="Reducing agent">reducing agent</a> the blue color disappears because <a href="/wiki/Triiodide" title="Triiodide">triiodide</a> (I<sub>3</sub>) ions break up into three iodide ions, disassembling the starch-iodine complex.

It is made by adding 3 grams of soluble starch to 1 liter of heated water; the solution is cooled before use (starch-iodine complex becomes unstable at temperatures above 35 °C).</p>
<p>Each species of plant has a unique type of starch granules in granular size, shape and crystallization pattern.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Starch_industry">Starch industry</span></h3>
<p>The starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cornstarch" title="Cornstarch">cornstarch</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tapioca" title="Tapioca">tapioca</a>, wheat, <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potato_starch" title="Potato starch">potato starch</a>. To a lesser extent, sources include rice, sweet potato, sago and mung bean. Historically, <a href="/wiki/Florida_arrowroot" title="Florida arrowroot">Florida arrowroot</a> was also commercialized. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.</p>
<p>Untreated starch requires heat to thicken or gelatinize. When a starch is pre-cooked, it can then be used to thicken instantly in cold water. This is referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Starch_gelatinization" title="Starch gelatinization">pregelatinized starch</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Starch_sugars">Starch sugars</span></h4>
<p>Starch can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrolyzed" title="Hydrolyzed">hydrolyzed</a> into simpler carbohydrates by <a href="/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acids</a>, various <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a>, or a combination of the two. The resulting fragments are known as <a href="/wiki/Dextrin" title="Dextrin">dextrins</a>. The extent of conversion is typically quantified by <i><b><a href="/wiki/Dextrose_equivalent" title="Dextrose equivalent">dextrose equivalent</a></b></i> (DE), which is roughly the fraction of the <a href="/wiki/Glycosidic_bond" title="Glycosidic bond">glycosidic bonds</a> in starch that have been broken.</p>
<p>These starch sugars are by far the most common starch based food ingredient and are used as sweetener in many drinks and foods. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Maltodextrin" title="Maltodextrin">Maltodextrin</a>, a lightly hydrolyzed (DE 10–20) starch product used as a bland-tasting filler and thickener.</li>
<li>Various <a href="/wiki/Glucose_syrup" title="Glucose syrup">glucose syrups</a> (DE 30–70), also called <a href="/wiki/Corn_syrup" title="Corn syrup">corn syrups</a> in the US, viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dextrose" title="Dextrose">Dextrose</a> (DE 100), commercial glucose, prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch.</li>
<li>High <a href="/wiki/Fructose" title="Fructose">fructose</a> syrup, made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glucose_isomerase" title="Glucose isomerase">glucose isomerase</a>, until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose. In the United States sugar prices are two to three times higher than in the rest of the world, which makes <a href="/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup" title="High fructose corn syrup">high fructose corn syrup</a> significantly cheaper, so that it is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_as_food_additive">Use as food additive</span></h4>
<p>As an additive for <a href="/wiki/Food_processing" title="Food processing">food processing</a>, food starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings, custards, soups, sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and salad dressings, and to make noodles and pastas. Function as thickeners, extenders, emulsion stabilizers and are exceptional binders in processed meats.</p>
<p>Gummed sweets such as <a href="/wiki/Jelly_bean" title="Jelly bean">jelly beans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wine_gum" title="Wine gum">wine gums</a> are not manufactured using a mold in the conventional sense. A tray is filled with native starch and leveled. A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1,000 or so jelly beans. The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put into a stove to set. This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_in_pharmaceutical_industry">Use in pharmaceutical industry</span></h4>
<p>In the pharmaceutical industry, starch is also used as an <a href="/wiki/Excipient" title="Excipient">excipient</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Tablet_(pharmacy)" title="Tablet (pharmacy)">tablet</a> disintegrant or as binder.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Resistant_starch" title="Resistant starch">Resistant starch</a> is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. High amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through <a href="/wiki/Baking" title="Baking">baking</a>, mild <a href="/wiki/Food_extrusion" title="Food extrusion">extrusion</a> and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble <a href="/wiki/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">dietary fiber</a> in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits. Published studies have shown that Type 2 resistant corn helps to improve insulin sensitivity, increases satiety and improves markers of colonic function. It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Papermaking">Papermaking</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Papermaking" title="Papermaking">Papermaking</a> is the largest non-food application for starches globally, consuming millions of metric tons annually. In a typical sheet of copy paper for instance, the starch content may be as high as 8%. Both chemically modified and unmodified starches are used in papermaking. In the wet part of the papermaking process, generally called the "wet-end", the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer. These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers / <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a> and inorganic fillers. Cationic starches together with other retention and internal <a href="/wiki/Sizing" title="Sizing">sizing</a> agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process (<a href="/wiki/Wet_strength" title="Wet strength">wet strength</a>), and to provide strength to the final paper sheet (dry strength).</p>
<p>In the dry end of the papermaking process, the paper web is rewetted with a starch based solution. The process is called <a href="/wiki/Sizing" title="Sizing">surface sizing</a>. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses (size presses). Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or "size" for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings as one of the binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners. <a href="/wiki/Coated_paper" title="Coated paper">Coated paper</a> has improved smoothness, hardness, whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Corrugated_board_adhesives">Corrugated board adhesives</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corrugated_board" title="Corrugated board">Corrugated board</a> adhesives are the next largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glue" title="Glue">glues</a> are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as <a href="/wiki/Borax" title="Borax">borax</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caustic_soda" title="Caustic soda">caustic soda</a>. Part of the starch is gelatinized to carry the slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the fluting. The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes the rest of the uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Clothing_starch">Clothing starch</span></h3>
<p>Clothing or laundry starch is a liquid that is prepared by mixing a vegetable starch in water (earlier preparations also had to be boiled), and is used in the <a href="/wiki/Laundry" title="Laundry">laundering</a> of <a href="/wiki/Clothing" title="Clothing">clothes</a>. Starch was widely used in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and <a href="/wiki/Ruff_(clothing)" title="Ruff (clothing)">ruffs</a> of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's <a href="/wiki/Shirt" title="Shirt">shirts</a> and the ruffles of girls' <a href="/wiki/Petticoat" title="Petticoat">petticoats</a> by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being <a href="/wiki/Ironing" title="Ironing">ironed</a>. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. <a href="/wiki/Dust" title="Dust">Dirt</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sweat" title="Sweat">sweat</a> from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today, the product is sold in <a href="/wiki/Aerosol_spray" title="Aerosol spray">aerosol cans</a> for home use.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h3>
<p>Another large non-food starch application is in the construction industry, where starch is used in the gypsum <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wall_board" title="Wall board">wall board</a> manufacturing process. Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily <a href="/wiki/Gypsum" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>. Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation, and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid wall board. The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering, and also provide rigidity to the board.</p>
<p>Starch is used in the manufacture of various <b>adhesives</b> or glues for book-binding, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wallpaper_adhesive" title="Wallpaper adhesive">wallpaper adhesives</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paper_bag#Multiwall_paper_sacks" title="Paper bag">paper sack</a> production, tube winding, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gum_tape" title="Gum tape">gummed paper</a>, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soda_ash" title="Soda ash">soda ash</a>, which are mixed with the starch solution at 50–70 °C (122–158 °F) to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.</p>
