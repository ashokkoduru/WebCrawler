A <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a>, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a>, which in turn is converted into <a href="/wiki/Lignite" title="Lignite">lignite</a>, then sub-bituminous coal, after that <a href="/wiki/Bituminous_coal" title="Bituminous coal">bituminous coal</a>, and lastly <a href="/wiki/Anthracite" title="Anthracite">anthracite</a>. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time.</p>
<p>Throughout history, coal has been used as an energy resource, primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. Coal is the largest source of energy for the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">generation of electricity</a> worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthropogenic" title="Anthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> sources of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> releases. The extraction of coal, its use in energy production and its byproducts are all associated with <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_the_coal_industry" title="Environmental impact of the coal industry">environmental</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_worker%27s_pneumoconiosis" title="Coal worker's pneumoconiosis">health effects</a> including <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">Climate change</a>.</p>
<p>Coal is extracted from the ground by <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">coal mining</a>. Since 1983, the world's top coal producer has been China. In 2011 China produced 3,520 million tonnes of coal – 49.5% of 7,695 million tonnes world coal production. In 2011 other large producers were United States (993 million tonnes), India (589), European Union (576) and Australia (416). In 2010 the largest exporters were Australia with 328 million tonnes (27.1% of world coal export) and Indonesia with 316 million tonnes (26.1%), while the largest importers were Japan with 207 million tonnes (17.5% of world coal import), China with 195 million tonnes (16.6%) and South Korea with 126 million tonnes (10.7%).</p>

<p>The word originally took the form <i>col</i> in <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a>, from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proto-Germanic" title="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> *<i>kula</i>(<i>n</i>), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proto-Indo-European" title="Proto-Indo-European">Proto-Indo-European</a> root *<i>g</i>(<i>e</i>)<i>u-lo-</i> "live coal". <a href="/wiki/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic</a> cognates include the <a href="/wiki/Old_Frisian" title="Old Frisian">Old Frisian</a> <i>kole</i>, <a href="/wiki/Middle_Dutch" title="Middle Dutch">Middle Dutch</a> <i>cole</i>, <a href="/wiki/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> <i>kool</i>, <a href="/wiki/Old_High_German" title="Old High German">Old High German</a> <i>chol</i>, <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> <i>Kohle</i> and <a href="/wiki/Old_Norse" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a> <i>kol</i>, and the <a href="/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a> word <i>gual</i> is also a cognate via the <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a> root. In Old Turkic languages, <i>kül</i> is "ash(es), cinders", <i>öčür</i> is "quench". The compound "charcoal" in Turkic is <i>öčür(ülmüş) kül</i>, literally "quenched ashes, cinders, coals" with elided anlaut <i>ö-</i> and inflection affixes <i>-ülmüş</i>.</p>
<p>The word took on the meaning "mineral consisting of fossilized carbon" in the thirteenth century.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Formation">Formation</span></h2>

<p>At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from <a href="/wiki/Biodegradation" title="Biodegradation">biodegradation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidation</a>, usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peat_bog" title="Peat bog">peat bogs</a> that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.</p>
<p>The wide, shallow seas of the <a href="/wiki/Carboniferous" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods. The exception is the coal gap in the <a href="/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event" title="Permian–Triassic extinction event">Permian–Triassic extinction event</a>, where coal is rare. Coal is known from <a href="/wiki/Precambrian" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> strata, which predate land plants — this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Lignite" title="Lignite">Lignite</a>, or brown coal, is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation. <a href="/wiki/Jet_(lignite)" title="Jet (lignite)">Jet</a>, a compact form of lignite, is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Upper_Palaeolithic" title="Upper Palaeolithic">Upper Palaeolithic</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Bituminous_coal" title="Bituminous coal">Bituminous coal</a> is a dense sedimentary rock, usually black, but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material; it is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation, with substantial quantities used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a>.</li>
<li>"Steam coal" is a grade between bituminous coal and anthracite, once widely used as a fuel for <a href="/wiki/Steam_locomotive" title="Steam locomotive">steam locomotives</a>.

<p>The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However, the exact classification varies between countries. According to the German classification, coal is classified as follows:</p>

<p>The middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the English-language sub-bituminous to bituminous coal, while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite, but more inclusive (US anthracite has &lt; 6% volatiles).</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Outcrop" title="Outcrop">Outcrop</a> coal was used in <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> (3000–2000 BC), where it has been detected as forming part of the composition of <a href="/wiki/Funeral" title="Funeral">funeral</a> <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyres</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a>, with the exception of two modern fields, "the <a href="/wiki/Mining_in_Roman_Britain" title="Mining in Roman Britain">Romans</a> were exploiting coals in all the major coalfields in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> by the end of the second century AD". Evidence of trade in coal (dated to about AD 200) has been found at the <a href="/wiki/Heronbridge_Roman_Site" title="Heronbridge Roman Site">Roman settlement at Heronbridge</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Chester" title="Chester">Chester</a>, and in the <a href="/wiki/The_Fens" title="The Fens">Fenlands</a> of <a href="/wiki/East_Anglia" title="East Anglia">East Anglia</a>, where coal from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/English_Midlands" title="English Midlands">Midlands</a> was transported via the <a href="/wiki/Car_Dyke" title="Car Dyke">Car Dyke</a> for use in drying grain.

<p>No evidence exists of the product being of great importance in Britain before the <a href="/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a>, after about AD 1000. <a href="/wiki/Mineral" title="Mineral">Mineral</a> coal came to be referred to as "seacoal" in the 13th century; the wharf where the material arrived in London was known as Seacoal Lane, so identified in a charter of <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_England" title="Henry III of England">King Henry III</a> granted in 1253. Initially, the name was given because much coal was found on the shore, having fallen from the exposed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_seam" title="Coal seam">coal seams</a> on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops, but by the time of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to London by sea. In 1257–59, coal from <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> was shipped to London for the smiths and lime-burners building <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

<p>Coal is primarily used as a <a href="/wiki/Solid_fuel" title="Solid fuel">solid fuel</a> to produce electricity and heat through combustion. World coal consumption was about 7.25 billion <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> in 2010 (7.99 billion <a href="/wiki/Short_ton" title="Short ton">short tons</a>) and is expected to increase 48% to 9.05 billion tonnes (9.98 billion short tons) by 2030. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_power_in_China" title="Coal power in China">China</a> produced 3.47 billion tonnes (3.83 billion short tons) in 2011. <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> produced about 578 million tonnes (637.1 million short tons) in 2011. 68.7% of China's electricity comes from coal. The USA consumed about 13% of the world total in 2010, i.e. 951 million tonnes (1.05 billion short tons), using 93% of it for generation of electricity. 46% of total power generated in the USA was done using coal. The United States <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> estimates coal <a href="/wiki/Mineral_resource_classification" title="Mineral resource classification">reserves</a> at <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7011948000000000000♠</span>948<span style="margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em;">×</span>10</span> <a href="/wiki/Short_ton" title="Short ton">short tons</a> (860 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigatonne" title="Gigatonne">Gt</a>). One estimate for <a href="/wiki/Mineral_resource_classification" title="Mineral resource classification">resources</a> is 18,000 Gt.</p>
<p>When coal is used for <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>, it is usually pulverized and then combusted (burned) in a <a href="/wiki/Furnace" title="Furnace">furnace</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boiler</a>. The furnace heat converts boiler water to <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a>, which is then used to spin <a href="/wiki/Turbine" title="Turbine">turbines</a> which turn <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_generator" title="Electrical generator">generators</a> and create electricity. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermodynamic_efficiency" title="Thermodynamic efficiency">thermodynamic efficiency</a> of this process has been improved over time; some older coal-fired power stations have thermal efficiencies in the vicinity of 25% whereas the newest <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_steam_generator" title="Supercritical steam generator">supercritical</a> and "ultra-supercritical" steam cycle turbines, operating at temperatures over 600 °C and pressures over 27 MPa (over 3900 psi), can practically achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 45% (LHV basis) using anthracite fuel, or around 43% (LHV basis) even when using lower-grade lignite fuel. Further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved pre-drying (especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass) and cooling technologies.</p>
<p>An alternative approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the <a href="/wiki/Integrated_gasification_combined_cycle" title="Integrated gasification combined cycle">integrated gasification combined cycle</a> (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal can be first gasified (see <a href="/wiki/Coal_gasification" title="Coal gasification">coal gasification</a>) to create <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a>, which is burned in a <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">gas turbine</a> to produce electricity (just like natural gas is burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a <a href="/wiki/Heat_recovery_steam_generator" title="Heat recovery steam generator">heat recovery steam generator</a> which powers a supplemental <a href="/wiki/Steam_turbine" title="Steam turbine">steam turbine</a>. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ~42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB&amp;I). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.</p>
<p>At least 40% of the world's electricity comes from coal, and in 2012, about one-third of the United States' electricity came from coal, down from approximately 49% in 2008. As of 2012 in the United States, use of coal to generate electricity was declining, as plentiful supplies of natural gas obtained by <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing" title="Hydraulic fracturing">hydraulic fracturing</a> of tight shale formations became available at low prices.</p>
<p>In Denmark, a net electric efficiency of &gt; 47% has been obtained at the coal-fired Nordjyllandsværket CHP Plant and an overall plant efficiency of up to 91% with cogeneration of electricity and district heating. The multifuel-fired Avedøreværket CHP Plant just outside Copenhagen can achieve a net electric efficiency as high as 49%. The overall plant efficiency with cogeneration of electricity and district heating can reach as much as 94%.</p>
<p>An alternative form of coal combustion is as <a href="/wiki/Coal-water_slurry_fuel" title="Coal-water slurry fuel">coal-water slurry fuel</a> (CWS), which was developed in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. CWS significantly reduces emissions, improving the heating value of coal.

<p>The total known deposits recoverable by current technologies, including highly polluting, low-energy content types of coal (i.e., lignite, bituminous), is sufficient for many years. However, consumption is increasing and <a href="/wiki/Peak_coal" title="Peak coal">maximal production could be reached</a> within decades (see <a href="/wiki/Coal#World_coal_reserves" title="Coal">world coal reserves</a>, below).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coking_coal_and_use_of_coke">Coking coal and use of coke</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">Coke (fuel)</a></div>

<p>Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal (metallurgical coal), from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000 °C (1,832 °F), so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together. Metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a <a href="/wiki/Reducing_agent" title="Reducing agent">reducing agent</a> in smelting <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a> ore in a <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" title="Blast furnace">blast furnace</a>. The result is <a href="/wiki/Pig_iron" title="Pig iron">pig iron</a>, and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a>. The coking coal should be low in <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, so they do not migrate to the metal. Based on the ash percentage, the coking coal can be divided into various grades. These grades are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steel Grade I (Ash content not exceeding 15%)</li>
<li>Steel Grade II (Exceeding 15% but not exceeding 18%)</li>
<li>Washery Grade I (Exceeding 18% but not exceeding 21%)</li>
<li>Washery Grade II (Exceeding 21% but not exceeding 24%)</li>
<li>Washery Grade III (Exceeding 24% but not exceeding 28%)</li>
<li>Washery Grade IV (Exceeding 28% but not exceeding 35%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The coke must be <a href="/wiki/Coke_strength_after_reaction" title="Coke strength after reaction">strong enough</a> to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. However, the alternative route is <a href="/wiki/Direct_reduced_iron" title="Direct reduced iron">direct reduced iron</a>, where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including <a href="/wiki/Coal_tar" title="Coal tar">coal tar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, light oils, and <a href="/wiki/Coal_gas" title="Coal gas">coal gas</a>.</p>

Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is currently used by the <a href="/wiki/Sasol" title="Sasol">Sasol</a> chemical company of <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_economy" title="Hydrogen economy">hydrogen economy</a>, making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.</p>
<p>During gasification, the coal is mixed with <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a> while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">oxidize</a> the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas (H<sub>2</sub>). This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Town_gas" title="Town gas">town gas</a>.</p>

<p>If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_gas_shift_reaction" title="Water gas shift reaction">water gas shift reaction</a>, where more hydrogen is liberated.</p>

<p>In the past, coal was converted to make coal gas (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Town_gas" title="Town gas">town gas</a>), which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Coal_liquefaction" title="Coal liquefaction">Coal liquefaction</a></div>
<p>Coal can also be converted into <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_fuel" title="Synthetic fuel">synthetic fuels</a> equivalent to <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> or <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel</a> by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion). In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenated</a> or <a href="/wiki/Carbonization" title="Carbonization">carbonized</a>. Hydrogenation processes are the <a href="/wiki/Bergius_process" title="Bergius process">Bergius process</a>, the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature <a href="/wiki/Carbonization" title="Carbonization">carbonization</a>, coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750 °C (680 and 1,380 °F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.</p>
<p>Coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in the conversion process. If coal liquefaction is done without employing either <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS) technologies or biomass blending, the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a>. If CCS technologies are employed, reductions of 5–12% can be achieved in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_to_liquids" title="Coal to liquids">Coal to Liquid (CTL)</a> plants and up to a 75% reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass (30% biomass by weight) in coal/biomass-to-liquids plants. For future <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_fuel" title="Synthetic fuel">synthetic fuel</a> projects, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_sequestration" title="Carbon dioxide sequestration">carbon dioxide sequestration</a> is proposed to avoid releasing CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Sequestration adds to the cost of production.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Refined_coal">Refined coal</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Refined_coal" title="Refined coal">Refined coal</a></div>
<p>Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_processes">Industrial processes <span id="Industrial_processes"></span><span id="Sea_coal"></span></span></h3>
<p>Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foundry_sand" title="Foundry sand">foundry sand</a>. While the molten metal is in the <a href="/wiki/Molding_(process)" title="Molding (process)">mould</a>, the coal burns slowly, releasing <a href="/wiki/Reducing_agent" title="Reducing agent">reducing gases</a> at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting. Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the "bod") used for the bottom of a <a href="/wiki/Cupola_furnace" title="Cupola furnace">cupola furnace</a>. When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Production_of_chemicals">Production of chemicals</span></h3>

<p>Coal is an important feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is <a href="/wiki/Coal_gasification" title="Coal gasification">coal gasification</a> to produce <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a>. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include <a href="/wiki/Methanol" title="Methanol">methanol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Olefins" title="Olefins">olefins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Acetic_acid" title="Acetic acid">acetic acid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urea" title="Urea">urea</a> and others. The versatility of <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a> as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.</p>
<p>Historically, production of chemicals from coal has been used since the 1950s and has become established in the market. According to the 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database, a survey of current and planned gasifiers, from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37% to 45%. From 2008 to 2010, 22% of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production.</p>
<p>Because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China, India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there. In the United States, the best example of the industry is Eastman Chemical Company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site since 1983. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.</p>
<p>Coal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water. As of 2013 much of the coal to chemical production was in the People's Republic of China where environmental regulation and <a href="/wiki/Water_resource_management" title="Water resource management">water management</a> was weak.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h3>
<p>The use of coal as fuel causes adverse health impacts and deaths.</p>
<p>The deadly <a href="/wiki/Pea_soup_fog#London" title="Pea soup fog">London smog</a> was caused primarily by the heavy use of coal. In the United States coal-fired power plants were estimated in 2004 to cause nearly 24,000 premature deaths every year, including 2,800 from <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>. Annual health costs in Europe from use of coal to generate electricity are €42.8 billion, or $55 billion. Yet the disease and mortality burden of coal use today falls most heavily upon China.</p>
<p>Breathing in <a href="/wiki/Coal_dust" title="Coal dust">coal dust</a> causes <a href="/wiki/Coalworker%27s_pneumoconiosis" title="Coalworker's pneumoconiosis">coalworker's pneumoconiosis</a> which is known colloquially as "black lung", so-called because the coal dust literally turns the lungs black from their usual pink color. In the United States alone, it is estimated that 1500 former employees of the coal industry die every year from the effects of breathing in coal mine dust.</p>
<p>Around 10% of coal is ash, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_ash" title="Coal ash">Coal ash</a> is hazardous and toxic to human beings and other living things. Coal ash contains the radioactive elements <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>. Coal ash and other solid combustion byproducts are stored locally and escape in various ways that expose those living near coal plants to radiation and environmental toxics.</p>
<p>Huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually. In 2013, the US alone consumed on the order of 983 million short tonnes of coal per year. Use of coal on this scale generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year. These include <a href="/wiki/Fly_ash" title="Fly ash">fly ash</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bottom_ash" title="Bottom ash">bottom ash</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Flue-gas_desulfurization" title="Flue-gas desulfurization">flue-gas desulfurization</a> sludge, that contain <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metals" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a>, along with non-metals such as <a href="/wiki/Selenium" title="Selenium">selenium</a>.</p>

This report provides medical information regarding damage to the lungs, heart, and nervous system of Americans caused by the burning of coal as fuel. It details how the air pollution caused by the plume of coal smokestack emissions is a cause of asthma, strokes, reduced intelligence, artery blockages, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, mercury poisoning, arterial occlusion, and lung cancer.</p>
<p>More recently, the Chicago School of Public Health released a largely similar report, echoing many of the same findings.</p>
<p>Though coal burning has increasingly been supplanted by less-toxic natural gas use in recent years, a 2010 study by the Clean Air Task Force still estimated that "air pollution from coal-fired power plants accounts for more than 13,000 premature deaths, 20,000 heart attacks, and 1.6 million lost workdays in the U.S. each year." The total monetary cost of these health impacts is over $100 billion annually.</p>
<p>The WHO classifies coal as a "dirty fuel" and encourages the movement away from such fuels towards cleaner alternatives.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">Coal mining</a> and coal fueling of <a href="/wiki/Power_station" title="Power station">power station</a> and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage.</p>
<p>Water systems are affected by coal mining. For example, mining affects <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> and <a href="/wiki/Water_table" title="Water table">water table</a> levels and acidity. Spills of fly ash, such as the <a href="/wiki/Kingston_Fossil_Plant_coal_fly_ash_slurry_spill" title="Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill">Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill</a>, can also contaminate land and waterways, and destroy homes. Power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water. This can affect the flows of rivers, and has consequential impacts on other land uses.</p>
<p>One of the earliest known impacts of coal on the water cycle was <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>. Approximately 75 Tg/S per year of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks, whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Release of SO<sub>2</sub> also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems.</p>
<p>Disused coal mines can also cause issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to infrastructure or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, and it has been estimated that thousands of <a href="/wiki/Coal_seam_fire" title="Coal seam fire">coal seam fires</a> are burning at any given time. For example, there is a <a href="/wiki/Coal_seam_fire#Germany" title="Coal seam fire">coal seam fire in Germany</a> that has been burning since 1668, and is still burning in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Some environmental impacts are modest, such as dust nuisance. However, perhaps the largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide, a <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> that causes <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> and <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, according to the <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">IPCC</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</a>. Coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The production of coke from coal produces <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, coal tar, and gaseous compounds as by-products which if discharged to land, air or waterways can act as environmental pollutants. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Whyalla_steelworks" title="Whyalla steelworks">Whyalla steelworks</a> is one example of a coke producing facility where liquid ammonia is discharged to the marine environment.</p>
<p>In 1999, world gross <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_emissions" title="Carbon dioxide emissions">carbon dioxide emissions</a> from coal usage were 8,666 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. In 2011, world gross emissions from coal usage were 14,416 million tonnes. For every megawatt-hour generated, coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide, which is almost double the approximately 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide released by a <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>-fired electric plant. Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the market in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions may have fallen. Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992. In 2013, the head of the UN climate agency advised that most of the world's coal reserves should be left in the ground to avoid catastrophic global warming.</p>

<p>"Clean" coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation. Those technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing <a href="/wiki/Mineral" title="Mineral">minerals</a> and impurities from the coal, <a href="/wiki/Gasification" title="Gasification">gasification</a> (see also <a href="/wiki/Integrated_gasification_combined_cycle" title="Integrated gasification combined cycle">IGCC</a>), improved technology for treating <a href="/wiki/Flue" title="Flue">flue</a> gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the <a href="/wiki/Flue_gas" title="Flue gas">flue gas</a> and dewatering lower rank coals (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brown_coal" title="Brown coal">brown coals</a>) to improve the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calorific_value" title="Calorific value">calorific value</a>, and thus the efficiency of the conversion into <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. Figures from the United States Environmental Protection Agency show that these technologies have made today's coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced.</p>
<p>Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>, the most important gases in causation of <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health. More recent focus has been on carbon dioxide (due to its impact on <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>) and concern over toxic species such as mercury. Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery, potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage, and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.</p>

<p>Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-combustion capture – This involves <a href="/wiki/Gasification" title="Gasification">gasification</a> of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, which may be <a href="/wiki/Water-gas_shift_reaction" title="Water-gas shift reaction">shifted</a> to produce a H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>-rich gas mixture, from which the CO<sub>2</sub> can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered, This technology is usually associated with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integrated_Gasification_Combined_Cycle" title="Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle">Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle</a> process configurations.</li>
<li>Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO<sub>2</sub> from exhaust gases of combustion processes, typically using sorbents, solvents, or membrane separations to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the bulk gases.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxy-fuel_combustion" title="Oxy-fuel combustion">Oxy-fuel combustion</a> – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO<sub>2</sub> capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kemper_Project" title="Kemper Project">Kemper County IGCC Project</a>, a 582 MW <a href="/wiki/Coal_gasification" title="Coal gasification">coal gasification</a>-based power plant, will use pre-combustion capture of CO<sub>2</sub> to capture 65% of the CO<sub>2</sub> the plant produces, which will be utilized/geologically sequestered in <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a> operations.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO<sub>2</sub> will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.</p>
<p>An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company <a href="/wiki/Vattenfall" title="Vattenfall">Vattenfall</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Schwarze_Pumpe_power_station" title="Schwarze Pumpe power station">Schwarze Pumpe power station</a> located in <a href="/wiki/Spremberg" title="Spremberg">Spremberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, built by German firm <a href="/wiki/Siemens" title="Siemens">Siemens</a>, which went on-line in September 2008. The facility captures CO<sub>2</sub> and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO<sub>2</sub> into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO<sub>2</sub> into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_aspects">Economic aspects</span></h2>
<p>Coal (by liquefaction technology) is one of the <a href="/wiki/Backstop_resources" title="Backstop resources">backstop resources</a> that could limit escalation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_prices" title="Oil prices">oil prices</a> and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel, with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_sand" title="Oil sand">oil sand</a> projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.</p>
<p>In China, due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.</p>
<p>China is the largest producer of coal in the world. It is the world's largest energy consumer, and relies on coal to supply 69% of its energy needs. An estimated 5 million people worked in China's coal-mining industry in 2007.</p>
<p>Coal pollution costs the EU €43 billion each year. Measures to cut air pollution may have beneficial long-term economic impacts for individuals.</p>

<p>The US Energy Information Agency's 1999 report on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for energy generation quotes an emission factor of 0.963 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh for coal power, compared to 0.881 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh (oil), or 0.569 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh (natural gas).</p>

<p>Thousands of coal fires are burning around the world. Those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface <a href="/wiki/Wildfire" title="Wildfire">wildfires</a>. Coal seams can be set on fire by <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_combustion" title="Spontaneous combustion">spontaneous combustion</a> or contact with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mine_fire" title="Mine fire">mine fire</a> or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO<sub>2</sub> from <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>.

Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian <a href="/wiki/Burning_Mountain" title="Burning Mountain">Burning Mountain</a> was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.</p>

Clinker is rock that has been fused by the natural burning of coal. In the Powder River Basin approximately 27 to 54 billion tons of coal burned within the past three million years.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production_trends">Production trends</span></h2>



<p>In 2006, China was the top producer of coal with 38% share followed by the United States and India, according to the <a href="/wiki/British_Geological_Survey" title="British Geological Survey">British Geological Survey</a>. As of 2012 coal production in the United States was falling at the rate of 7% annually with many power plants using coal shut down or converted to natural gas; however, some of the reduced domestic demand was taken up by increased exports with five <a href="/wiki/Coal_pier" title="Coal pier">coal export terminals</a> being proposed in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> to export coal from the <a href="/wiki/Powder_River_Basin" title="Powder River Basin">Powder River Basin</a> to China and other Asian markets; however, as of 2013, environmental opposition was increasing. High-sulfur coal mined in Illinois which was unsaleable in the United States found a ready market in Asia as exports reached 13 million tons in 2012.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="World_coal_reserves">World coal reserves</span></h3>
<p>The 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the Energy Information Administration are equal to about 4,196 BBOE (billion <a href="/wiki/Barrel_of_oil_equivalent" title="Barrel of oil equivalent">barrels of oil equivalent</a>). The amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons, or 133.179 quadrillion BTU's. This is an average of 18.8 million BTU per short ton. In terms of heat content, this is about 57,000,000 barrels (9,100,000 m) of oil equivalent per day. By comparison in 2007, natural gas provided 51,000,000 barrels (8,100,000 m) of oil equivalent per day, while oil provided 85,800,000 barrels (13,640,000 m) per day.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/BP" title="BP">British Petroleum</a>, in its 2007 report, estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years <a href="/wiki/Reserves-to-production_ratio" title="Reserves-to-production ratio">reserves-to-production ratio</a> based on <i>proven</i> coal reserves worldwide. This figure only includes reserves classified as "proven"; exploration drilling programs by mining companies, particularly in under-explored areas, are continually providing new reserves. In many cases, companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as "proven". However, some nations haven't updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals.</p>
<p>Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed reserves; coal is mined in over 100 countries, and on all continents except <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The largest reserves are found in the United States, Russia, China, Australia and India. Note the table below.</p>
