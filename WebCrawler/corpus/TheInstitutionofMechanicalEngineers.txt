<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>

<p>The Institution of Mechanical Engineers was founded on 27 January 1847, in the Queen's Hotel next to <a href="/wiki/Curzon_Street_railway_station" title="Curzon Street railway station">Curzon Street railway station</a> in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> by the railway pioneer <a href="/wiki/George_Stephenson" title="George Stephenson">George Stephenson</a> and others. The founding of the Institution is said to have been spurred by outrage that <a href="/wiki/George_Stephenson" title="George Stephenson">George Stephenson</a>, the most famous mechanical engineer of the age, had been refused admission to the <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Civil_Engineers" title="Institution of Civil Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a> unless he sent in "a probationary essay as proof of his capacity as an engineer". However this account has been challenged as an exaggeration: though there was certainly coolness between Stephenson and the Institution of Civil Engineers, it is more likely that the motivation behind the founding of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was simply the need for a specific home for the growing number of mechanical engineers employed in the burgeoning railway and manufacturing industries.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Charles_Beyer" title="Charles Beyer">Charles Beyer</a> proposed that George Stephenson become the Institution's first President in 1847, followed by his son, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Stephenson" title="Robert Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>, in 1849. Beyer became Vice President and was one of the first to present papers to the Institution; <a href="/wiki/Charles_Geach" title="Charles Geach">Charles Geach</a> was the IMechE's first treasurer. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries some of Britain's most notable engineers held the position of President, including <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth" title="Joseph Whitworth">Joseph Whitworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Siemens" title="Carl Wilhelm Siemens">Carl Wilhelm Siemens</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_Harry_Ricardo" title="Sir Harry Ricardo">Sir Harry Ricardo</a>. It operated from premises in Birmingham until 1877 when it moved to London, taking up its present headquarters on Birdcage Walk in 1899.</p>

<p>Upon its move to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> in 1877, the Institution rented premises at No 10 Victoria Chambers, where it remained for 20 years. In 1895 the Institution bought a plot of land at Storey's Gate, on the eastern end of <a href="/wiki/Birdcage_Walk" title="Birdcage Walk">Birdcage Walk</a>, for £9,500. Architect Basil Slade looked to the newly completed Admiralty buildings facing the site for inspiration. The building was designed in the <a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture" title="Queen Anne style architecture">Queen Anne, 'streaky bacon', style</a> in red brick and <a href="/wiki/Portland_stone" title="Portland stone">Portland stone</a>. Inside, there were several features that were state of the art for the time, including a <a href="/wiki/Telephone" title="Telephone">telephone</a>, a 54-inch fan in the lecture theatre for driving air into the building; an <a href="/wiki/Elevator" title="Elevator">electric lift</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Otis_Elevator_Company" title="Otis Elevator Company">Otis Elevator Company</a>, and a Synchronome master-clock, which controlled all house timepieces. In 1933 architect <a href="/wiki/James_Miller_(architect)" title="James Miller (architect)">James Miller</a>, who also designed the neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Civil_Engineers" title="Institution of Civil Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a>, remodelled the building, expanding the library and introducing electric lighting.</p>
<p>The building would go on to host the first public presentation of <a href="/wiki/Frank_Whittle" title="Frank Whittle">Frank Whittle's</a> <a href="/wiki/Jet_engine" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> in 1945. In 1943 it became the venue for the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Electrical_and_Mechanical_Engineers" title="Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers">Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' (REME)</a> planning of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Overlord" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Normandy" title="Invasion of Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>.</p>
<p>Today <a class="external text" href="http://www.onebirdcagewalk.com/home" rel="nofollow">One Birdcage Walk</a> hosts events, lectures, seminars and meetings in 17 conference and meeting rooms named after notable former members of the Institution, such as <a href="/wiki/Frank_Whittle" title="Frank Whittle">Frank Whittle</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Stephenson" title="George Stephenson">George Stephenson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Algernon_Parsons" title="Charles Algernon Parsons">Charles Parsons</a>.</p>

<p>Biomedical Engineering Association (BmEA) aims to bring together key workers from both medicine and engineering to discuss the latest advances and issues, to enable networking among different industry leaders, and to promote the field of Medical Engineering, also known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioengineering" title="Bioengineering">Bioengineering</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biomedical_Engineering" title="Biomedical Engineering">Biomedical Engineering</a>, to government, healthcare professionals and the wider public. This committee offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>seminars, lectures and conferences every year;</li>
<li>the <i>Journal of Engineering in Medicine</i>;</li>
<li>the annual Student Project Competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Railway Division</b> was formed in 1969 when IMechE amalgamated with the Institution of Locomotive Engineers.</p>
