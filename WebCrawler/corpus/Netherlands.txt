The <a href="/wiki/Port_of_Rotterdam" title="Port of Rotterdam">port of Rotterdam</a> is the largest port in Europe – as large as the next three largest combined – and was the world's largest port between 1962 and 2004. The name <i><a href="/wiki/Holland" title="Holland">Holland</a></i> is also frequently and incorrectly used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>"Netherlands" literally means "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lower_Countries" title="Lower Countries">lower countries</a>", influenced by its low land and flat geography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">above sea level</a>.

Since the late 16th century, large areas (<a href="/wiki/Polder" title="Polder">polders</a>) have been <a href="/wiki/Land_reclamation" title="Land reclamation">reclaimed</a> from the sea and lakes, amounting to nearly 17% of the country's current land mass. With a <a href="/wiki/Population_density" title="Population density">population density</a> of 408 people per km – 505 (July 2016) if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density" title="List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density">very densely populated country</a>.

Nevertheless, the Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products, after the United States. This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate. The Netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected <a href="/wiki/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliament</a>, and since 1848 it has been governed as a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary</a> <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, organised as a <a href="/wiki/Unitary_state" title="Unitary state">unitary state</a>.

<p>The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation "<a href="/wiki/Holland" title="Holland">Holland</a>" (meaning <i>holt land</i>, or wood land), though this refers only to <a href="/wiki/North_Holland" title="North Holland">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Holland" title="South Holland">South Holland</a>, two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province and earlier the <a href="/wiki/County_of_Holland" title="County of Holland">County of Holland</a>. This originally <a href="/wiki/Franks" title="Franks">Frankish</a> county emerged from the dissolved <a href="/wiki/Frisian_Kingdom" title="Frisian Kingdom">Frisian Kingdom</a> and was, after the decline of <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant" title="Duchy of Brabant">Brabant</a>, economically and politically the most important county in the region. Because of this importance and the emphasis on Holland during the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars" title="Anglo-Dutch Wars">Anglo-Dutch Wars</a> in the 17th and 18th century, Holland served as a <i><a href="/wiki/Pars_pro_toto" title="Pars pro toto">pars pro toto</a></i> for the entire country in English, and is considered either incorrect, informal, or on occasion opprobrious, depending on the context, but is more acceptable when referring to the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team" title="Netherlands national football team">national football team</a>.</p>
<p>Place names with <i>Neder</i> (or <i>lage</i>), <i>Nieder</i>, <i>Nether</i> (or <i>low</i>) and <i>Nedre</i> are in use in various places in countries where a Germanic language is spoken, and has in French and Latin its respective counterparts in <i>Bas</i> or <i>Inferior</i>. They are sometimes used in relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as <i>Upper</i>, <i>Boven</i>, <i>Oben</i>, <i>Superior</i> or <i>Haut</i>. In the case of the Low Countries the geographical location of the <i>lower</i> region has been more or less downstream and near the sea, the geographical location of the upper region changed over time tremendously. The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream <a href="/wiki/Germania_Inferior" title="Germania Inferior">Germania Inferior</a> (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream <a href="/wiki/Germania_Superior" title="Germania Superior">Germania Superior</a> (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of <a href="/wiki/Lower_Lorraine" title="Lower Lorraine">Lower Lorraine</a>, that covered much of the Low Countries. But this time the corresponding <i>Upper</i> region is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Upper_Lorraine" title="Upper Lorraine">Upper Lorraine</a>, in nowadays Northern France. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dukes_of_Burgundy" title="Dukes of Burgundy">Dukes of Burgundy</a>, who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term <i>les pays de par deçà</i> (~ the lands over here) for the Low Countries as opposed to <i>les pays de par delà</i> (~ the lands over there) for their original homeland: <a href="/wiki/Burgundy" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a> in present-day east-central France.</p>
<p>Under <a href="/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands" title="Habsburg Netherlands">Habsburg rule</a>, <i>Les pays de par deçà</i> developed in <i>pays d'embas</i> (lands down-here), a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions in Europe. This was translated as <i>Neder-landen</i> in contemporary Dutch official documents. However, <i>Niderlant</i> was also the region between the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meuse_(river)" title="Meuse (river)">Meuse</a> and the lower <a href="/wiki/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> in the late Middle Ages. The area known as <i>Oberland</i> (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located <a href="/wiki/Cologne" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>.</p>
<p>From the mid-sixteenth century on, the <i>Low Countries</i> or the "Netherlands" was – besides <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> – probably the most commonly used name. The <a href="/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War" title="Eighty Years' War">Eighty Years' War</a> (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Republic" title="Dutch Republic">United Provinces</a> (<i>Belgica Foederata</i> in <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>, the "Federated Netherlands") and the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Netherlands" title="Southern Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a> (<i>Belgica Regia</i>, "Royal Netherlands"). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries the Netherlands, <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term <a href="/wiki/Benelux" title="Benelux">Benelux</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prehistory_.28before_500_BC.29">Prehistory (before 500 BC)</span></h3>



<p>The prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography. The oldest human (<a href="/wiki/Neanderthal" title="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a>) traces in the Netherlands were found in higher soils, near <a href="/wiki/Maastricht" title="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>, from 250,000 years ago. After the end of the Ice Age, various <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> groups inhabited the area, and around 8000 BC <a href="/wiki/Mesolithic" title="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> tribes resided in Friesland and Drenthe, where the <a href="/wiki/Pesse_canoe" title="Pesse canoe">oldest canoe</a> in the world was recovered. Autochthonous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherers" title="Hunter-gatherers">hunter-gatherers</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Swifterbant_culture" title="Swifterbant culture">Swifterbant culture</a> are attested from around 5600 BC onwards. They are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern Scandinavian <a href="/wiki/Erteb%C3%B8lle_culture" title="Ertebølle culture">Ertebølle culture</a> (5300–4000 BC). To the west, the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game. People made the switch to <a href="/wiki/Animal_husbandry" title="Animal husbandry">animal husbandry</a> sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC. Agricultural transformation took place very gradually, between 4300 BC and 4000 BC. The farming <a href="/wiki/Funnelbeaker_culture" title="Funnelbeaker culture">Funnelbeaker culture</a> extended from Denmark through northern Germany into the northern Netherlands, and erected the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dolmens" title="Dolmens">dolmens</a>, large stone grave monuments found in <a href="/wiki/Drenthe" title="Drenthe">Drenthe</a> (built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC). To the southwest, the <a href="/wiki/Vlaardingen_culture" title="Vlaardingen culture">Vlaardingen culture</a> (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period. Around 2950 BC there was a quick and smooth transition from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Funnelbeaker" title="Funnelbeaker">Funnelbeaker</a> farming culture to the pan-European <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corded_Ware" title="Corded Ware">Corded Ware</a> pastoralist culture. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bell_Beaker_culture" title="Bell Beaker culture">Bell Beaker culture</a>, also present in the Netherlands, apparently rose out of the Corded Ware culture.</p>
<p>Discoveries of copper artifacts imply trade with other parts of Europe, as the metal is not normally found in Dutch soil. The <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The many finds in <a href="/wiki/Drenthe" title="Drenthe">Drenthe</a> of rare and valuable objects, suggest that it was a trading centre in the Bronze Age. The <a href="/wiki/Beaker_culture" title="Beaker culture">Bell Beaker cultures</a> (2700–2100 BC) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BC). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Bronze_Age" title="Atlantic Bronze Age">Atlantic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nordic_Bronze_Age" title="Nordic Bronze Age">Nordic</a> horizons, roughly divided by the course of the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>. In the north, the <a href="/wiki/Elp_culture" title="Elp culture">Elp culture</a> (c. 1800 BC to 800 BC) was a <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> archaeological culture having <a href="/wiki/Earthenware" title="Earthenware">earthenware</a> pottery of low quality as a marker. The initial phase was characterised by <a href="/wiki/Tumulus" title="Tumulus">tumuli</a> (1800–1200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the <a href="/wiki/Tumulus_culture" title="Tumulus culture">Tumulus culture</a> (1600–1200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urnfield" title="Urnfield">Urnfield</a> (<a href="/wiki/Cremation" title="Cremation">cremation</a>) burial customs (1200–800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the <a href="/wiki/Hilversum_culture" title="Hilversum culture">Hilversum culture</a> (1800–800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> brought a measure of prosperity. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including <a href="/wiki/Bog_iron" title="Bog iron">bog iron</a> extracted from the <a href="/wiki/Ore" title="Ore">ore</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peat_bogs" title="Peat bogs">peat bogs</a> in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the <a href="/wiki/Veluwe" title="Veluwe">Veluwe</a> and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. <a href="/wiki/Blacksmith" title="Blacksmith">Smiths</a> travelled from small settlement to settlement with <a href="/wiki/Bronze" title="Bronze">bronze</a> and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including <a href="/wiki/Axe" title="Axe">axes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Knife" title="Knife">knives</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pins" title="Pins">pins</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arrowheads" title="Arrowheads">arrowheads</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sword" title="Sword">swords</a>. Some evidence even suggests the making of <a href="/wiki/Damascus_steel" title="Damascus steel">Damascus steel</a> <a href="/wiki/Sword" title="Sword">swords</a> using an advanced method of <a href="/wiki/Forging" title="Forging">forging</a> that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel. The <a href="/wiki/Vorstengraf_(Oss)" title="Vorstengraf (Oss)">King's grave of Oss</a> dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.</p>

<p>The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC, that further deteriorated around 650 BC, might have triggered migration of <a href="/wiki/Germanic_peoples" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic</a> tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/North_Sea_Germanic" title="North Sea Germanic">North Sea Germanic</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ingvaeones" title="Ingvaeones">Ingvaeones</a> inhabited the northern part of the <a href="/wiki/Low_Countries" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>. They would later develop into the <a href="/wiki/Frisii" title="Frisii">Frisii</a> and the early <a href="/wiki/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>. A second grouping, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weser-Rhine_Germanic" title="Weser-Rhine Germanic">Weser-Rhine Germanic</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Istvaeones" title="Istvaeones">Istvaeones</a>), extended along the middle Rhine and <a href="/wiki/Weser" title="Weser">Weser</a> and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the <a href="/wiki/Salian_Franks" title="Salian Franks">Salian Franks</a>. Also the <a href="/wiki/Celts" title="Celts">Celtic</a> <a href="/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture" title="La Tène culture">La Tène culture</a> (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest) had expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the <a href="/wiki/Low_Countries" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Iron Age <a href="/wiki/Nordwestblock" title="Nordwestblock">Nordwestblock</a> culture, that eventually was being absorbed by the <a href="/wiki/Celts" title="Celts">Celts</a> to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Gallic_Wars" title="Gallic Wars">Gallic Wars</a>, the area south of the <a href="/wiki/Oude_Rijn_(Utrecht_and_South_Holland)" title="Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)">Oude Rijn</a> and west of the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> was conquered by <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman forces</a> under <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> from 57 BC to 53 BC. Caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands: the <a href="/wiki/Menapii" title="Menapii">Menapii</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Eburones" title="Eburones">Eburones</a>. The Rhine became fixed as Rome's northern frontier around 12 AD. Notable towns would arise along the <a href="/wiki/Limes_Germanicus" title="Limes Germanicus">Limes Germanicus</a>: <a href="/wiki/Nijmegen" title="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Voorburg" title="Voorburg">Voorburg</a>. At first part of <a href="/wiki/Gallia_Belgica" title="Gallia Belgica">Gallia Belgica</a>, the area south of the Limes became part of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_province" title="Roman province">Roman province</a> of <a href="/wiki/Germania_Inferior" title="Germania Inferior">Germania Inferior</a>. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule (but not its presence and control), while the border tribes <a href="/wiki/Batavi_(Germanic_tribe)" title="Batavi (Germanic tribe)">Batavi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cananefates" title="Cananefates">Cananefates</a> served in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ala_(Roman_military)" title="Ala (Roman military)">Roman cavalry</a>. The Batavi rose against the Romans in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Batavian_rebellion" title="Batavian rebellion">Batavian rebellion</a> of 69AD, but were eventually defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the <a href="/wiki/Salian_Franks" title="Salian Franks">Salian Franks</a>, whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century. Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. The Salian Franks were forced by the confederation of the <a href="/wiki/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a> from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in West Flanders and the Southwest Netherlands, they were raiding the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>. Roman forces pacified the region, but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Julian_the_Apostate" title="Julian the Apostate">Julian the Apostate</a> (358), when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as <i><a href="/wiki/Foederati" title="Foederati">foederati</a></i> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxandria" title="Toxandria">Toxandria</a>. After deteriorating climate conditions and the Romans withdrawal, the <a href="/wiki/Frisii" title="Frisii">Frisii</a> disappeared from the northern Netherlands, probably forced to resettle within Roman territory as <i><a href="/wiki/Laeti" title="Laeti">laeti</a></i> in c. 296.

<p>After <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> government in the area collapsed, the Franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, <a href="/wiki/Clovis_I" title="Clovis I">Clovis I</a> had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frankish_kingdom" title="Frankish kingdom">Frankish kingdom</a>, and from there continued his conquests into <a href="/wiki/Gaul" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the <a href="/wiki/Vulgar_Latin" title="Vulgar Latin">Vulgar Latin</a> of the local population. A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Old_Frankish" title="Old Frankish">Old Frankish</a>, which by the ninth century had evolved into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Old_Low_Franconian" title="Old Low Franconian">Old Low Franconian</a> or <a href="/wiki/Old_Dutch" title="Old Dutch">Old Dutch</a>. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence.</p>

<p>To the north of the Franks, climatic conditions on the coast improved, and during the <a href="/wiki/Migration_Period" title="Migration Period">Migration Period</a> the abandoned land was resettled again, mostly by <a href="/wiki/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>, but also by the closely related <a href="/wiki/Angles" title="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jutes" title="Jutes">Jutes</a> and ancient <a href="/wiki/Frisii" title="Frisii">Frisii</a>. Many moved on to <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and came to be known as <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>, but those who stayed would be referred to as <a href="/wiki/Frisians" title="Frisians">Frisians</a> and their language as <a href="/wiki/Frisian_languages" title="Frisian languages">Frisian</a>, named after the land that was once inhabited by Frisii. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast, and it is still the language most closely related to English among the living languages of continental Europe. By the seventh century a <a href="/wiki/Frisian_Kingdom" title="Frisian Kingdom">Frisian Kingdom</a> (650–734) under King <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aldegisel" title="Aldegisel">Aldegisel</a> and King <a href="/wiki/Redbad,_King_of_the_Frisians" title="Redbad, King of the Frisians">Redbad</a> emerged with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utrecht_(city)" title="Utrecht (city)">Utrecht</a> as its centre of power, while <a href="/wiki/Dorestad" title="Dorestad">Dorestad</a> was a flourishing trading place. Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Boarn" title="Battle of the Boarn">Battle of the Boarn</a>, the Frisians were defeated after a <a href="/wiki/Frisian%E2%80%93Frankish_wars" title="Frisian–Frankish wars">series of wars</a>. With the approval of the Franks, the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_mission" title="Anglo-Saxon mission">Anglo-Saxon</a> missionary <a href="/wiki/Willibrord" title="Willibrord">Willibrord</a> converted the Frisian people to <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. He established the <a href="/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Utrecht_(695%E2%80%931580)" title="Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)">Archdiocese of Utrecht</a> and became bishop of the Frisians. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in <a href="/wiki/Dokkum" title="Dokkum">Dokkum</a>, in 754.</p>


<p>The Frankish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carolingian_empire" title="Carolingian empire">Carolingian empire</a> modeled itself after the Roman Empire and controlled much of Western Europe. However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts—<a href="/wiki/East_Francia" title="East Francia">East</a>, <a href="/wiki/Middle_Francia" title="Middle Francia">Middle</a>, and <a href="/wiki/West_Francia" title="West Francia">West Francia</a>. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of <a href="/wiki/Middle_Francia" title="Middle Francia">Middle Francia</a>, which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprises territories from <a href="/wiki/Frisia" title="Frisia">Frisia</a> in the north to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_(medieval)" title="Kingdom of Italy (medieval)">Kingdom of Italy</a> in the south. When the middle kingdom was partitioned, the lands north of the <a href="/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a> passed to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lothair_II_of_Lotharingia" title="Lothair II of Lotharingia">Lothair II</a> and consecutively were named <a href="/wiki/Lotharingia" title="Lotharingia">Lotharingia</a>. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Upper_Lotharingia" title="Upper Lotharingia">Upper</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lower_Lotharingia" title="Lower Lotharingia">Lower Lotharingia</a>, the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of <a href="/wiki/East_Francia" title="East Francia">East Francia</a> in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless <a href="/wiki/Frisians" title="Frisians">Frisian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franks" title="Franks">Frankish</a> towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 850, <a href="/wiki/Lothair_I" title="Lothair I">Lothair I</a> acknowledged the Viking <a href="/wiki/Rorik_of_Dorestad" title="Rorik of Dorestad">Rorik of Dorestad</a> as ruler of most of Frisia. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, <a href="/wiki/Godfrid,_Duke_of_Frisia" title="Godfrid, Duke of Frisia">Godfrid, Duke of Frisia</a>. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that lay the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was <a href="/wiki/Gerolf_of_Holland" title="Gerolf of Holland">Gerolf of Holland</a>, who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> (the successor state of East Francia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms, that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. <a href="/wiki/County_of_Holland" title="County of Holland">Holland</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_of_Hainaut" title="County of Hainaut">Hainaut</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_of_Flanders" title="County of Flanders">Flanders</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Gelre" title="Duchy of Gelre">Gelre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant" title="Duchy of Brabant">Brabant</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bishopric_of_Utrecht" title="Bishopric of Utrecht">Utrecht</a> were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally <a href="/wiki/Frisia" title="Frisia">Frisian</a>. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Old_Low_Franconian" title="Old Low Franconian">Old Low Franconian</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Old_Dutch" title="Old Dutch">Old Dutch</a>). The rest of <a href="/wiki/Frisia" title="Frisia">Frisia</a> in the north (now <a href="/wiki/Friesland" title="Friesland">Friesland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Groningen_(province)" title="Groningen (province)">Groningen</a>) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the "<a href="/wiki/Frisian_freedom" title="Frisian freedom">Frisian freedom</a>") and resented the imposition of the feudal system.</p>
<p>Around 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monasteries" title="Monasteries">monasteries</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Castles" title="Castles">castles</a>, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain <a href="/wiki/City_rights_in_the_Low_Countries" title="City rights in the Low Countries">privileges</a> for themselves from the <a href="/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch">sovereign</a>. In practice, this meant that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brugge" title="Brugge">Brugge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.</p>
<p>Around 1100 AD, farmers from <a href="/wiki/County_of_Flanders" title="County of Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bishopric_of_Utrecht" title="Bishopric of Utrecht">Utrecht</a> began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, and made the emergence of the County of Holland as center of power possible. The title of <a href="/wiki/Count_of_Holland" title="Count of Holland">Count of Holland</a> were fought over in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hook_and_Cod_Wars" title="Hook and Cod Wars">Hook and Cod Wars</a> (<a href="/wiki/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>: <span lang="nl"><i>Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten</i></span>) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke <a href="/wiki/Philip_the_Good" title="Philip the Good">Philip the Good</a> of Burgundy – who was also Count of Flanders – to conquer Holland.</p>

<p>Most of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Imperial</a> and <a href="/wiki/France_in_the_Middle_Ages" title="France in the Middle Ages">French</a> fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a <a href="/wiki/Personal_union" title="Personal union">personal union</a> by Philip the Good, duke of <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Burgundy" title="Duchy of Burgundy">Burgundy</a> in 1433. The <a href="/wiki/House_of_Valois-Burgundy" title="House of Valois-Burgundy">House of Valois-Burgundy</a> and their <a href="/wiki/House_of_Habsburg" title="House of Habsburg">Habsburg</a> heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the <a href="/wiki/County_of_Holland" title="County of Holland">County of Holland</a> defeated the fleets of the <a href="/wiki/Hanseatic_League" title="Hanseatic League">Hanseatic League</a> several times. <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_region" title="Baltic region">Baltic region</a>. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> of the former <a href="/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetlands</a> to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.</p>

<p>Under Habsburg <a href="/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a>, ruler of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and King of <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Spain</a>, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the <a href="/wiki/Seventeen_Provinces" title="Seventeen Provinces">Seventeen Provinces</a>, which also included most of present-day <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the <a href="/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War" title="Eighty Years' War">Eighty Years' War</a> between the Provinces and their <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish</a> ruler began. In 1579, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Utrecht" title="Union of Utrecht">Union of Utrecht</a> in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Abjuration" title="Act of Abjuration">Act of Abjuration</a>, the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> as reigning monarch in the northern provinces.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a> sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish, and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid the Dutch in their war with the Catholic Spanish. The English army under command of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Dudley,_1st_Earl_of_Leicester" title="Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester">Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester</a> was of no real benefit to the Dutch rebellion. Philip II, the son of Charles V, was not prepared to let them go easily, and war continued until 1648, when Spain under King <a href="/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain" title="Philip IV of Spain">Philip IV</a> finally recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_M%C3%BCnster" title="Peace of Münster">Peace of Münster</a>.

The sparsely populated region of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lordship_of_Drenthe" title="Lordship of Drenthe">Drenthe</a> was part of the republic too, although it was not considered one of the provinces. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the <a href="/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War" title="Eighty Years' War">Eighty Years' War</a> a number of so-called <a href="/wiki/Generality_Lands" title="Generality Lands">Generality Lands</a> in <a href="/wiki/County_of_Flanders" title="County of Flanders">Flanders</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant" title="Duchy of Brabant">Brabant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Limburg" title="Duchy of Limburg">Limburg</a>. Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own, and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled <a href="/wiki/Southern_Netherlands" title="Southern Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a>.</p>


<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age" title="Dutch Golden Age">Dutch Golden Age</a>, spanning much of the 17th century, the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Empire" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch Empire</a> grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers. Science, military, and art (especially <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age_painting" title="Dutch Golden Age painting">painting</a>) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships. The <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company" title="Dutch East India Company">Dutch East India Company</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_West_India_Company" title="Dutch West India Company">Dutch West India Company</a> established <a href="/wiki/Colonization" title="Colonization">colonies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trading_post" title="Trading post">trading posts</a> all over the world, including ruling the northern parts of <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taiwan_under_Dutch_rule" title="Taiwan under Dutch rule">1624–1662 and 1664–1667</a>. The <a href="/wiki/New_Netherland" title="New Netherland">Dutch settlement in North America</a> began with the founding of <a href="/wiki/New_Amsterdam" title="New Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> on the southern part of <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the <a href="/wiki/Cape_Colony" title="Cape Colony">Cape Colony</a> in 1652. <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonisation_of_the_Guianas" title="Dutch colonisation of the Guianas">Dutch colonies in South America</a> were established along the many rivers in the fertile <a href="/wiki/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a> plains, among them <a href="/wiki/Surinam_(Dutch_colony)" title="Surinam (Dutch colony)">Colony of Surinam</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Suriname" title="Suriname">Suriname</a>).

<p>Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> country in the world. In early modern Europe it had the wealthiest trading city (<a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>) and the first full-time <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam_Stock_Exchange" title="Amsterdam Stock Exchange">stock exchange</a>.

However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig" title="Battle of Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/William_I_of_the_Netherlands" title="William I of the Netherlands">William Frederick</a>, son of the last stadtholder, returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_Principality_of_the_United_Netherlands" title="Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands">Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands</a>. Two years later, the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France.

In addition, William became hereditary <a href="/wiki/Grand_Ducal_Family_of_Luxembourg" title="Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg">Grand Duke of Luxembourg</a> in exchange for his German possessions. However, the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Revolution" title="Belgian Revolution">rebelled</a>.

<p>The Belgian Revolution at home and the <a href="/wiki/Java_War" title="Java War">Java War</a> in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the <a href="/wiki/Cultivation_System" title="Cultivation System">Cultivation System</a> was introduced in 1830; in the Dutch East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export.

The <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam_Blitz" title="Rotterdam Blitz">Rotterdam Blitz</a> forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender four days later. During the occupation, over 100,000 <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Netherlands" title="History of the Jews in the Netherlands">Dutch Jews</a> were rounded up and transported to Nazi <a href="/wiki/Extermination_camp" title="Extermination camp">extermination camps</a> of whom only a few survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany, <a href="/wiki/Dutch_resistance" title="Dutch resistance">civilians who resisted</a> were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, over 20,000 Dutch fascists <a href="/wiki/23rd_SS_Volunteer_Panzer_Grenadier_Division_Nederland" title="23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland">joined the Waffen SS</a>, fighting on the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front</a>.

On 8 December 1941, the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_government-in-exile" title="Dutch government-in-exile">Dutch government-in-exile</a> in London declared war on Japan, but could not prevent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Indonesia" title="Japanese occupation of Indonesia">the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia)</a>.

<p>In 1954, the <a href="/wiki/Charter_for_the_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands" title="Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands">Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> reformed the political structure of the Netherlands, which was a result of international pressure to carry out <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decolonisation" title="Decolonisation">decolonisation</a>.

<p>Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce <a href="/wiki/Population_density" title="Population density">population density</a> prompted some 500,000 <a href="/wiki/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch people</a> to leave the country after the war.

<p>The European area of the Netherlands lies between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latitudes" title="Latitudes">latitudes</a> <a href="/wiki/50th_parallel_north" title="50th parallel north">50°</a> and <a href="/wiki/54th_parallel_north" title="54th parallel north">54° N</a>, and longitudes <a href="/wiki/3rd_meridian_east" title="3rd meridian east">3°</a> and <a href="/wiki/8th_meridian_east" title="8th meridian east">8° E</a>.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country, with about 26% of its area and 21% of its population located below sea level, and only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">above sea level</a>. The country is for the most part flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast, up to a height of no more than 321 metres, and some low hill ranges in the central parts. Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> extraction or achieved through <a href="/wiki/Land_reclamation" title="Land reclamation">land reclamation</a>. Since the late 16th century, large <a href="/wiki/Polder" title="Polder">polder</a> areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dike_(construction)" title="Dike (construction)">dikes</a>, canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.</p>
<p>Much of the country was originally formed by the <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuaries</a> of three large European rivers: the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> (<i>Rijn</i>), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meuse_River" title="Meuse River">Meuse</a> (<i>Maas</i>) and the <a href="/wiki/Scheldt" title="Scheldt">Scheldt</a> (<i>Schelde</i>), as well as their <a href="/wiki/Tributary" title="Tributary">tributaries</a>. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a <a href="/wiki/River_delta" title="River delta">river delta</a> of these three rivers, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt_delta" title="Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta">Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta</a>.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the <a href="/wiki/Waal_(river)" title="Waal (river)">Waal</a>, its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between <a href="/wiki/Fief" title="Fief">fiefdoms</a> and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their "Great Rivers" (<i>de Grote Rivieren</i>). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the <a href="/wiki/IJssel" title="IJssel">IJssel</a> river, discharges into <a href="/wiki/IJsselmeer" title="IJsselmeer">Lake IJssel</a>, the former <a href="/wiki/Zuiderzee" title="Zuiderzee">Zuiderzee</a> ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Low_Saxon" title="Dutch Low Saxon">Dutch Low Saxon</a> dialects (except for the province of <a href="/wiki/Friesland" title="Friesland">Friesland</a>, which has its own language).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Flood_control_in_the_Netherlands" title="Flood control in the Netherlands">Flood control in the Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Floods_in_the_Netherlands" title="Floods in the Netherlands">Floods in the Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953" title="North Sea flood of 1953">North Sea flood of 1953</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Storm_tides_of_the_North_Sea" title="Storm tides of the North Sea">Storm tides of the North Sea</a></div>

<p>Over the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention. Most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134, which created the <a href="/wiki/Archipelago" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a> of <a href="/wiki/Zeeland" title="Zeeland">Zeeland</a> in the south-west.</p>
<p>On 14 December 1287, <a href="/wiki/St._Lucia%27s_flood" title="St. Lucia's flood">St. Lucia's flood</a> affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history. The <a href="/wiki/St._Elizabeth%27s_flood_(1421)" title="St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)">St. Elizabeth flood</a> of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed <a href="/wiki/Polder" title="Polder">polder</a>, replacing it with the 72-square-kilometre (28 sq mi) <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biesbosch" title="Biesbosch">Biesbosch</a></i> tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge <a href="/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953" title="North Sea flood of 1953">North Sea flood of early February 1953</a> caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deltawerken" title="Deltawerken">Delta Works</a>", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.</p>

<p>The impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying <a href="/wiki/Swamp" title="Swamp">swampland</a> was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.</p>
<p>Because of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.</p>
<p>To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AD" title="AD">AD</a>, villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called <i>terps</i>. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called <i>"<a href="/wiki/Water_board_(Netherlands)" title="Water board (Netherlands)">waterschappen</a>"</i> ("water boards") or <i>"<a href="/wiki/Water_board_(Netherlands)" title="Water board (Netherlands)">hoogheemraadschappen</a>"</i> ("high home councils") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century <a href="/wiki/Windmill" title="Windmill">windmills</a> had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous <a href="/wiki/Polder" title="Polder">polders</a>.</p>

<p>In 1932 the <i><a href="/wiki/Afsluitdijk" title="Afsluitdijk">Afsluitdijk</a></i> ("Closure Dike") was completed, blocking the former <i><a href="/wiki/Zuiderzee" title="Zuiderzee">Zuiderzee</a></i> (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the <a href="/wiki/IJsselmeer" title="IJsselmeer">IJsselmeer</a> (<a href="/wiki/IJssel" title="IJssel">IJssel</a> Lake). It became part of the larger <a href="/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works" title="Zuiderzee Works">Zuiderzee Works</a> in which four polders totalling 2,500 square kilometres (965 sq mi) were reclaimed from the sea.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. Not only is the rising sea a problem, but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Delta_works">Delta works</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Delta_Works" title="Delta Works">Delta Works</a></div>

<p>After the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/North_Sea_Flood_of_1953" title="North Sea Flood of 1953">1953 disaster</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Delta_Works" title="Delta Works">Delta Works</a> were constructed, a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Maeslantkering" title="Maeslantkering">Maeslantkering</a>. New projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising 3,000 kilometres (1,864 mi) of outer sea-dykes and 10,000 kilometres (6,214 mi) of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuaries</a> of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements. The Delta project is considered by the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" title="American Society of Civil Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> as one of the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers#World_wonders" title="American Society of Civil Engineers">seven wonders of the modern world</a>.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> in the 21st century will result in a rise in <a href="/wiki/Sea_level" title="Sea level">sea level</a> which, despite popular belief, will possibly not overwhelm the <a href="/wiki/Flood_control_in_the_Netherlands" title="Flood control in the Netherlands">measures the Netherlands has taken to control floods</a>. Even more specifically, the Netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of 1.10 metres (3.6 ft) and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 centimetres (3.9 in). The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like <a href="/wiki/Levee" title="Levee">dikes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dune" title="Dune">dunes</a> with 1.30 metres (4.3 ft) of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another program is already being executed. The <a href="/wiki/Room_for_the_River_(Netherlands)" title="Room for the River (Netherlands)">Room for the River plan</a> grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called "overflow areas" have been moved to higher ground, with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.</p>
<p>Protecting the country against floods is one element of climate change. The other is that the pressure of the sea water on ground water will increase. As a result, the fresh water table will be pushed more inland, resulting in more brackish or saline groundwater in the coastal provinces. Due to this change, some drinking water areas will be forced to apply desalination despite the apparent abundance of water. It will also affect agriculture. The <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse" title="Greenhouse">greenhouses</a> can continue their production by becoming more water efficient (they are already disconnected from the groundwater, thereby not becoming more saline), though they will need to become more energy and water efficient. The push of more brackish water into the mainland will also cause changes in flora and fauna.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<p>The predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is southwest, which causes a moderate <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_climate" title="Oceanic climate">maritime climate</a>, with warm summers and cool winters, and typically high humidity. This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline, where the difference in temperature between summer and winter, as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country.</p>
<p>The following tables are based on mean measurements by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/KNMI_(institute)" title="KNMI (institute)">KNMI</a> weather station in <a href="/wiki/De_Bilt" title="De Bilt">De Bilt</a> between 1981 and 2010:</p>

<p>Ice days (maximum temperature below 0 °C (32 °F)) usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days (minimum temperature below 0 °C (32 °F)) occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid-October and as late as mid-May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10 cm (4 in) above ground instead of 150 cm (59 in), one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but sometimes occurs in May or October too.</p>

<p>Warm days (maximum temperature above 20 °C (68 °F)) in De Bilt are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in De Bilt, however). Summer days (maximum temperature above 25 °C (77 °F)) are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September, tropical days (maximum temperature above 30 °C (86 °F)) are rare and usually occur only in June to August.</p>
<p>Precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).</p>

<p>The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has a long tradition of <a href="/wiki/Toleration" title="Toleration">social tolerance</a>.

<p>Because of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Political_parties_of_the_Netherlands" title="Political parties of the Netherlands">multi-party system</a>, no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, and <a href="/wiki/Coalition_government" title="Coalition government">coalition cabinets</a> had to be formed. Since <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a> became universal in 1919, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the <a href="/wiki/Christian_democracy" title="Christian democracy">Christian democrats</a>, currently represented by the <a href="/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Appeal" title="Christian Democratic Appeal">Christian Democratic Appeal</a> (CDA); second were the <a href="/wiki/Social_democracy" title="Social democracy">social democrats</a>, represented by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dutch_Labour_Party" title="Dutch Labour Party">Labour Party</a> (PvdA); and third were the <a href="/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_Netherlands" title="Liberalism in the Netherlands">liberals</a>, of which the right wing <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Party_for_Freedom_and_Democracy" title="People's Party for Freedom and Democracy">People's Party for Freedom and Democracy</a> (VVD) is the main representative.</p>
<p>These parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian democrats had always been a partner: so either a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Centre-left" title="Centre-left">centre-left</a> coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Centre-right" title="Centre-right">centre-right</a> coalition of Christian democrats and liberals. In the 1970s, the <a href="/wiki/Party_system" title="Party system">party system</a> became more volatile: the Christian democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the <a href="/wiki/Radicalism_(historical)" title="Radicalism (historical)">radical</a> democrat and <a href="/wiki/Progressivism" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> liberal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/D%2766" title="D'66">D66</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_1994" title="Dutch general election, 1994">1994 election</a>, the CDA lost its dominant position. A "<a href="/wiki/Purple_(government)" title="Purple (government)">purple</a>" cabinet was formed by VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2002" title="Dutch general election, 2002">2002 elections</a>, this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lijst_Pim_Fortuyn" title="Lijst Pim Fortuyn">LPF</a>, a new political party, around <a href="/wiki/Pim_Fortuyn" title="Pim Fortuyn">Pim Fortuyn</a>, who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived <a href="/wiki/First_Balkenende_cabinet" title="First Balkenende cabinet">cabinet</a> was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA leader <a href="/wiki/Jan_Peter_Balkenende" title="Jan Peter Balkenende">Jan Peter Balkenende</a>. After the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2003" title="Dutch general election, 2003">2003 elections</a>, in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Balkenende_II" title="Balkenende II">cabinet</a> was formed by CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Healthcare_in_the_Netherlands" title="Healthcare in the Netherlands">healthcare system</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Immigration_policy" title="Immigration policy">immigration policy</a>.</p>

A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Balkenende_III" title="Balkenende III">caretaker cabinet</a> was formed by CDA and VVD, and <a href="/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2006" title="Dutch general election, 2006">general elections</a> were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Party_(Netherlands)" title="Socialist Party (Netherlands)">Socialist Party</a> made the largest gains. The <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Dutch_cabinet_formation" title="2006–07 Dutch cabinet formation">formation of a new cabinet</a> took three months, resulting in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Netherlands_cabinet_Balkenende-4" title="Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4">coalition</a> of CDA, PvdA, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ChristianUnion" title="ChristianUnion">ChristianUnion</a>.</p>
<p>On 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uruzgan" title="Uruzgan">Uruzgan</a>, Afghanistan. <a href="/wiki/Snap_election" title="Snap election">Snap elections</a> were held on <a href="/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2010" title="Dutch general election, 2010">9 June 2010</a>, with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats. The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats. The big winner of the 2010 elections was <a href="/wiki/Geert_Wilders" title="Geert Wilders">Geert Wilders</a>, whose right wing <a href="/wiki/Party_for_Freedom" title="Party for Freedom">PVV</a>, the ideological successor to the <a href="/wiki/Pim_Fortuyn_List" title="Pim Fortuyn List">LPF</a>, more than doubled its number of seats. <a href="/wiki/2010_Dutch_cabinet_formation" title="2010 Dutch cabinet formation">Negotiation talks for a new government</a> resulted in a <a href="/wiki/Minority_government" title="Minority government">minority government</a>, led by VVD (a first) in coalition with CDA, which was sworn in on 14 October 2010.

<p>The history of <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_the_Netherlands" title="Foreign relations of the Netherlands">Dutch foreign policy</a> has been characterised by its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neutral_state" title="Neutral state">neutrality</a>. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> and the EU.

<p>During and after the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age" title="Dutch Golden Age">Dutch Golden Age</a>, the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire.

<p>The Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maurice_of_Nassau" title="Maurice of Nassau">Maurice of Nassau</a>. The Dutch army was used throughout the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Empire" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch Empire</a>. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a <a href="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">conscription</a> army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Revolution" title="Belgian Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a> in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Netherlands" title="Battle of the Netherlands">Netherlands was invaded in World War II</a> and quickly defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.</p>

<p>The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Brussels" title="Treaty of Brussels">Treaty of Brussels</a>, and became a founding member of <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> in 1949.

<p>The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands is the fifth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the <a href="/wiki/World_Economic_Forum" title="World Economic Forum">World Economic Forum</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Report" title="Global Competitiveness Report">Global Competitiveness Report</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from coal and gas, the country has no mining resources. The last coal mine was closed in 1974. The <a href="/wiki/Groningen_gas_field" title="Groningen gas field">Groningen gas field</a>, one of the largest <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas_field" title="Natural gas field">natural gas fields</a> in the world, is situated near <a href="/wiki/Slochteren" title="Slochteren">Slochteren</a>. Exploitation of this field has resulted in €159 billion in revenue since the mid-1970s. The field is operated by government-owned Gasunie and output is jointly exploited by the government, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil through NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij). "Gas extraction has resulted in increasingly strong earth tremors, some measuring as much as 3.6 on the Richter scale. The cost of damage repairs, structural improvements to buildings, and compensation for home value decreases has been estimated at 6.5 billion euros. Around 35,000 homes are said to be affected."</p>

<p>The Dutch agricultural sector is highly mechanised, and has a strong focus on international exports. It employs about 4% of the Dutch labour force but produces large surpluses for the food-processing industry and accounts for 21 percent of the Dutch total export value. The Dutch rank second worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind only the United States. with exports earning €80.7 billion in 2014, up from €75.4 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has, at some time in recent history, supplied one quarter of all of the world's exported tomatoes, and trade of one-third of the world's exports of <a href="/wiki/Capsicum" title="Capsicum">chilis</a>, tomatoes and cucumbers goes through the country. The Netherlands also exports one-fifteenth of the world's apples.</p>
<p>Aside from that, a significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports consists of fresh-cut plants, flowers, and flower bulbs, with the Netherlands exporting two-thirds of the world's total.</p>

<p>Mobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year, three quarters of which are done by car. Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car, 25% by bicycle, 20% walking, and 5% by public transport. With a total <a href="/wiki/Roads_in_the_Netherlands" title="Roads in the Netherlands">road network</a> of 139,295 km, which includes 2,758 km of expressways, the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world—much denser than <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, but still not as dense as <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>About 13% of all distance is travelled by public transport, the majority of which by train. <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_rail_transport_network_size" title="List of countries by rail transport network size">Like in many other European countries</a>, the Dutch rail network of 3,013 route km is also rather dense.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_the_Netherlands" title="Religion in the Netherlands">Religion in the Netherlands</a></div>

<p>Historically, the Netherlands was a predominantly <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a> society. From the onset of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, the Dutch population became divided into about two-thirds <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> (mostly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reformed" title="Reformed">Reformed</a>) and one-third <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> believers. This began to change gradually in the 20th century as there has been a steep decline in religious adherence, which continues. There was a <a href="/wiki/Pillarisation" title="Pillarisation">strong religious difference</a> between the Roman Catholic south and the Reformed north, remains of which are still in evidence. The Netherlands is currently one of the most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secular" title="Secular">secular</a> countries in the world. About 39% of the population is religiously affiliated and in 2010 fewer than 5.6% visited religious services regularly (once or more per month). In spite of an overall decline in religiosity, a countervailing trend is the religious revival in the Protestant <a href="/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)" title="Bible Belt (Netherlands)">Bible Belt</a>, and the growth of Muslim and Hindu communities.</p>
<p>Religion in the Netherlands is generally considered a personal matter and is not supposed to be propagated in public. The Dutch constitution guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Roman Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament (<a href="/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Appeal" title="Christian Democratic Appeal">CDA</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ChristianUnion" title="ChristianUnion">ChristianUnion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Reformed_Political_Party" title="Reformed Political Party">SGP</a>) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, <a href="/wiki/Pentecost" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ascension_of_Jesus" title="Ascension of Jesus">Ascension of Jesus</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is currently the largest religion in the Netherlands, accounting for about one-third of the population. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_Netherlands" title="Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands">Roman Catholicism</a> is the largest Christian religious grouping with around four million registered adherents (23.7% of the population). The provinces of <a href="/wiki/North_Brabant" title="North Brabant">North Brabant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Limburg_(Netherlands)" title="Limburg (Netherlands)">Limburg</a> have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, and their people still largely consider the Catholic Church as a base for their <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Christian" title="Cultural Christian">cultural identity</a>. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Church_in_the_Netherlands" title="Protestant Church in the Netherlands">Protestant Church in the Netherlands</a> (PKN) (10.2% of the population), a <a href="/wiki/United_and_uniting_churches" title="United and uniting churches">United</a> church which is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reformed" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lutheran" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> in orientation. It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church" title="Dutch Reformed Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Reformed_Churches_in_the_Netherlands" title="Reformed Churches in the Netherlands">Reformed Churches in the Netherlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_the_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands" title="Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands">a smaller Lutheran Church</a>. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a <a href="/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)" title="Bible Belt (Netherlands)">Bible Belt</a> from <a href="/wiki/Zeeland" title="Zeeland">Zeeland</a> to the northern parts of the province <a href="/wiki/Overijssel" title="Overijssel">Overijssel</a>, in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dutch_Royal_Family" title="Dutch Royal Family">Dutch Royal Family</a> has historically been Reformed.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a> is the second largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 <a href="/wiki/Islam_in_the_Netherlands" title="Islam in the Netherlands">Muslims</a> in the Netherlands (5% of the population). Muslim numbers increased from the 1960 as a consequence of large numbers of <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Netherlands#Im-_and_Emigration" title="Demographics of the Netherlands">migrant workers</a>. This included migrants from former <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Empire" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch colonies</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surinam" title="Surinam">Surinam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, but mainly migrant workers from <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>.

<p>Other religions account for some 6% of the Dutch people. Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are <a href="/wiki/Indo-Surinamese" title="Indo-Surinamese">Indo-Surinamese</a>. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and some Western adherents of <a href="/wiki/Hinduism_in_the_West" title="Hinduism in the West">Hinduism-oriented new religious movements</a> such as <a href="/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness" title="International Society for Krishna Consciousness">Hare Krishnas</a>.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Healthcare_in_the_Netherlands" title="Healthcare in the Netherlands">Healthcare in the Netherlands</a></div>


<p>In 2015 the Netherlands has maintained its number one position at the top of the annual <a href="/wiki/Euro_health_consumer_index" title="Euro health consumer index">Euro health consumer index</a> (EHCI), which compares healthcare systems in Europe, scoring 916 of a maximum 1,000 points. The Netherlands has been in the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for the sixth year in a row. The Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Health_care_system" title="Health care system">health care systems</a> of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Ever since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP (<a href="/wiki/Health_Consumer_Powerhouse" title="Health Consumer Powerhouse">Health Consumer Powerhouse</a>), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. But the difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Health insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zorgverzekeringswet (Zvw), often called "basic insurance", covers common medical care.</li>
<li>Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care. While Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If you don't take out insurance, you risk a fine. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Healthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (<i>huisartsen</i>, comparable to <a href="/wiki/General_practitioner" title="General practitioner">General Practitioners</a>) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon. The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most cost-effective.</p>
<p>Healthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalization, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the <i><a href="/wiki/AWBZ" title="AWBZ">Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten</a></i> ("General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.</p>
<p>For all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory <a href="/wiki/Health_insurance" title="Health insurance">health insurance</a>, with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments. This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.</p>
<p>Other sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%). Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.</p>
<p>A key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through <a href="/wiki/Risk_equalization" title="Risk equalization">risk equalization</a> and a common <a href="/wiki/Risk_pool" title="Risk pool">risk pool</a>. Funding for all short-term health care is 50% from employers, 45% from the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about 100 € per month (about US$127 in Aug. 2010 and in 2012 €150 or US$196,) with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and deductible a year €220 US$288.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has had many well-known painters.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dutch_value_system_and_etiquette">Dutch value system and etiquette</span></h3>

<p>The Dutch have a <a href="/wiki/Dutch_customs_and_etiquette" title="Dutch customs and etiquette">code of etiquette</a> which governs social behaviour and is considered important. Because of the international position of the Netherlands, many books have been written on the subject. Some customs may not be true in all regions and they are never absolute. In addition to those specific to the Dutch, many general points of <a href="/wiki/Etiquette_in_Europe" title="Etiquette in Europe">European etiquette</a> apply to the Dutch as well.</p>
<p>Dutch society is <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a>, individualistic and modern. The people tend to view themselves as modest, independent and self-reliant. They value ability over dependency. The Dutch have an aversion to the non-essential.</p>
<p>Ostentatious behaviour is to be avoided. Accumulating money is fine, but public spending of large amounts of money is considered something of a <a href="/wiki/Vice" title="Vice">vice</a> and associated with being a show-off. A high lifestyle is considered wasteful and suspect with most people. The Dutch are proud of their <a href="/wiki/Cultural_heritage" title="Cultural heritage">cultural heritage</a>, rich history in art and involvement in <a href="/wiki/International_relations" title="International relations">international affairs</a>.</p>

<p>Dutch manners are open and direct with a no-nonsense attitude; informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, <i>Their directness gives many the impression that they are rude and crude—attributes they prefer to call 'openness'</i>.</p>
<p>A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is "Dealing with the Dutch" from Jacob Vossestein: <i>Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status.</i> As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. <i>What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather</i>.</p>
<p>The majority of the Dutch are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irreligious" title="Irreligious">irreligious</a> and religion is in the Netherlands generally considered as a very personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has a well developed television market, with both multiple commercial and non-commercial broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound, and subtitled. The only exception are shows for children.</p>
<p>TV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate <a href="/wiki/Endemol" title="Endemol">Endemol</a>, founded by Dutch <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">media</a> <a href="/wiki/Business_magnate" title="Business magnate">tycoons</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_de_Mol,_Jr." title="John de Mol, Jr.">John de Mol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joop_van_den_Ende" title="Joop van den Ende">Joop van den Ende</a>.

<p>Approximately 4.5 million of the 16.8 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two-thirds of the population between 15 and 75 participates in sports weekly. <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">Football</a> is the most popular participant sport in the Netherlands, before <a href="/wiki/Field_hockey" title="Field hockey">field hockey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volleyball" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a> as the second and third most popular team sports. Tennis, gymnastics and golf are the three most widely engaged in individual sports.</p>
<p>Organisation of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the <a href="/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games" title="Summer Olympic Games">Summer Olympic Games</a> and another 110 medals at the <a href="/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games" title="Winter Olympic Games">Winter Olympic Games</a>.</p>

<p>Motorcycle racing at the TT Assen Circuit has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cuisine">Cuisine</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dutch_Cuisine" title="Dutch Cuisine">Dutch Cuisine</a></div>
<p>Originally, the country's cuisine was shaped by the practices of <a href="/wiki/Fishing" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Farming" title="Farming">farming</a>, including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals. Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables.</p>
<p>The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more <a href="/wiki/Multiculturalism" title="Multiculturalism">cosmopolitan</a>, with most <a href="/wiki/Global_cuisine" title="Global cuisine">global cuisines</a> being represented in the major cities.</p>
<p>The Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of <a href="/wiki/North_Brabant" title="North Brabant">North Brabant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Limburg_(Netherlands)" title="Limburg (Netherlands)">Limburg</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Flemish_Region" title="Flemish Region">Flemish Region</a> in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an <a href="/wiki/Haute_cuisine" title="Haute cuisine">haute cuisine</a>.</p>
<p>In early 2014, <a href="/wiki/Oxfam" title="Oxfam">Oxfam</a> ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies" title="Dutch East Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indos_in_the_Dutch_East_Indies" title="Indos in the Dutch East Indies">Indos in the Dutch East Indies</a></div>

<p>From the exploitations of the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company" title="Dutch East India Company">Dutch East India Company</a> in the 17th century, to the <a href="/wiki/New_Imperialism" title="New Imperialism">colonisations</a> in the 19th century, <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Empire" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch imperial possessions</a> continued to expand, reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies" title="Dutch East Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> in the early 20th century. The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands. Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age" title="Dutch Golden Age">Dutch Golden Age</a> of the 17th century, the Netherlands urbanised considerably, mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies. Social status was based on merchants' income, which reduced <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a> and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society. When the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dutch_Royal_Family" title="Dutch Royal Family">Dutch Royal Family</a> was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.</p>
<p>Universities such as the Royal <a href="/wiki/Leiden_University" title="Leiden University">Leiden University</a>, founded in the 16th century, have developed into leading knowledge centres for <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asian</a> and Indonesian studies. Leiden University has produced leading academics such as <a href="/wiki/Christiaan_Snouck_Hurgronje" title="Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje">Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje</a>, and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures. Leiden University and in particular <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/KITLV" title="KITLV">KITLV</a> are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies. Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam <a href="/wiki/Tropenmuseum" title="Tropenmuseum">Tropenmuseum</a>, an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art, culture, ethnography and anthropology.</p>

<p>The traditions of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Dutch_East_Indies_Army" title="Royal Dutch East Indies Army">Royal Dutch East Indies Army</a> (KNIL) are maintained by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regiment_Van_Heutsz" title="Regiment Van Heutsz">Regiment Van Heutsz</a> of the modern <a href="/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_Army" title="Royal Netherlands Army">Royal Netherlands Army</a>. A dedicated <i><a href="/wiki/Bronbeek" title="Bronbeek">Bronbeek</a> Museum</i>, a former home for retired KNIL soldiers, exists in <a href="/wiki/Arnhem" title="Arnhem">Arnhem</a> to this day.</p>
<p>A specific segment of Dutch literature called <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Indies_literature" title="Dutch Indies literature">Dutch Indies literature</a> still exists and includes established authors, such as <a href="/wiki/Louis_Couperus" title="Louis Couperus">Louis Couperus</a>, the writer of "The Hidden Force", taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration. One of the great masterpieces of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dutch_literature" title="Dutch literature">Dutch literature</a> is the book "<a href="/wiki/Max_Havelaar" title="Max Havelaar">Max Havelaar</a>", written by <a href="/wiki/Multatuli" title="Multatuli">Multatuli</a> in 1860.</p>
<p>The majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are <a href="/wiki/Indo_people" title="Indo people">Indo</a> (Eurasian), native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies. This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community. In Dutch they are referred to as <i>Indische Nederlanders</i> or as Indo (short for Indo-European).</p>
<p>Including their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands. In 2008, the Dutch Census Bureau for Statistics (CBS) registered 387,000 first- and second-generation Indos living in the Netherlands. Although considered fully assimilated into Dutch society, as the main ethnic minority in the Netherlands, these 'repatriants' have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of Indonesian culture into Dutch mainstream culture.</p>
<p>Practically every town in the Netherlands has a "Toko" (Dutch Indonesian Shop) or an Indonesian restaurant and many '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pasar_Malam" title="Pasar Malam">Pasar Malam</a>' (Night market in Malay/Indonesian) fairs are organised throughout the year. Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands. <a href="/wiki/Rijsttafel" title="Rijsttafel">Rijsttafel</a>, a colonial culinary concept, and dishes such as <a href="/wiki/Nasi_goreng" title="Nasi goreng">Nasi goreng</a> and <a href="/wiki/Satay" title="Satay">satay</a> are very popular in the Netherlands.</p>
