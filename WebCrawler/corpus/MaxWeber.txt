<p><b>Karl Emil Maximilian</b> "<b>Max</b>" <b>Weber</b> (<small>German:</small> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><a href="/wiki/Help:IPA_for_German" title="Help:IPA for German">[ˈmaks ˈveːbɐ]</a></span>; 21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociologist</a>, philosopher, jurist, and <a href="/wiki/Political_economy" title="Political economy">political economist</a> whose ideas profoundly influenced <a href="/wiki/Social_theory" title="Social theory">social theory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_research" title="Social research">social research</a>. Weber is often cited, with <a href="/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>, as among the three founders of sociology. Weber was a key proponent of <a href="/wiki/Antipositivism" title="Antipositivism">methodological antipositivism</a>, arguing for the study of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_action" title="Social action">social action</a> through <a href="/wiki/Verstehen" title="Verstehen">interpretive</a> (rather than purely <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricist</a>) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions. Unlike Durkheim, he did not believe in monocausality and rather proposed that for any outcome there can be multiple causes.</p>
<p>Weber's main intellectual concern was understanding the processes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rationalisation_(sociology)" title="Rationalisation (sociology)">rationalisation</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secularisation" title="Secularisation">secularisation</a>, and "<a href="/wiki/Disenchantment" title="Disenchantment">disenchantment</a>" that he associated with the rise of capitalism and <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modernity</a>, and which he saw as the result of a new way of thinking about the world. Weber is best known for his thesis combining <a href="/wiki/Economic_sociology" title="Economic sociology">economic sociology</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_religion" title="Sociology of religion">sociology of religion</a>, elaborated in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></i>, in which he proposed that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ascetic" title="Ascetic">ascetic</a> <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> was one of the major "elective affinities" associated with the rise in the Western world of <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market</a>-driven capitalism and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rational-legal" title="Rational-legal">rational-legal</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nation-state" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a>. He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism. Thus, it can be said that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.</p>
<p>Against Marx's <a href="/wiki/Historical_materialism" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>, Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism. The <i>Protestant Ethic</i> formed the earliest part in Weber's broader investigations into world religion; he went on to examine the <a href="/wiki/The_Religion_of_China:_Confucianism_and_Taoism" title="The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism">religions of China</a>, the <a href="/wiki/The_Religion_of_India:_The_Sociology_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism" title="The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism">religions of India</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Judaism_(book)" title="Ancient Judaism (book)">ancient Judaism</a>, with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of <a href="/wiki/Social_stratification" title="Social stratification">social stratification</a>. In another major work, "<a href="/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation" title="Politics as a Vocation">Politics as a Vocation</a>", Weber defined the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> as an entity that successfully claims a "<a href="/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence" title="Monopoly on violence">monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force</a> within a given territory". He was also the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms, which he labelled as charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal. His analysis of <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> emphasised that modern state institutions are increasingly based on <a href="/wiki/Rational-legal_authority" title="Rational-legal authority">rational-legal authority</a>.</p>
<p>Weber also made a variety of other contributions in <a href="/wiki/Economic_history" title="Economic history">economic history</a>, as well as economic theory and methodology. Weber's analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the <a href="/wiki/Critical_theory" title="Critical theory">critical theory</a> associated with the <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt_School" title="Frankfurt School">Frankfurt School</a>. After the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_World_War" title="First World War">First World War</a>, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal <a href="/wiki/German_Democratic_Party" title="German Democratic Party">German Democratic Party</a>. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Constitution" title="Weimar Constitution">Weimar Constitution</a> of 1919. After contracting <a href="/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic" title="1918 flu pandemic">Spanish flu</a>, he died of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in 1920, aged 56.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography">Biography</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life_and_family_background">Early life and family background</span></h3>
<p>Karl Emil Maximilian Weber was born in 1864, in <a href="/wiki/Erfurt" title="Erfurt">Erfurt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Saxony" title="Province of Saxony">Province of Saxony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>. He was the oldest of the seven children of <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber_Sr." title="Max Weber Sr.">Max Weber Sr.</a>, a wealthy and prominent civil servant and member of the <a href="/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(Germany)" title="National Liberal Party (Germany)">National Liberal Party</a>, and his wife Helene (Fallenstein), who partly descended from French <a href="/wiki/Huguenot" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> immigrants and held strong moral absolutist ideas.</p>
<p>Weber Sr.'s involvement in public life immersed his home in both politics and academia, as his salon welcomed many prominent scholars and public figures. The young Weber and his brother <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Weber" title="Alfred Weber">Alfred</a>, who also became a sociologist and economist, thrived in this intellectual atmosphere. Weber's 1876 Christmas presents to his parents, when he was thirteen years old, were two historical essays entitled "About the course of German history, with special reference to the positions of the Emperor and the Pope", and "About the Roman Imperial period from Constantine to the migration of nations". In class, bored and unimpressed with the teachers – who in turn resented what they perceived as a disrespectful attitude – he secretly read all forty volumes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Goethe" title="Goethe">Goethe</a>, and it has been recently argued that this was an important influence on his thought and methodology. Before entering the university, he would read many other classical works. Over time, Weber would also be significantly affected by the marital tension between his father, "a man who enjoyed earthly pleasures", and his mother, a devout <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> "who sought to lead an <a href="/wiki/Asceticism" title="Asceticism">ascetic</a> life".</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
<p>In 1882 Weber enrolled in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Heidelberg" title="University of Heidelberg">University of Heidelberg</a> as a law student. After a year of military service, he transferred to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Berlin" title="University of Berlin">University of Berlin</a>. After his first few years as a student, during which he spent much time "drinking beer and <a href="/wiki/Academic_fencing" title="Academic fencing">fencing</a>", Weber would increasingly take his mother's side in family arguments and grew estranged from his father. Simultaneously with his studies, he worked as a junior lawyer. In 1886 Weber passed the examination for <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Referendar" title="Referendar">Referendar</a></i>, comparable to the <a href="/wiki/Bar_association" title="Bar association">bar association</a> examination in the British and American legal systems. Throughout the late 1880s, Weber continued his study of law and history. He earned his law doctorate in 1889 by writing a <a href="/wiki/Thesis" title="Thesis">dissertation</a> on legal history titled <i>Development of the Principle of Joint Liability and the Separate Fund in the Public Trading Company out of Household and Trade Communities in Italian Cities</i>. This work was used as part of a longer work <i>On the History of Trading Companies in the Middle Ages, based on South-European Sources</i>, published in the same year. Two years later, Weber completed his <a href="/wiki/Habilitation" title="Habilitation">Habilitationsschrift</a>, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Agrarian_History_and_its_Significance_for_Public_and_Private_Law_(book)" title="Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law (book)">Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law</a></i>, working with <a href="/wiki/August_Meitzen" title="August Meitzen">August Meitzen</a>. Having thus become a <i><a href="/wiki/Privatdozent" title="Privatdozent">Privatdozent</a></i>, Weber joined the University of Berlin's faculty, lecturing and consulting for the government.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_work">Early work</span></h3>
<p>In the years between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber took an interest in contemporary <a href="/wiki/Social_policy" title="Social policy">social policy</a>. In 1888 he joined the <i><a href="/wiki/Verein_f%C3%BCr_Socialpolitik" title="Verein für Socialpolitik">Verein für Socialpolitik</a></i>, a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/Historical_school_of_economics" title="Historical school of economics">historical school</a>, who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues. He also involved himself in politics, joining the left-leaning <a href="/wiki/Evangelical_Social_Congress" title="Evangelical Social Congress">Evangelical Social Congress</a>. In 1890 the <i>Verein</i> established a research program to examine "the Polish question" or <i><a href="/wiki/Ostflucht" title="Ostflucht">Ostflucht</a></i>: the influx of Polish farm workers into <a href="/wiki/Former_eastern_territories_of_Germany" title="Former eastern territories of Germany">eastern Germany</a> as local labourers migrated to Germany's rapidly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialising</a> cities. Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report, which generated considerable attention and controversy and marked the beginning of Weber's renown as a social scientist. From 1893 to 1899 Weber was a member of the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alldeutscher_Verband" title="Alldeutscher Verband">Alldeutscher Verband</a></i> (Pan-German League), an organization that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers; the degree of Weber's support for the <a href="/wiki/Germanisation_of_Poles_during_the_Partitions" title="Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions">Germanisation of Poles</a> and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars. In some of his work, in particular his provocative lecture on "The Nation State and Economic Policy" delivered in 1895, Weber criticises the immigration of Poles and blames the <a href="/wiki/Junker_(Prussia)" title="Junker (Prussia)">Junker</a> class for perpetuating Slavic immigration to serve their selfish interests.</p>

<p>Also in 1893 he married his distant cousin <a href="/wiki/Marianne_Weber" title="Marianne Weber">Marianne Schnitger</a>, later a feminist activist and author in her own right, who was instrumental in collecting and publishing Weber's journal articles as books after his death, while her biography of him is an important source for understanding Weber's life. They would have no children and it is usually acknowledged that their marriage was never consummated. The marriage granted long-awaited financial independence to Weber, allowing him to finally leave his parents' household. The couple moved to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freiburg" title="Freiburg">Freiburg</a> in 1894, where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Albert-Ludwigs-Universit%C3%A4t" title="Albert-Ludwigs-Universität">university</a>, before accepting the same position at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Heidelberg" title="University of Heidelberg">University of Heidelberg</a> in 1896. There Weber became a central figure in the so-called "Weber Circle", composed of other intellectuals such as his wife Marianne, <a href="/wiki/Georg_Jellinek" title="Georg Jellinek">Georg Jellinek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Troeltsch" title="Ernst Troeltsch">Ernst Troeltsch</a>, <a href="/wiki/Werner_Sombart" title="Werner Sombart">Werner Sombart</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marc_Bloch" title="Marc Bloch">Marc Bloch</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Michels" title="Robert Michels">Robert Michels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs" title="György Lukács">György Lukács</a>. Weber also remained active in the <i>Verein</i> and the Evangelical Social Congress. His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history.</p>
<p>In 1897 Max Weber Sr. died two months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became increasingly prone to depression, nervousness and <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a>, making it difficult for him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy at the end of the year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Later_work">Later work</span></h3>
<p>After Weber's immense productivity in the early 1890s, he did not publish any papers between early 1898 and late 1902, finally resigning his professorship in late 1903. Freed from those obligations, in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the <i><a href="/wiki/Archiv_f%C3%BCr_Sozialwissenschaft_und_Sozialpolitik" title="Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik">Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare</a></i>, where he worked with his colleagues <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Edgar_Jaff%C3%A9&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Edgar Jaffé (page does not exist)">Edgar Jaffé</a><span class="noprint" style="font-size:85%; font-style: normal;"> (<a class="extiw" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Jaff%C3%A9" title="de:Edgar Jaffé">de</a>)</span> and <a href="/wiki/Werner_Sombart" title="Werner Sombart">Werner Sombart</a>. His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences; his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars. In 1904, Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal, notably his essay <i><a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></i>, which became his most famous work and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems. This essay was the only one of his works from that period that was published as a book during his lifetime. Some other of his works written in the first one and a half decades of the 20th century – published posthumously and dedicated primarily from the fields of sociology of religion, economic and legal sociology – are also recognised as among his most important intellectual contributions.</p>
<p>Also in 1904, he visited the United States and participated in the Congress of Arts and Sciences held in connection with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World%27s_Fair" title="World's Fair">World's Fair</a> (<a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase_Exposition" title="Louisiana Purchase Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a>) in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>. A monument to his visit was placed at the home of relatives whom Weber visited in Mt. Airy, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Despite his partial recovery evident in America, Weber felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the <i>Verein</i>, he co-founded the <a href="/wiki/German_Sociological_Association" title="German Sociological Association">German Sociological Association</a> (<i>Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie</i>, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social-democrats" title="Social-democrats">social-democrats</a> and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_involvements">Political involvements</span></h3>

<p>At the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Weber, aged 50, volunteered for service and was appointed as a reserve officer and put in charge of organizing the army hospitals in Heidelberg, a role he fulfilled until the end of 1915. Weber's views on the war and the expansion of the <a href="/wiki/German_colonial_empire" title="German colonial empire">German empire</a> changed during the course of the conflict. Early on he supported the nationalist rhetoric and the war effort, though with some hesitation as he viewed the war as a necessity to fulfill German duty as a leading state power. In time, however, Weber became one of the most prominent critics of German expansionism and of the <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor" title="Wilhelm II, German Emperor">Kaiser</a>'s war policies. He publicly attacked the <a href="/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan" title="Schlieffen Plan">Belgian annexation policy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare" title="Unrestricted submarine warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> and later supported calls for constitutional reform, democratisation and <a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage" title="Universal suffrage">universal suffrage</a>.</p>
<p>Weber joined the <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_council" title="Workers' council">worker and soldier council</a> of Heidelberg in 1918. He then served in the German delegation to the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference</a> and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Constitution" title="Weimar Constitution">Weimar Constitution</a>. Motivated by his understanding of the American model, he advocated a strong, <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">popularly elected</a> presidency as a constitutional counterbalance to the power of the professional <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>. More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became <a href="/wiki/Article_48_(Weimar_Constitution)" title="Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)">Article 48</a> of the Weimar Constitution. These provisions were later used by <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.</p>
<p>Weber also ran, unsuccessfully, for a parliamentary seat, as a member of the liberal <a href="/wiki/German_Democratic_Party" title="German Democratic Party">German Democratic Party</a>, which he had co-founded. He opposed both the leftist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919" title="German Revolution of 1918–1919">German Revolution of 1918–1919</a> and the ratification of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, principled positions that defied the political alignments in Germany at that time, and which may have prevented <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Ebert" title="Friedrich Ebert">Friedrich Ebert</a>, the new social-democratic President of Germany, from appointing Weber as minister or ambassador. Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence. <a href="/wiki/Weber_and_German_politics" title="Weber and German politics">Weber's role in German politics</a> remains controversial to this day.</p>
<p>In the case of Weber's critique of the left, he complained that the leaders of the leftist <a href="/wiki/Spartacus_League" title="Spartacus League">Spartacus League</a> which was led by <a href="/wiki/Karl_Liebknecht" title="Karl Liebknecht">Karl Liebknecht</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a> and controlled the city government of Berlin while Weber was campaigning for his party: "We have this [German] revolution to thank for the fact that we cannot send a single division against the Poles. All we see is dirt, muck, dung, and horse-play—nothing else. Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens.”  Weber was at the same time critical of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Versailles_Treaty" title="Versailles Treaty">Versailles Treaty</a> which he believed unjustly assigned "war guilt" to Germany when it came to World War I. Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting World War I, not just Germany. In making this case, Weber argued that “In the case of this war there is one, and only one power that desired it under all circumstances through its own will and, according to their political goals required: Russia. …It never crossed [my] mind that a German invasion of Belgium [in 1914] was nothing but an innocent act on the part of the Germans."</p>
<p>Later that same month, in January 1919, after Weber and Weber's party were defeated for election, Weber delivered one of his greatest academic lectures <a href="/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation" title="Politics as a Vocation">Politics as a Vocation</a> which was a reflection on the inherent violence and dishonesty found among the politicians, a profession in which only recently Weber was so personally active. About the nature of politicians, he concluded that "In nine out of ten cases they are windbags puffed up with hot air about themselves. They are not in touch with reality, and they do not feel the burden they need to shoulder; they just intoxicate themselves with romantic sensations."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Last_years">Last years</span></h3>

<p>Frustrated with politics, Weber resumed teaching during this time, first at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Vienna" title="University of Vienna">University of Vienna</a>, then, after 1919, at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Munich" title="University of Munich">University of Munich</a>. His lectures from that period were collected into major works, such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Wirtschaftsgeschichte" title="Wirtschaftsgeschichte">General Economic History</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Science_as_a_Vocation" title="Science as a Vocation">Science as a Vocation</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation" title="Politics as a Vocation">Politics as a Vocation</a></i>. In Munich, he headed the first German university institute of sociology, but never held a professorial position in sociology. Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the German Revolution and some right-wing students held protests in front of his home. Max Weber contracted the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spanish_flu" title="Spanish flu">Spanish flu</a> and died of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in Munich on 14 June 1920. At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing his <i>magnum opus</i> on sociological theory: <i><a href="/wiki/Economy_and_Society" title="Economy and Society">Economy and Society</a></i>. His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921–22.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Max_Weber.27s_thought">Max Weber's thought</span></h2>
<p>Max Weber's bureaucratic theory or model is sometimes also known as the "Legal-Rational" model. The model tries to explain bureaucracy from a rational point of view via nine main characteristics or principles; these are as follows:</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Max_Weber.27s_Bureaucratic_Model_.28Legal-Rational_Model.29">Max Weber's Bureaucratic Model (Legal-Rational Model)</span></h3>
<p>Weber wrote that the modern bureaucracy in both the public and private sector relies on the following principles.</p>
<p>"First, it is based on the general principle of precisely defined and organized across-the-board competencies of the various offices. These competencies are underpinned by rules, laws, or administrative regulations." For Weber, this means</p>
<ol>
<li>A rigid division of labor is established which clearly identifies the regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system.</li>
<li>There are firmly established chains of command, and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply is described by regulation.</li>
<li>Regular and continuous execution of the assigned duties is undertaken by hiring people with particular qualifications which are certified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Weber notes that these three aspects "constitute the essence of bureaucratic administration...in the public sector. In the private sector, these three aspects constitute the essence of a bureaucratic management of a private company."</p>
<p>Main Principles (Characteristics):</p>
<ol>
<li>Specialized roles.</li>
<li>Recruitment based on merit (e.g. tested through open competition).</li>
<li>Uniform principles of placement, promotion, and transfer in an administrative system.</li>
<li>Careerism with systematic salary structure.</li>
<li>Hierarchy, responsibility and accountability.</li>
<li>Subjection of official conduct to strict rules of discipline and control.</li>
<li>Supremacy of abstract rules.</li>
<li>Impersonal authority. (e.g. Office bearer does not bring the office with him).</li>
<li>Political neutrality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Merits: Max Weber himself noted, real bureaucracy will be less optimal and effective than his ideal type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerate, more so, when it is utilized to analyze the individual level in the organization. But when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regards to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.</p>
<p>Demerits: However, competencies, efficiency and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory especially when dealing with oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes feel that they are not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Inspirations">Inspirations</span></h3>
<p>Weber's thinking was strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/German_idealism" title="German idealism">German idealism</a> and particularly by <a href="/wiki/Neo-Kantianism" title="Neo-Kantianism">neo-Kantianism</a>, to which he had been exposed through <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Rickert" title="Heinrich Rickert">Heinrich Rickert</a>, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way in which the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist <a href="/wiki/Georg_Simmel" title="Georg Simmel">Georg Simmel</a>.</p>
<p>Weber was also influenced by <a href="/wiki/Kantian_ethics" title="Kantian ethics">Kantian ethics</a>, which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties. In this last respect, the influence of <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy</a> is evident. According to the <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>, the "deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview". Another major influence in Weber's life was the writings of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics. While Weber shares some of Marx's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy, Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia. Though the influence of his mother's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work, and though he maintained a deep, lifelong interest in the study of religions, Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious.</p>
<p>As a political economist and economic historian, Weber belonged to the "youngest" German <a href="/wiki/Historical_school_of_economics" title="Historical school of economics">historical school of economics</a>, represented by academics such as <a href="/wiki/Gustav_von_Schmoller" title="Gustav von Schmoller">Gustav von Schmoller</a> and his student <a href="/wiki/Werner_Sombart" title="Werner Sombart">Werner Sombart</a>. But, even though Weber's research interests were very much in line with that school, his views on methodology and the <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics)" title="Theory of value (economics)">theory of value</a> diverged significantly from those of other German historicists and were closer, in fact, to those of <a href="/wiki/Carl_Menger" title="Carl Menger">Carl Menger</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Austrian_School" title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a>, the traditional rivals of the historical school. (See section on <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber#Economics" title="Max Weber">Economics</a>.)</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Methodology">Methodology</span></h3>

<p>Unlike some other classical figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any specific set of rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Structure_and_action" title="Structure and action">structure and action</a> discussion) and whereas Marx argued for the primacy of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.</p>
<p>Sociology, for Max Weber, is:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>... a science which attempts the interpretive understanding of social action in order thereby to arrive at a causal explanation of its course and effects.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber was concerned with the question of <a href="/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">objectivity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Subjectivity" title="Subjectivity">subjectivity</a>. Weber distinguished <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_action" title="Social action">social action</a> from <a href="/wiki/Social_behavior" title="Social behavior">social behavior</a>, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through <a href="/wiki/Verstehen" title="Verstehen">interpretive means</a> (<i>Verstehen</i>) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_sciences" title="Natural sciences">natural sciences</a> and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal – although one definitely worth striving for.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>There is no absolutely "objective" scientific analysis of culture.... All knowledge of cultural reality ... is always knowledge from particular points of view.... an "objective" analysis of cultural events, which proceeds according to the thesis that the ideal of science is the reduction of empirical reality to "laws", is meaningless ... [because] ... the knowledge of social laws is not knowledge of social reality but is rather one of the various aids used by our minds for attaining this end.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber, <i>"Objectivity" in Social Science</i>, 1904</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The principle of "<a href="/wiki/Methodological_individualism" title="Methodological individualism">methodological individualism</a>", which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities (such as nations, cultures, governments, churches, corporations, etc.) solely as the result and the context of the actions of individual persons, can be traced to Weber, particularly to the first chapter of <i><a href="/wiki/Economy_and_Society" title="Economy and Society">Economy and Society</a></i>, in which he argues that only individuals "can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action". In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically only to the extent that they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models that Weber called "<a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" title="Ideal type">ideal types</a>", from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors. The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>We know of no <a href="/wiki/Scientific_law" title="Scientific law">scientifically ascertainable ideals</a>.

<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber, 1909</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber's methodology was developed in the context of a wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the <i><a href="/wiki/Methodenstreit" title="Methodenstreit">Methodenstreit</a></i>. Weber's position was close to <a href="/wiki/Historicism" title="Historicism">historicism</a>, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of <a href="/wiki/Comparative_history" title="Comparative history">comparative historical analysis</a>. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rationalisation">Rationalisation</span></h3>
<p>Many scholars have described <a href="/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)" title="Rationalization (sociology)">rationalisation</a> and the question of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work. This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Psychological" title="Psychological">psychological</a> motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily, religion) and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).</p>
<p>By rationalisation, Weber understood first, the individual cost-benefit calculation, second, the wider, bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and finally, in the more general sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (<a href="/wiki/Disenchantment" title="Disenchantment">disenchantment</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the "disenchantment of the world"</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber began his studies of the subject in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></i>, in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ascetic" title="Ascetic">ascetic</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination" title="Religious denomination">denominations</a>, particularly <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calling_(religious)" title="Calling (religious)">calling</a>). The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.</p>
<p>Weber continued his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> and on the classification of legitimate <a href="/wiki/Authority" title="Authority">authority</a> into three types – <a href="/wiki/Rational-legal_authority" title="Rational-legal authority">Rational-legal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Traditional_authority" title="Traditional authority">traditional</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charismatic_authority" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> – of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described what he saw as society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart from the rest of the world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>What Weber depicted was not only the secularisation of Western <i>culture</i>, but also and especially the development of modern <i>societies</i> from the viewpoint of rationalisation. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalisation, traditional forms of life – which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade – were dissolved.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Features of rationalisation include increasing knowledge, growing impersonality and enhanced control of social and material life. Weber was ambivalent towards rationalisation; while admitting it was responsible for many advances, in particular, freeing humans from traditional, restrictive and illogical social guidelines, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as "cogs in the machine" and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the bureaucratic <a href="/wiki/Iron_cage" title="Iron cage">iron cage</a> of rationality and bureaucracy. Related to rationalisation is the process of <a href="/wiki/Disenchantment" title="Disenchantment">disenchantment</a>, in which the world is becoming more explained and less mystical, moving from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polytheistic" title="Polytheistic">polytheistic</a> religions to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monotheistic" title="Monotheistic">monotheistic</a> ones and finally to the Godless science of <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modernity</a>. Those processes affect all of society, removing "<a href="/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)" title="Sublime (philosophy)">sublime</a> values... from public life" and making art less creative.</p>
<p>In a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dystopian" title="Dystopian">dystopian</a> critique of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern society is a product of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Individualistic" title="Individualistic">individualistic</a> drive of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reformation" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, yet at the same time, the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sociology_of_religion">Sociology of religion</span></h3>
<p>Weber's work in the field of <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_religion" title="Sociology of religion">sociology of religion</a> started with the essay <i><a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></i> and continued with the analysis of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Religion_of_China:_Confucianism_and_Taoism" title="The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism">The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Religion_of_India:_The_Sociology_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism" title="The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism">The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Ancient_Judaism_(book)" title="Ancient Judaism (book)">Ancient Judaism</a></i>. His work on other religions was interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following <i>Ancient Judaism</i> with studies of early Christianity and Islam. His three main themes in the essays were the effect of religious ideas on economic activities, the relation between <a href="/wiki/Social_stratification" title="Social stratification">social stratification</a> and religious ideas and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation.</p>
<p>Weber saw religion as one of the core forces in society. His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">Occident</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Orient" title="Orient">Orient</a>, although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the <a href="/wiki/Social_Darwinism" title="Social Darwinism">social Darwinist</a> paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western civilisation</a>. In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calvinist" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the <a href="/wiki/Social_innovation" title="Social innovation">social innovation</a> and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a> of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise. In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in <a href="/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)" title="Magic (paranormal)">magic</a>, or what he referred to as "<a href="/wiki/Disenchantment" title="Disenchantment">disenchantment</a> of the world".</p>
<p>Weber also proposed a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socioevolutionary" title="Socioevolutionary">socioevolutionary</a> model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to <a href="/wiki/Polytheism" title="Polytheism">polytheism</a>, then to <a href="/wiki/Pantheism" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monotheism" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a> and finally, <a href="/wiki/Ethical_monotheism" title="Ethical monotheism">ethical monotheism</a>. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Professionalisation" title="Professionalisation">professionalisation</a> and the evolution of ever more sophisticated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Priesthood" title="Priesthood">priesthood</a>. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></div>

<p>Weber's essay <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> is his most famous work. It is argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the <a href="/wiki/Economic_system" title="Economic system">economic system</a>. In <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, Weber put forward the thesis that <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Calvinist ethic</a> and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> elsewhere in the world.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The development of the concept of the calling quickly gave to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience – and also industrious workers; he gave to his employees as the wages of their ascetic devotion to the calling and of co-operation in his ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect of eternal salvation.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Christian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit. Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism – notably <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> – were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a>. In particular, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant_ethic" title="Protestant ethic">Protestant ethic</a> (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures. The notion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calling_(religious)" title="Calling (religious)">calling</a> meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation; just being a member of the Church was not enough. <a href="/wiki/Predestination" title="Predestination">Predestination</a> also reduced agonising over <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">economic inequality</a> and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of <a href="/wiki/Salvation" title="Salvation">salvation</a> in the afterlife. The believers thus justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy. This Weber called the "spirit of capitalism": it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind – and inevitably led to – the capitalist economic system. This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the <a href="/wiki/Base_and_superstructure" title="Base and superstructure">economic "base"</a> of society determines all other aspects of it.</p>
<p>Weber abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Troeltsch" title="Ernst Troeltsch">Ernst Troeltsch</a>, a professional theologian, had begun work on the book <i>The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects</i>. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying the groundwork for a comparative analysis of religion and society.</p>
<p>The phrase "<a href="/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic" title="Protestant work ethic">work ethic</a>" used in modern commentary is a derivative of the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant_ethic" title="Protestant ethic">Protestant ethic</a>" discussed by Weber. It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people, Jews and other non-Christians and thus lost its religious connotations.</p>

<p><i>The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism</i> was Weber's second major work on the sociology of religion. Hans H. Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C. K. Wang. Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Puritanism#Beliefs" title="Puritanism">Puritanism</a>. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese <a href="/wiki/Patrimonialism" title="Patrimonialism">patrimonialism</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Officialdom" title="Officialdom">officialdom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_China" title="Religion in China">Chinese religion</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosophy_in_China" title="Philosophy in China">philosophy</a> (primarily, <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.</p>
<p>According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of <a href="/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)" title="Rationalization (sociology)">rational thought</a>, each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma. Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth. However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference. Confucianism's goal was "a cultured status position", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are "tools of God". The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism. Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian. Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Religion_of_India:_The_Sociology_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism"><i>The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism</i></span></h4>

<p><i>The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism</i> was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the <a href="/wiki/Orthodoxy" title="Orthodoxy">orthodox</a> doctrines of <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heterodox" title="Heterodox">heterodox</a> doctrines of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The <a href="/wiki/Caste_system_in_India" title="Caste system in India">Indian caste system</a> made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soul_(spirit)" title="Soul (spirit)">soul</a>.</p>
<p>Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from <a href="/wiki/The_Religion_of_China:_Confucianism_and_Taoism" title="The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism">his previous work on China</a> to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems. He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldly <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mystical</a> experience. The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a <a href="/wiki/Prophet" title="Prophet">prophet</a> or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic. In Asia, there was no <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Messianic_prophecy" title="Messianic prophecy">Messianic prophecy</a> to give <i>plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike</i>. Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (also called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethical_prophecy" title="Ethical prophecy">ethical prophecies</a>), notably from the <a href="/wiki/Near_East" title="Near East">Near East</a> region to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exemplary_prophecy" title="Exemplary prophecy">exemplary prophecies</a> found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world. It was those differences that prevented the countries of the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">Occident</a> from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Judaism_(book)" title="Ancient Judaism (book)">Ancient Judaism</a> was an attempt to prove this theory.</p>

<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Ancient_Judaism_(book)" title="Ancient Judaism (book)">Ancient Judaism</a></i>, his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oriental" title="Oriental">Oriental</a> and <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Occidental</a> <a href="/wiki/Religiosity" title="Religiosity">religiosity</a>. He contrasted the innerworldly <a href="/wiki/Asceticism" title="Asceticism">asceticism</a> developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">prophecy</a>.</p>
<p>Weber claimed that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occidental state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures.</p>
<p>Weber's premature death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Psalm" title="Psalm">Psalms</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Job" title="Book of Job">Book of Job</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Talmudic" title="Talmudic">Talmudic</a> Jewry, early Christianity and <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>.</p>

<p>Weber's magnum opus <i><a href="/wiki/Economy_and_Society" title="Economy and Society">Economy and Society</a></i> is a collection of his essays which he was working on at the time of his death in 1920. After his death, the final organization and editing of the book fell to his widow <a href="/wiki/Marianne_Weber" title="Marianne Weber">Marianne Weber</a>. The final German form published in 1921 reflected very much Marianne Weber's work and intellectual commitment. Beginning in 1956, the German jurist <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Wincklemann&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Johannes Wincklemann (page does not exist)">Johannes Wincklemann</a> began editing and organizing the German edition of Economy and Society based on his study of the papers that Weber left at his death.</p>
<p>English versions of Economy and Society were published as a collected volume in 1968 as edited by Gunther Roth and Claus Wittich. As a result of the various editions in German and English, there are differences between the organization of the different volumes.</p>
<p>Economy and Society includes a wide range of essays dealing with Weber's views regarding Sociology, Social Philosophy, Politics, Social Stratification, World Religion, Diplomacy, and other subjects. The book is typically published in a two volume set in both German and English, and is more than 1000 pages long.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Theodicy_of_Fortune_and_Misfortune">Theodicy of Fortune and Misfortune</span></h4>
<p>The Theodicy of fortune and misfortune within sociology is the theory, as Weber suggested, of how "members of different social classes adopt different belief systems, or theodices, to explain their social situation".</p>
<p>The concept of theodicy was expanded mainly with the thought of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves to be able to be in a <i>correct</i> relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." Weber also writes that "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God...[while] theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.</p>
<p>Weber defines the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the two theodicies and to what class structures they apply. The concept of "work ethic" is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant "work ethic", there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants. Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.</p>
<p>These two theodicies can be found in the denominational segregation within the religious community. The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains. For example, mainline churches, with their upper class congregations, "promote[d] order, stability, and conservatism, and in so doing proved to be a powerful source of legitimation of the status quo and of existing disparities in the distribution of wealth and power" because much of the wealth of the church comes from the congregation. In contrast, Pentecostal churches adopted the theodicy of misfortune. They instead "advocated change intended to advance the cause of justice and fairness". Thus the learned and upper class religious churches who preach the theodicy of fortune, ultimately support capitalism and corporation, while the churches who adopted the theodicy of misfortune, instead preached equality and fairness.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Political_sociology" title="Political sociology">political sociology</a>, one of Weber's most influential contributions is his "<a href="/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation" title="Politics as a Vocation">Politics as a Vocation</a>" (<i>Politik als Beruf</i>) essay. Therein, Weber unveils the definition of the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> as that entity that possesses a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monopoly_on_the_legitimate_use_of_physical_force" title="Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force">monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force</a>., Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. A politician must not be a man of the "true Christian ethic", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the <a href="/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek. An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a <a href="/wiki/Saint" title="Saint">saint</a>, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it. The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the <i>ethic of attitude</i> and the <i>ethic of responsibility</i> ("<a class="extiw" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verantwortungsethik" title="de:Verantwortungsethik">Verantwortungsethik</a> vs <a class="extiw" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesinnungsethik" title="de:Gesinnungsethik">Gesinnungsethik</a>") and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).</p>
<p>Weber distinguished three <a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" title="Ideal type">ideal types</a> of political leadership (alternatively referred to as three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):</p>
<ol>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charismatic_domination" title="Charismatic domination">charismatic domination</a> (<a href="/wiki/Family" title="Family">familial</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religion_and_politics" title="Religion and politics">religious</a>),</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Traditional_domination" title="Traditional domination">traditional domination</a> (<a href="/wiki/Patriarch" title="Patriarch">patriarchs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patriarchy" title="Patriarchy">patrimonialism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a>) and</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legal_domination" title="Legal domination">legal domination</a> (modern law and state, <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of <a href="/wiki/Tripartite_classification_of_authority" title="Tripartite classification of authority">this tripartite distinction</a>. He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to "routinise" into a more structured form of authority. In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a "traditional revolution". The move towards a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rational-legal" title="Rational-legal">rational-legal</a> structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_evolutionism" title="Social evolutionism">social evolutionism</a> theory. This ties to his broader concept of <a href="/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)" title="Rationalization (sociology)">rationalisation</a> by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece <i><a href="/wiki/Economy_and_Society" title="Economy and Society">Economy and Society</a></i> (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term. Many aspects of modern <a href="/wiki/Public_administration" title="Public administration">public administration</a> go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called "Weberian civil service". As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society.</p>
<p>Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy: The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monetary_economy" title="Monetary economy">monetary economy</a> – these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system. Development of <a href="/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology" title="Information and communications technology">communication</a> and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Democratisation" title="Democratisation">democratisation</a> and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.</p>
<p>Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The decisive reason for the advance of the bureaucratic organisation has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organisation.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned "<a href="/wiki/Iron_cage" title="Iron cage">iron cage</a>" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control. In order to counteract bureaucrats, the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_stratification">Social stratification</span></h4>
<p>Weber also formulated a <a href="/wiki/Three-component_theory_of_stratification" title="Three-component theory of stratification">three-component theory of stratification</a>, with social class, <a href="/wiki/Social_status" title="Social status">social status</a> and political party as conceptually distinct elements. The three-component theory of stratification is in contrast to <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> simpler theory of social class which ties all social stratification to what people own. In Weber's theory, issues of honor and prestige are important. This distinction is most clearly described in Weber's essay "Classes, Staende, Parties" which was first published in his book Economy and Society. The three components of Weber's theory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Class which is based on economically determined relationship to the market (owner, <a href="/wiki/Renting" title="Renting">renter</a>, employee etc.).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Social_status" title="Social status">Status</a> (or in German <i>Stand</i>) which is based on non-economic qualities like honour, prestige and religion.</li>
<li>Party which refers to affiliations in the political domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called "<a href="/wiki/Life_chances" title="Life chances">life chances</a>" (opportunities to improve one's life).</p>
<p>Weber scholars recognize that it is important to maintain a sharp distinction between the terms "status" and "class," even though they tend to be used interchangeably in popular usage.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Study_of_the_city">Study of the city</span></h3>
<p>As part of his overarching effort to understand the unique development of the Western world, Weber produced a detailed general study of the city as the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations, political arrangements, and ideas that eventually came to define the West. This resulted in a monograph titled <i><a href="/wiki/The_City_(book)" title="The City (book)">The City</a></i>, which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–<a href="/wiki/1913" title="1913">13</a>, and which was published posthumously in 1921. In 1924 it was incorporated into the second part of his <i><a href="/wiki/Economy_and_Society" title="Economy and Society">Economy and Society</a></i>, as chapter XVI, "The City (Non-legitimate Domination)".</p>
<p>According to Weber, the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity, employed in a variety of specialised trades, and physically separated from the surrounding countryside, only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets [...] who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures. This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> status-group of the city, without which neither Judaism, nor Christianity, nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber argued that <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, early Christianity, theology, and later the political party and modern science, were only possible in the urban context that reached a full development in the West alone. He also saw in the history of <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> European cities the rise of a unique form of "non-legitimate domination" that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate domination (traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal) that had prevailed until then in the Medieval world. This new domination was based on the great economic and military power wielded by the organised community of city-dwellers ("citizens").</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h3>
<p>Weber regarded himself primarily as a "<a href="/wiki/Political_economy" title="Political economy">political economist</a>", and all of his professorial appointments were in economics, though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology. As an economist, Weber belonged to the "youngest" German <a href="/wiki/Historical_school_of_economics" title="Historical school of economics">historical school of economics</a>. The great differences between that school's interests and methods on the one hand and those of the <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_economics" title="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical school</a> (from which modern <a href="/wiki/Mainstream_economics" title="Mainstream economics">mainstream economics</a> largely derives) on the other, explain why Weber's influence on economics today is hard to discern.</p>
<p>Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Maximiliano_Korstanje&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maximiliano Korstanje (page does not exist)">Maximiliano Korstanje</a> explores the American exceptionalism and its effects on the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what <a href="/wiki/Ulrich_Beck" title="Ulrich Beck">Ulrich Beck</a> dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Methodological_individualism">Methodological individualism</span></h4>
<p>Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting <a href="/wiki/Economic_history" title="Economic history">economic history</a>, Weber's defence of "<a href="/wiki/Methodological_individualism" title="Methodological individualism">methodological individualism</a>" in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Menger" title="Carl Menger">Carl Menger</a>, the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Austrian_School" title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a> of economics, in the context of the academic <i><a href="/wiki/Methodenstreit" title="Methodenstreit">Methodenstreit</a></i> ("debate over methods") of the late 19th century. The phrase "methodological individualism", which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between <a href="/wiki/Microeconomics" title="Microeconomics">microeconomics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">macroeconomics</a>, was coined by the Austrian-American economist <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter" title="Joseph Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a> in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber. According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Induction_(philosophy)" title="Induction (philosophy)">inductive</a> or <a href="/wiki/Analytic_philosophy" title="Analytic philosophy">descriptive</a>, because <i>understanding</i> some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and <i>interpret</i> it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract "<a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" title="Ideal type">ideal (pure) types</a>". This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see <i><a href="/wiki/Verstehen" title="Verstehen">Verstehen</a></i>), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rational_economic_man" title="Rational economic man">rational economic man</a>" (<i><a href="/wiki/Homo_economicus" title="Homo economicus">homo economicus</a></i>), which is at the heart of modern <a href="/wiki/Mainstream_economics" title="Mainstream economics">mainstream economics</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Marginalism_and_psychophysics">Marginalism and psychophysics</span></h4>
<p>Unlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the <a href="/wiki/Marginalism" title="Marginalism">marginal theory of value</a> (also called "marginalism") and taught it to his students. In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weber-Fechner_law" title="Weber-Fechner law">Weber-Fechner law</a>. Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of <a href="/wiki/Psychophysics" title="Psychophysics">psychophysics</a> by <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Robbins" title="Lionel Robbins">Lionel Robbins</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Stigler" title="George Stigler">George Stigler</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek" title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>, though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of "<a href="/wiki/Behavioral_economics" title="Behavioral economics">behavioral economics</a>".</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_history">Economic history</span></h4>
<p>Weber's best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly the relations between religion and capitalism, which he explored in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a></i> as well as in his other works on the <a href="/wiki/Sociology_of_religion" title="Sociology of religion">sociology of religion</a>. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ancient_world" title="Ancient world">ancient</a> capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Die_R%C3%B6mische_Agrargeschichte_in_ihrer_Bedeutung_f%C3%BCr_das_Staats-_und_Privatrecht" title="Die Römische Agrargeschichte in ihrer Bedeutung für das Staats- und Privatrecht">economic history of Roman agrarian society</a> (1891) and on the <a href="/wiki/Condition_of_Farm_Labour_in_Eastern_Germany" title="Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany">labour relations in Eastern Germany</a> (1892), his analysis of the <a href="/wiki/Zur_Geschichte_der_Handelsgesellschaften_im_Mittelalter" title="Zur Geschichte der Handelsgesellschaften im Mittelalter">history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages</a> (1889), his critique of <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, the discussion of the roles of <a href="/wiki/Idealism" title="Idealism">idealism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Materialism" title="Materialism">materialism</a> in the history of capitalism in his <i><a href="/wiki/Economy_and_Society" title="Economy and Society">Economy and Society</a></i> (1922) and his <i><a href="/wiki/Wirtschaftsgeschichte" title="Wirtschaftsgeschichte">General Economic History</a></i> (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.</p>
<p>Although today Weber is primarily read by sociologists and <a href="/wiki/Social_philosophy" title="Social philosophy">social philosophers</a>, Weber's work did have a significant influence on <a href="/wiki/Frank_Knight" title="Frank Knight">Frank Knight</a>, one of the founders of the neoclassical <a href="/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics" title="Chicago school of economics">Chicago school of economics</a>, who translated Weber's <i>General Economic History</i> into English in 1927. Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism "from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense".</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_calculation">Economic calculation</span></h4>
<p>Weber, like his colleague <a href="/wiki/Werner_Sombart" title="Werner Sombart">Werner Sombart</a>, regarded <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis" title="Cost-benefit analysis">economic calculation</a> and especially the <a href="/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system" title="Double-entry bookkeeping system">double-entry bookkeeping</a> method of business accounting, as one of the most important forms of <a href="/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)" title="Rationalization (sociology)">rationalisation</a> associated with the development of modern capitalism. Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs. Socialist intellectuals like <a href="/wiki/Otto_Neurath" title="Otto Neurath">Otto Neurath</a> had realised that in a completely socialised economy, <a href="/wiki/Price" title="Price">prices</a> would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) <a href="/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem" title="Economic calculation problem">economic calculation</a>. According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Imputation_(economics)" title="Imputation (economics)">imputation</a> (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of <a href="/wiki/Capital_good" title="Capital good">capital goods</a>). Weber wrote that, under full socialism,</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>In order to make possible a rational utilisation of the means of production, a system of in-kind accounting would have to determine "value" – indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the "prices" used in book valuation in modern business accounting. But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular, verified; whether, for instance, they should vary from one production unit to the next (on the basis of economic location), or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy, on the basis of "social utility", that is, of (present and future) consumption requirements [...] Nothing is gained by assuming that, if only the problem of a non-monetary economy were seriously enough attacked, a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented. The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation. We cannot speak of a rational "planned economy" so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational "plan".</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Max Weber</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument against socialism was made independently, at about the same time, by <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises" title="Ludwig von Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>. Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918, and, through Mises, on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century. <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek" title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a> in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics's intellectual assault on socialism, as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of "<a href="/wiki/Dispersed_knowledge" title="Dispersed knowledge">dispersed knowledge</a>" in markets.</p>

Others though disagree, pointing out that despite the fact that Weber did write in the early twentieth century, his ideas remain alive and relevant for understanding issues like politics, bureaucracy, and social stratification today.</p>
<p>Many scholars, however, have disagreed with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter" title="Joseph Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a> argued that capitalism did not begin with the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> but in 14th century Italy. In <a href="/wiki/Milan" title="Milan">Milan</a>, Venice and <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> the small <a href="/wiki/Italian_city-states" title="Italian city-states">city-state</a> governments led to the development of the earliest forms of capitalism. In the 16th century <a href="/wiki/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland. Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labour_theory_of_value" title="Labour theory of value">labour theory of value</a>.</p>

<p>Weber wrote in German. Original titles printed after his death (1920) are most likely <a href="/wiki/Anthology" title="Anthology">compilations</a> of his unfinished works (of the <i>Collected Essays…</i> form). Many translations are made of parts or sections of various German <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Original" title="Original">originals</a> and the names of the translations often do not reveal what part of German work they contain. Weber's work is generally quoted according to the critical <i>Weber Gesamtausgabe</i> (collected works edition), which is published by Mohr Siebeck in <a href="/wiki/T%C3%BCbingen" title="Tübingen">Tübingen</a>.</p>
