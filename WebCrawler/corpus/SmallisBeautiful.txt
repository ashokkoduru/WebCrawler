<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Synopsis">Synopsis</span></h2>
<p>The book is divided into four parts: "The Modern World", "Resources", "The Third World", and "Organization and Ownership".</p>
<p>In the first chapter, "The Problem of Production", Schumacher argues that the modern <a href="/wiki/Economy" title="Economy">economy</a> is unsustainable. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_resources" title="Natural resources">Natural resources</a> (like <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>), are treated as expendable <a href="/wiki/Income" title="Income">income</a>, when in fact they should be treated as <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>, since they are not renewable, and thus subject to eventual depletion. He further argues that nature's resistance to <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> is limited as well. He concludes that government effort must be concentrated on <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>, because relatively minor improvements, for example, <a href="/wiki/Technology_transfer" title="Technology transfer">technology transfer</a> to <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> countries, will not solve the underlying problem of an unsustainable economy.</p>
<p>Schumacher's philosophy is one of "enoughness", appreciating both human needs and limitations, and <a href="/wiki/Appropriate_technology" title="Appropriate technology">appropriate use of technology</a>. It grew out of his study of village-based economics, which he later termed <a href="/wiki/Buddhist_economics" title="Buddhist economics">Buddhist economics</a>, which is the subject of the book's fourth chapter.</p>
<p>He faults conventional economic thinking for failing to consider the most appropriate scale for an activity, blasts notions that "growth is good", and that "bigger is better", and questions the appropriateness of using mass production in developing countries, promoting instead "production by the masses". Schumacher was one of the first economists to question the appropriateness of using <a href="/wiki/Gross_national_product" title="Gross national product">gross national product</a> to measure human <a href="/wiki/Well-being" title="Well-being">well-being</a>, emphasizing that "the aim ought to be to obtain the maximum amount of well being with the minimum amount of consumption". In the epilogue he emphasizes the need for the "philosophy of materialism" to take second place to ideals such as justice, harmony, beauty, and health.</p>
