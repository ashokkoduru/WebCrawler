<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Founding">Founding</span></h3>
<p>The Goodwood Festival of Speed was founded in 1993 by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Gordon-Lennox,_Earl_of_March_and_Kinrara" title="Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara">Lord March</a> in order to bring motor racing back to the Goodwood estate — a location steeped in British motor racing history. Shortly after taking over the estate in the early 1990s, Lord March (as he is formally known) wanted to bring back motor racing to <a href="/wiki/Goodwood_Circuit" title="Goodwood Circuit">Goodwood Circuit</a>, but did not have the necessary permit to host a race there. Therefore, he instead hosted it on his own grounds. With a small selection of entrants made up of invited historic vehicles, the first event that took place on Sunday 13 June proved to be a success, taking in a crowd of 25,000 despite a date clash with the <a href="/wiki/1993_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="1993 24 Hours of Le Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans that year</a>. After the first event's date clash, Lord March would ensure that the event would never be allowed to clash with either Le Mans or <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> races. In 1994, Saturday was added, making it a weekend event. In 1996, Friday was added, making it a three-day event. In 2010, the <a href="#The_Moving_Motor_Show">Moving Motor Show</a> was added on the Thursday.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_hill_climb">The hill climb</span></h4>

<p>Thanks to the event's classification as a <a href="/wiki/Hillclimbing" title="Hillclimbing">hill climb</a>, its location and desire to reflect the style and history of motor sport, visitors are afforded close views of the action - separated only by a few metres and reinforced straw bales from the track. Visitors are free to walk around several paddocks where the cars and drivers can be seen at close quarters. The atmosphere of the Festival of Speed, when compared to the separation of fans from drivers and machines common to most top end motor sport events, encourages participation by the fans.</p>
<p>The track has an elevation change of 92.7 metres, for an average gradient of 4.9%. The record time for the hillclimb was set in 1999 when <a href="/wiki/Nick_Heidfeld" title="Nick Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a> drove a <a href="/wiki/McLaren_MP4/13" title="McLaren MP4/13">McLaren MP4/13</a> Formula One car up the hill in 41.6 seconds (100.385 mph (161.554 km/h)). For safety reasons Formula One cars are no longer allowed to do official timed runs, and will often focus on demonstrations that are spectacular rather than fast. In 2006 <a href="/wiki/Heikki_Kovalainen" title="Heikki Kovalainen">Heikki Kovalainen</a> completed the course in a <a href="/wiki/Renault_R25" title="Renault R25">Renault R25</a> F1 car and was unofficially timed below 40 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2016, to commemorate the 40 year anniversary of <a href="/wiki/James_Hunt" title="James Hunt">James Hunt</a> winning the F1 World Championship, McLaren commissioned a P1 GTR which ran up the hill driven by <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Senna" title="Bruno Senna">Bruno Senna</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Soapbox_challenge">Soapbox challenge</span></h4>
<p>From 2000 to 2004 this was a downhill race for gravity-powered cars. Starting from just below the hill-climb finish line, to a finish line in front of the house. It included entries from <a href="/wiki/Cosworth" title="Cosworth">Cosworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prodrive" title="Prodrive">Prodrive</a>, and other top companies. With some famous riders/drivers piloting them, including <a href="/wiki/Barry_Sheene" title="Barry Sheene">Barry Sheene</a>. However, there were frequent accidents. Despite an official cap on the cost of cars, the unofficial costs were becoming too high, so it did not return in 2005.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_forest_rally_stage">The forest rally stage</span></h4>
<p>From 2005 to present there has been a demonstration area for the rally cars at the top of the hill. Initially, in 2005, the track through the forest was widened, and the rally cars ran down through the forest, turned on the tarmac section just outside the wood, and returned up the same track. This meant that the cars could only run one-at-a-time.<br/>
In 2006, a full forest stage was introduced, designed by <a href="/wiki/Hannu_Mikkola" title="Hannu Mikkola">Hannu Mikkola</a> this was a complete circuit, with a separate start and finish line at the top of the wood. This allowed the cars to start at timed intervals, allowing many more cars to run. Ever since its inception Southern Car Club have been entrusted with the organization of the rally stage, held under an MSA permit.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supercar_run">Supercar run</span></h4>
<p>Since 2000, there has been a <b><i>Sunday Times</i> Supercar Run</b>, for road-going <a href="/wiki/Supercar" title="Supercar">supercars</a>. Since 2014 cars could opt to do a timed run. It is now common for specialty car manufacturers to show off their latest sports model, including newly released mass-produced sports models and working <a href="/wiki/Concept_car" title="Concept car">concept models</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cartier_Style_et_Luxe">Cartier Style et Luxe</span></h4>
<p>Since 1995 this is an <a href="/wiki/Auto_show" title="Auto show">auto show</a> which takes place to the west of the house. It is a similar format to the <a href="/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d%27Elegance" title="Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance">Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance</a>. Entry is usually by invitation, and this provides some leeway as to which type of vehicle can enter, usually resulting in a more varied event than usual <a href="/wiki/Concours_d%27Elegance" title="Concours d'Elegance">Concours d'Elegance</a>. Unlike most concours shows, the <i>Cartier Style et Luxe</i> is judged by a panel of selected judges consisting of celebrities from all around the world to car designers.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Moving_Motor_Show">The Moving Motor Show</span></h4>
<p>Since 2010, the <b>Moving Motor Show</b>, was added. Mainly in response to the cancellation of the <a href="/wiki/British_International_Motor_Show" title="British International Motor Show">British International Motor Show</a> aimed exclusively for buyers of new cars, allowing them a chance to test the cars on the course. Following its success, it was announced the MMS would return in 2011.</p>

<p>The 2010 event also included the running of the new McLaren MP4-12C.</p>
<p>The official website lists the Festival of speed dates as the Friday to Sunday, but the weekend tickets for the Festival include a moving motor show ticket. So it's not strictly part of the Festival of Speed, but it is a part of the Festival of Speed weekend.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h4>
<p>Other popular attractions at the event are the real life replicas of the <a href="/wiki/Wacky_Races" title="Wacky Races">Wacky Races</a> cars, which serves to provide lunchtime entertainment for the crowds, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Airshow" title="Airshow">airshows</a>, which usually include the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> <a href="/wiki/Panavia_Tornado" title="Panavia Tornado">Tornado</a> and <a href="/wiki/Red_Arrows" title="Red Arrows">Red Arrows</a>, and in 2004 and 2005 a low-flying <a href="/wiki/Boeing_747" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a>; a low-flying <a href="/wiki/Airbus_A380" title="Airbus A380">Airbus A380</a> appeared at the 2008 event.</p>
<p>From the festival's beginning, poster art had been illustrated by renowned motor racing artist Peter Hearsey until his retirement in 2015. In 2016, the poster art was designed by Klaus Wagger, who rose to prominence as a racing artist when he won a competition to design the official poster for <a href="/wiki/Mille_Miglia" title="Mille Miglia">Mille Miglia</a> in 2000.</p>
<p>In recent years, they have also put on the GAS Arena (Goodwood Action Sports) who showcase extreme stunts such as Freestyle Motorcross, BMX and Trial bike Riding </p>

<p>There have been two separate fatal accidents at the event.</p>
<p>The first was during its inaugural meeting in 1993, when vintage racing motorcyclist Chas Guy was killed in practice following the completion of the course when his Vincent motorcycle developed a steering wobble known as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tank_slapper" title="Tank slapper">tank slapper</a>, throwing the rider into a tree. Since then, motorcycles are not timed for their run.</p>
<p>In 2000, driver John Dawson-Damer lost control of his <a href="/wiki/Lotus_63" title="Lotus 63">Lotus 63</a>, and crashed into the finish line <a href="/wiki/Gantry_(road_sign)" title="Gantry (road sign)">gantry</a>, killing himself and marshal Andrew Carpenter.
