<p>In ethics, <b>value</b> denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deontology" title="Deontology">deontology</a>), or to describe the significance of different actions (<a href="/wiki/Axiology" title="Axiology">axiology</a>). It may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects, putting value to them. It deals with right conduct and good life, in the sense that a highly, or at least relatively highly, valuable action may be regarded as ethically "good" (<a href="/wiki/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjective</a> sense), and an action of low in value, or somewhat relatively low in value, may be regarded as "bad". What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethic values of the objects it increases, decreases or alters. An object with "ethic value" may be termed an "ethic or philosophic good" (<a href="/wiki/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a> sense).</p>
<p>Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what "ought" to be. "Equal rights for all", "Excellence deserves admiration", and "People should be treated with respect and dignity" are representative of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior. Types of values include <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical</a>/<a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">moral</a> values, <a href="/wiki/Doctrine" title="Doctrine">doctrinal</a>/<a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideological</a> (religious, political) values, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">social</a> values, and <a href="/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetic</a> values. It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as <a href="/wiki/Altruism" title="Altruism">altruism</a>, are <a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics)" title="Intrinsic value (ethics)">intrinsic</a>, and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as <a href="/wiki/Vice" title="Vice">vices</a> or <a href="/wiki/Virtue" title="Virtue">virtues</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Study">Study</span></h2>
<p>Ethical value may be regarded as a study under <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, which, in turn, may be grouped as <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. Similar to that ethics may be regarded as a subfield of philosophy, <i>ethical value</i> may be regarded as a subgroup of the more broad (and vague) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosophic_value" title="Philosophic value">philosophic value</a>. Ethical value denotes something's degree importance, with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. It may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects, putting value to them. It deals with right conduct and good life, in the sense that a highly, or at least relatively highly, valuable action or may be regarded as <i>good</i>, and an action of low, or at least relatively low, value may be regarded as <i>bad</i>.</p>
<p>The study of ethical value is also included in <a href="/wiki/Value_theory" title="Value theory">value theory</a>. In addition, values have been studied in various disciplines: <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Behavioral_economics" title="Behavioral economics">behavioral economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Business_ethics" title="Business ethics">business ethics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corporate_governance" title="Corporate governance">corporate governance</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moral_philosophy" title="Moral philosophy">moral philosophy</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Political_sciences" title="Political sciences">political sciences</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">social psychology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theology</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Similar_concepts">Similar concepts</span></h3>
<p><i>Ethical value</i> is sometimes used synonymously with <a href="/wiki/Good_and_evil" title="Good and evil">goodness</a>. However, goodness has many other meanings as well, and may be regarded as more ambiguous.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_versus_cultural_perspectives">Personal versus cultural perspectives</span></h2>
<p>Personal values exist in relation to cultural values, either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms. A culture is a social system that shares a set of common values, in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good, beautiful and constructive. Without normative personal values, there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_values">Personal values</span></h3>
<p>Personal values provide an internal reference for what is good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable and constructive. Values generate behaviour and influence the choices made by an individual.</p>
<p>Values may help <a href="/wiki/Problem_solving" title="Problem solving">solve</a> common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value, the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them. Moral, religious, and personal values, when held rigidly, may also give rise to <a href="/wiki/Conflict_(process)" title="Conflict (process)">conflicts</a> that result from a clash between differing <a href="/wiki/World_view" title="World view">world views</a>.</p>
<p>Over time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives, lay the foundations of law, custom and tradition. Recent research has thereby stressed the <i>implicit nature of value communication</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_values">Cultural values</span></h3>

<p>Individual <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">cultures</a> emphasize values which their members broadly share. One can often identify the values of a <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a> by noting which people receive honor or respect. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>, for example, professional athletes at the top levels in some sports receive more honor (measured in terms of monetary payment) than university professors. Surveys show that voters in the United States would not willingly elect an atheist as president, suggesting belief in a God as a generally shared value.</p>
<p><b>Values clarification</b> differs from <b>cognitive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moral_education" title="Moral education">moral education</a></b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value clarification consists of "helping people clarify what their <a href="/wiki/Personal_life" title="Personal life">lives</a> are for and what is worth working for. It encourages students to define their own values and to understand others' values."</li>
<li>Cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">justice</a> as their moral reasoning develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Values relate to the <a href="/wiki/Norm_(social)" title="Norm (social)">norms of a culture</a>, but they are more global and abstract than norms. Norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations, while values identify what should be judged as <a href="/wiki/Good_and_evil" title="Good and evil">good or evil</a>. While norms are standards, patterns, rules and guides of expected behavior, values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile. Flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm, but it reflects the value of <a href="/wiki/Patriotism" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a>. Wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest <a href="/wiki/Respect" title="Respect">respect</a> at a funeral. Different cultures reflect values differently and to different levels of emphasis. "Over the last three decades, traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others." Values seemed to have changed, affecting the beliefs, and attitudes of the students.</p>
<p>Members take part in a culture even if each member's personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture. This reflects an individual's ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple <a href="/wiki/Subculture" title="Subculture">subcultures</a> they belong to.</p>
<p>If a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group's norms, the group's authority may carry out various ways of encouraging <a href="/wiki/Conformity" title="Conformity">conformity</a> or <a href="/wiki/Social_stigma" title="Social stigma">stigmatizing</a> the <a href="/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)" title="Deviance (sociology)">non-conforming behavior</a> of that member. For example, imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, institutions in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_economy" title="Global economy">global economy</a> can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a "triangle of coherence". In the first instance, a value may come to expression within the World Trade Organization (<a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" title="World Trade Organization">WTO</a>), as well as (in the second instance) within the United Nations - particularly in the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (<a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>) - providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability. In the third instance, the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules, to preserve the expression of <a href="/wiki/Identity_(social_science)" title="Identity (social science)">identity</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalized world</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in warlike economic competition, differing views may contradict each other, particularly in the field of culture. Thus audiences in Europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment, while audiences in the United States may see it as mere entertainment, whatever its artistic merits. <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a> policies based on the notion of "cultural exception" can become juxtaposed with the policy of "cultural specificity" on the liberal Anglo-Saxon side. Indeed, <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service. Consequently, cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the Anglo-Saxon liberal position, causing failures in international negotiations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transmission">Transmission</span></h2>
<p>Values are generally received through cultural means, especially transmission from parents to children. Parents in different cultures have different values. For example, parents in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hunter%E2%80%93gatherer" title="Hunter–gatherer">hunter–gatherer</a> society or surviving through <a href="/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture" title="Subsistence agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a> value practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays. Italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament. Spanish parents want their children to be sociable. Swedish parents value security and happiness. Dutch parents value independence, long attention spans, and predictable schedules. American parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability, especially in a narrow "book learning" sense. The <a href="/wiki/Kipsigis_people" title="Kipsigis people">Kipsigis people</a> of Kenya value children who are not only smart, but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way, which they call <i>ng'om</i>. Luos of Kenya value education and pride which they call "nyadhi".</p>
<p>The reception of values can be regarded as a part of <a href="/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">socialization</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties_and_forms">Properties and forms</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relative_or_absolute">Relative or absolute</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Relativism" title="Relativism">Relative</a> values differ between people, and on a larger scale, between people of different cultures. On the other hand, there are theories of the existence of <i>absolute values</i>, which can also be termed <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Noumenal" title="Noumenal">noumenal</a> values</i> (and not to be confused with mathematical <a href="/wiki/Absolute_value" title="Absolute value">absolute value</a>). An absolute value can be described as <a href="/wiki/Absolute_(philosophy)" title="Absolute (philosophy)">philosophically absolute</a> and independent of individual and cultural views, as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not. <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects; <i>"we can speak as much as we want about "life" and "<a href="/wiki/Meaning_of_life" title="Meaning of life">its meaning</a>," and believe that what we say is important. But these are no more than expressions and can never be facts, resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will".</i></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intrinsic_or_extrinsic">Intrinsic or extrinsic</span></h3>
<p>Philosophic value may be split into <i><a href="/wiki/Instrumental_value" title="Instrumental value">instrumental value</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics)" title="Intrinsic value (ethics)">intrinsic values</a></i>. An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value <a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties_(philosophy)" title="Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)">intrinsic and extrinsic properties</a>.</p>
<p>An <i>ethic good</i> with <i>instrumental value</i> may be termed an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethic_mean" title="Ethic mean">ethic mean</a>, and an <i>ethic good</i> with <i>intrinsic value</i> may be termed an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/End-in-itself" title="End-in-itself">end-in-itself</a>. An object may be both a mean and end-in-itself.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Summation">Summation</span></h4>
<p>Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories. Some objects are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other objects that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods. In these cases, the <a href="/wiki/Summation" title="Summation">sum</a> of instrumental (specifically the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/All_instrumental_value" title="All instrumental value">all instrumental value</a>) and instrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Value_system" title="Value system">value systems</a>, which is a set of consistent values and measures.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intensity">Intensity</span></h3>
<p>The <i>intensity</i> of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out, and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good, the object having the value.</p>
<p>It should not be confused with the amount of value per object, although the latter may vary too, e.g. because of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instrumental_value_conditionality" title="Instrumental value conditionality">instrumental value conditionality</a>. For example, taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself, the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten, and is zero when no waffles are eaten, e.g. if no waffles are present. Still, each waffle that had been present would still have value, no matter if it was being eaten or not, independent on intensity.</p>
<p><i>Instrumental value conditionality</i> in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present, making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible.</p>
<p>In many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_stances" title="Life stances">life stances</a> it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable, i.e. not only to generate value, but to generate it in large degree. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Maximization_(ethics)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maximization (ethics) (page does not exist)">Maximizing</a> lifestances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Homology_in_physics">Homology in physics</span></h4>
<p>When comparing to the homologous measure in physics, then <a href="/wiki/Intensity_(physics)" title="Intensity (physics)">intensity in physics</a> may not be the best example, but may better be described as its area. In this sense, <a href="/wiki/Power_(physics)" title="Power (physics)">power in physics</a> may be compared to the amount of value per object, and physical intensity the product of value per object and ethic intensity. If there is no physical area, then no energy is generated, regardless of physical power. In the same way, if there is no ethic intensity, then no total value is generated, regardless of value per object.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Positive_and_negative_value">Positive and negative value</span></h3>
<p>There may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value. While positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized, negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized.</p>
<p>Negative value may be both <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intrinsic_negative_value" title="Intrinsic negative value">intrinsic negative value</a> and/or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instrumental_negative_value" title="Instrumental negative value">instrumental negative value</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Protected_value">Protected value</span></h3>
<p>A <i>protected value</i> (also sacred value) is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be. For example, some people may be unwilling to kill another person, even if it means saving many others individuals. Protected values tend to be "<a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics)" title="Intrinsic value (ethics)">intrinsically good</a>", and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary. If such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called <i>tragic trade-offs.</i></p>
<p>Protected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts (e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict" title="Israeli–Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>) because they can hinder businesslike (''utilitarian'') negotiations. From the perspective of <a href="/wiki/Utilitarianism" title="Utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, protected values are <a href="/wiki/Bias" title="Bias">biases</a> when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Baron" title="Jonathan Baron">Jonathan Baron</a> and Mark Spranca, protected values arise from <a href="/wiki/Norm_(philosophy)" title="Norm (philosophy)">norms</a> as described in theories of <a href="/wiki/Deontological_ethics" title="Deontological ethics">deontological ethics</a> (the latter often being referred to in context with <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>). The protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Value_system">Value system</span></h2>
<p>A <i>value system</i> is a set of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consistent" title="Consistent">consistent</a> values used for the purpose of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethical" title="Ethical">ethical</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ideological" title="Ideological">ideological</a> <a href="/wiki/Integrity" title="Integrity">integrity</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consistency">Consistency</span></h3>
<p>As a member of a society, group or community, an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time. In this case, the two value systems (one personal and one communal) are <b>externally <a href="/wiki/Consistency" title="Consistency">consistent</a></b> provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them.</p>
<p>A value system in its own right is <b>internally consistent</b> when</p>
<ul>
<li>its values <i>do not contradict</i> each other and</li>
<li>its exceptions are or could be
<ul>
<li><i>abstract</i> enough to be used in all situations and</li>
<li><i>consistently</i> applied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, a value system by itself is <b>internally inconsistent</b> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>its values <i>contradict</i> each other and</li>
<li>its exceptions are
<ul>
<li>highly <i>situational</i> and</li>
<li><i>inconsistently</i> applied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Value_exceptions">Value exceptions</span></h3>
<p><b>Abstract</b> exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values. Their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations. <b>Situational</b> exceptions, on the other hand, are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations. The presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <b>idealized</b> value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions. It is, therefore, absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior. Those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions (other than the default) are called <i>absolutists</i>.</li>
<li>A <b>realized</b> value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances. This type is what people tend to use in daily life.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it, thus holding a different value system. For example, a <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a> lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions.</p>
<p>Implicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a <b>formal</b> value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value: "as long as no higher-priority value is violated". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someone’s life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conflict">Conflict</span></h3>
<p>Although sharing a set of common values, like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit, two different parties might not rank those values equally. Also, two parties might disagree as to certain actions are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Right_(ethics)" title="Right (ethics)">right</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wrong" title="Wrong">wrong</a>, both in theory and in practice, and find themselves in an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ideological" title="Ideological">ideological</a> or physical conflict. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethonomics" title="Ethonomics">Ethonomics</a>, the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems, enables us to understand <a href="/wiki/Politics" title="Politics">politics</a> and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>An example conflict would be a value system based on <a href="/wiki/Individualism" title="Individualism">individualism</a> pitted against a value system based on <a href="/wiki/Collectivism" title="Collectivism">collectivism</a>. A rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below. Note that added exceptions can become <a href="/wiki/Recursion" title="Recursion">recursive</a> and often convoluted.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Individuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others' freedom or with functions of society that individuals need, provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals.</i></li>
<li><i>A society (or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society) exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society. The functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society.</i></li>
<li><i>A society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society. The failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.</i></li>
<li><i>A society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society, only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values. This means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values.</i></li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_and_philosophic_value">Economic and philosophic value</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Value_(economics)" title="Value (economics)">Value (economics)</a></div>
<p>Philosophical value is distinguished from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic_value" title="Economic value">economic value</a>, since it is independent on some other desired condition or commodity. The economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity, e.g. money, become high in supply, and vice versa when supply of money becomes low.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value. In the <a href="/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value" title="Subjective theory of value">subjective theory of value</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_philosophic_value" title="Personal philosophic value">personal philosophic value</a> a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it. The limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the <i>personal philosophic value</i> of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it, e.g. money. In this light, everything can be said to have a "personal economic value" in contrast to its "societal economic value."</p>
