<p><b>Energy storage</b> is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an <a href="/wiki/Accumulator_(energy)" title="Accumulator (energy)">accumulator</a>. Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation, <a href="/wiki/Chemical_energy" title="Chemical energy">chemical</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gravitation" title="Gravitation">gravitational potential</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_potential_energy" title="Electric potential energy">electrical potential</a>, electricity, elevated temperature, <a href="/wiki/Latent_heat" title="Latent heat">latent heat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic</a>. Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms. Bulk energy storage is dominated by pumped hydro, which accounts for 99% of global energy storage.</p>
<p>Some technologies provide short-term energy storage, while others can endure for much longer.</p>
<p>A wind-up clock stores potential energy (in this case mechanical, in the spring tension), a <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery" title="Rechargeable battery">rechargeable battery</a> stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone, and a <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> dam stores <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_power_industry" title="Electrical power industry">energy</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoir</a> as gravitational <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy" title="Potential energy">potential energy</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">Fossil fuels</a> such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">Food</a> (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> form.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ice_storage_air_conditioning" title="Ice storage air conditioning">Ice storage</a> tanks store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling. The energy isn't stored directly, but the work-product of consuming energy (pumping away heat) is stored, having the equivalent effect on daytime consumption.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prehistory">Prehistory</span></h3>
<p>The energy present at the initial formation of the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a> is stored in stars such as the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>, and is used by humans directly (e.g. through <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar heating</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sun_tanning" title="Sun tanning">sun tanning</a>), or indirectly (e.g. by growing crops, consuming photosynthesized plants or conversion into electricity in solar cells).</p>
<p>As a purposeful activity, energy storage has existed since pre-history, though it was often not explicitly recognized as such. An example of mechanical energy storage is the use of logs or boulders as defensive measures in ancient forts—the logs or boulders were collected at the top of a hill or wall, and the energy thus stored was used to attack invaders who came within range. Certainly, storing dried wood or another source for fire, or preserving edible food or seeds, in dry or cool areas such as in a cave, under rocks or underground, serves as other examples of energy storage.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_History">Recent History</span></h3>
<p>In the twentieth century grid electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel. When less power was required, less fuel was burned. Concerns with air pollution, energy imports and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power. Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed. Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours, while demand often peaks after sunset (<i>see</i> <a href="/wiki/Duck_curve" title="Duck curve">duck curve</a>). Interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the renewable energy industry begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Off-the-grid" title="Off-the-grid">Off grid electrical</a> use was a niche market in the twentieth century, but in the twenty first century it has expanded. Portable devices are in use all over the world. Solar panels are now a common sight in the rural settings worldwide. Access to electricity is now a question of economics, not location. Powering transportation without burning fuel, however, remains in development.</p>

<p>Energy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pumped_storage" title="Pumped storage">pumped storage</a> methods and also by moving solid matter to higher locations. Other commercial mechanical methods include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compressed-air_energy_storage" title="Compressed-air energy storage">compressing air</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage" title="Flywheel energy storage">flywheels</a> that convert electric energy into kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">Hydroelectricity</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">Hydroelectric dams</a> with reservoirs can be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand. Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high. The net effect is similar to pumped storage, but without the pumping loss.</p>
<p>While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources. In this mode, dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage, because only the timing of its generation changes. Hydroelectric turbines have a start-up time on the order of a few minutes.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pumped-storage">Pumped-storage</span></h4>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">Pumped-storage hydroelectricity</a></div>
<p>Worldwide, pumped-storage <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> (PSH) is the largest-capacity form of active <a href="/wiki/Grid_energy_storage" title="Grid energy storage">grid energy storage</a> available, and, as of March 2012, the <a href="/wiki/Electric_Power_Research_Institute" title="Electric Power Research Institute">Electric Power Research Institute</a> (EPRI) reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a>. PSH reported <a href="/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency" title="Energy conversion efficiency">energy efficiency</a> varies in practice between 70% and 80%, with claims of up to 87%.</p>
<p>At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir. When demand grows, water is released back into a lower reservoir (or waterway or body of water) through a <a href="/wiki/Turbine" title="Turbine">turbine</a>, generating electricity. Reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine (usually a <a href="/wiki/Francis_turbine" title="Francis turbine">Francis turbine</a> design). Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies. Pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs, while the "pump-back" approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric plants</a> that use natural stream-flow.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage" title="Compressed air energy storage">Compressed air energy storage</a></div>
<p>Compressed air energy storage (CAES) uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation. Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives. The compressed air is stored in an underground reservoir.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gas_compressor" title="Gas compressor">Compression</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a> creates heat; the air is warmer after compression. <a href="/wiki/Thermal_expansion" title="Thermal expansion">Expansion</a> requires heat. If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, efficiency improves considerably. A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways. Air storage can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adiabatic" title="Adiabatic">adiabatic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diabatic" title="Diabatic">diabatic</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isothermal" title="Isothermal">isothermal</a>. Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Flywheel_energy_storage">Flywheel energy storage</span></h4>

<p>Flywheel energy storage (FES) works by accelerating a rotor (<a href="/wiki/Flywheel" title="Flywheel">flywheel</a>) to a very high speed, holding energy as <a href="/wiki/Rotational_energy" title="Rotational energy">rotational energy</a>. When energy is extracted, the flywheel's rotational speed declines as a consequence of <a href="/wiki/Conservation_of_energy" title="Conservation of energy">conservation of energy</a>; adding energy correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.</p>
<p>Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel, but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration.</p>
<p>FES systems have rotors made of high strength <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon-fiber" title="Carbon-fiber">carbon-fiber</a> composites, suspended by <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_bearing" title="Magnetic bearing">magnetic bearings</a> and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure. Such flywheels can reach maximum speed ("charge") in a matter of minutes. The flywheel system is connected to a combination <a href="/wiki/Electric_motor" title="Electric motor">electric motor</a>/<a href="/wiki/Electric_generator" title="Electric generator">generator</a>.</p>

<p>FES systems have relatively long lifetimes (lasting decades with little or no maintenance; full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 10, up to 10, cycles of use), high <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a> (100–130 W·h/kg, or 360–500 kJ/kg) and <a href="/wiki/Power_density" title="Power density">power density</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravitational_potential_energy_storage_with_solid_masses">Gravitational potential energy storage with solid masses</span></h4>
<p>Changing the altitude of solid masses can store or release energy via an elevating system driven by an electric motor/generator.</p>
<p>Companies such as Energy Cache and Advanced Rail Energy Storage (ARES) are working on this. ARES uses rails to move concrete weights up and down. Stratosolar proposes to use winches supported by buoyant platforms at an altitude of 20 kilometers, to raise and lower solid masses. Sink Float Solutions proposes to use winches supported by an ocean barge for taking advantage of a 4 km (13,000 ft) elevation difference between the surface and the seabed. ARES estimated a capital cost for the storage capacity of around 60% of pump storage hydroelectricity, Stratosolar $100/kWh and Sink Float Solutions $25/kWh (4000 m depth) and $50/kWh (with 2000 m depth).</p>
<p>Potential energy storage or gravity energy storage was under active development in 2013 in association with the <a href="/wiki/California_Independent_System_Operator" title="California Independent System Operator">California Independent System Operator</a>. It examined the movement of earth-filled <a href="/wiki/Hopper_car" title="Hopper car">hopper rail cars</a> driven by <a href="/wiki/Electric_locomotive" title="Electric locomotive">electric locomotives</a>) from lower to higher elevations.</p>
<p>ARES claimed advantages including indefinite storage with no energy losses, low costs when earth/rocks are used and conservation of water resources.</p>

<p>Thermal storage is the temporary storage or removal of heat. TES is practical because of water's large <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_of_fusion" title="Heat of fusion">heat of fusion</a>: the melting of one <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metric_ton" title="Metric ton">metric ton</a> of ice (approximately one cubic metre in size) can capture 334 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megajoule" title="Megajoule">megajoules</a> [MJ] (317,000 <a href="/wiki/British_thermal_unit" title="British thermal unit">BTU</a>) of thermal energy.</p>
<p>An example is Alberta, Canada's <a href="/wiki/Drake_Landing_Solar_Community" title="Drake Landing Solar Community">Drake Landing Solar Community</a><i>,</i> for which 97% of the year-round heat is provided by solar-thermal collectors on the garage roofs, with a borehole thermal energy store (BTES) being the enabling technology. STES projects often have paybacks in the four-to-six year range. In Braestrup, Denmark, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Denmark" title="Solar power in Denmark">the community's solar district heating system</a> also utilizes STES, at a storage temperature of 65 °C (149 °F). A heat pump, which is run only when there is surplus wind power available on the national grid, is used to raise the temperature to 80 °C (176 °F) for distribution. When surplus wind generated electricity is not available, a gas-fired boiler is used. Twenty percent of Braestrup's heat is solar.</p>

<p>Latent heat thermal energy storage systems works with materials with high latent heat (heat of fusion) capacity, known as <a href="/wiki/Phase-change_material" title="Phase-change material">phase change materials</a> (PCMs). The main advantage of these materials is that their latent heat storage capacity is much more than sensible heat. In a specific temperature range, phase changes from solid to liquid absorbs a large amount of thermal energy for later use.</p>

<p>Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery" title="Rechargeable battery">rechargeable batteries</a>. They store the most energy per unit volume or mass (<a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a>) among capacitors.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/UltraBattery" title="UltraBattery">UltraBattery</a> is a hybrid lead-acid cell and carbon-based <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ultracapacitor" title="Ultracapacitor">ultracapacitor</a> (or supercapacitor) invented by Australia’s national research body, the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" title="Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO). The lead-acid cell and ultracapacitor share the sulfuric acid electrolyte and both are packaged into the same physical unit. The UltraBattery can be manufactured with similar physical and electrical characteristics to conventional lead-acid batteries making it possible to cost-effectively replace many lead-acid applications.</p>
<p>The UltraBattery tolerates high charge and discharge levels and endures large numbers of cycles, outperforming previous lead-acid cells by more than an order of magnitude. In hybrid-electric vehicle tests, millions of cycles have been achieved. The UltraBattery is also highly tolerant to the effects of sulfation compared with traditional lead-acid cells. This means it can operate continuously in partial state of charge whereas traditional lead-acid batteries are generally held at full charge between discharge events. It is generally electrically inefficient to fully charge a lead-acid battery so by decreasing time spent in the top region of charge the UltraBattery achieves high efficiencies, typically between 85 and 95% DC-DC.</p>
<p>The UltraBattery can work across a wide range of applications. The constant cycling and fast charging and discharging necessary for applications such as grid regulation and leveling and electric vehicles can damage chemical batteries, but are well handled by the ultracapacitive qualities of UltraBattery technology. The technology has been installed in Australia and the US on the megawatt scale, performing frequency regulation and renewable smoothing applications.</p>

<p>At penetrations below 20% of the grid demand, renewables do not severely change the economics; but beyond about 20% of the total demand, external storage becomes important. If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen, they can be freely expanded. A 5-year community-based pilot program using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_turbines" title="Wind turbines">wind turbines</a> and hydrogen generators began in 2007 in the remote community of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ramea,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Ramea, Newfoundland and Labrador">Ramea, Newfoundland and Labrador</a>. A similar project began in 2004 on <a href="/wiki/Utsira" title="Utsira">Utsira</a>, a small Norwegian island.</p>
<p>Energy losses involved in the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_storage" title="Hydrogen storage">hydrogen storage</a> cycle come from the <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water" title="Electrolysis of water">electrolysis of water</a>, liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity.</p>
<p>About 50 kW·h (180 MJ) of solar energy is required to produce a kilogram of hydrogen, so the cost of the electricity is crucial. At $0.03/kWh, a common off-peak high-voltage line rate in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, hydrogen costs $1.50 a kilogram for the electricity, equivalent to $1.50/gallon for <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">Methane</a> is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula CH<sub>4</sub>. Methane is more easily stored than hydrogen and the transportation. Storage and combustion infrastructure (pipelines, <a href="/wiki/Gas_holder" title="Gas holder">gasometers</a>, power plants) are mature.</p>
<p>Synthetic natural gas (<a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a> or SNG) can be created in a multi-step process, starting with hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is then reacted with <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Sabatier_reaction" title="Sabatier reaction">Sabatier process</a>, producing methane and water. Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity. The resulting water is recycled, reducing the need for water. In the electrolysis stage oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant, eliminating <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" title="Nitrogen oxide">nitrogen oxides</a>.</p>
<p>Methane combustion produces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water. The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis. Methane production, storage and combustion recycles the reaction products.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector, not a cost as in <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Renewable_energy_storage">Renewable energy storage</span></h4>


<p>The largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams. A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons. A very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years. While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources, it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind. If wind or solar generation exceeds the regions hydroelectric capacity, then some additional source of energy will be needed.</p>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources (notably solar and wind) produce <a href="/wiki/Variable_renewable_energy" title="Variable renewable energy">variable power</a>. Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes. Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms.</p>
<p>The main method of electrical grid storage is <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage hydroelectricity</a>. Areas of the world such as Norway, Wales, Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoirs</a>, using electrically powered pumps to fill them. When needed, the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity. Pumped storage in Norway, which gets almost all its electricity from hydro, has an instantaneous capacity of 25–30 GW expandable to 60 GW—enough to be "Europe's battery".</p>

Under central control, home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in <a href="/wiki/Storage_heater" title="Storage heater">special space heaters</a> to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified <a href="/wiki/Storage_water_heater" title="Storage water heater">hot water heater tanks</a>. After charging, the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed. The experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down, or in the case of a nuclear power plant, reduced to its lowest possible operating level, leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ice_storage_air_conditioning" title="Ice storage air conditioning">Ice storage air conditioning</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage" title="Thermal energy storage">thermal energy storage</a> (TES) can be used for <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioning" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a>. It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and/or groups of smaller buildings. Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads. In 2009, thermal storage was used in over 3,300 buildings in over 35 countries. It works by creating ice at night and using the ice to for cooling during the hotter daytime periods.</p>
<p>The most popular technique is <a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage#Air_conditioning" title="Thermal energy storage">ice storage</a>, which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chiller's daytime output.</p>
<p>A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day. At night, they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water. Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water. Such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day. Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 - 50% of the size needed for a conventional, no-storage design. Storage sufficient to store half a day's available heat is usually adequate.</p>
<p>A full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours. Capital costs are higher, as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system.</p>
<p>This ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower. Off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs. The U.S. <a href="/wiki/Green_Building_Council" title="Green Building Council">Green Building Council</a> has developed the <a href="/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" title="Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings. Off-peak cooling may help toward LEED Certification.</p>
<p>Thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling. An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night.</p>
<p>Latent heat can also be stored in technical <a href="/wiki/Phase-change_material" title="Phase-change material">phase change materials</a> (PCMs). These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels, to moderate room temperatures.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h2>
<p>The economics of Energy Storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested, and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of Energy Storage. Therefore not every Energy Storage is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several MWh, and the optimal size of the Energy Storage is market and location dependent. </p>
<p>Moreover, ESS are affected by several risks, e.g.:</p>
<p>1) techno-economic risks, which are related to the specific technology;</p>
<p>2) Market risks, which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system;</p>
<p>3) Regulation and policy risks.</p>
<p>Therefore, traditional techniques based on deterministic <a href="/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow" title="Discounted cash flow">Discounted Cash Flow</a> (DCF) for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investor’s flexibility to deal with them. Hence, the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the Real Option Analysis (ROA), which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts.</p>
<p>The economic valuation of large-scale applications (including pumped hydro storage and compressed air) considers benefits including: wind curtailment avoidance, grid congestion avoidance, price arbitrage and carbon free energy delivery. In one technical assessment by the <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre</a>, economic goals could be met with batteries if energy storage were achievable at a capital cost of $30 to $50 per kilowatt-hour of storage capacity.</p>
<p>A metric for calculating the energy efficiency of storage systems is Energy Storage On Energy Invested (ESOI) which is the useful energy used to make the storage system divided into the lifetime energy storage. For lithium ion batteries this is around 10, and for lead acid batteries it is about 2. Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI, such as 210.</p>
