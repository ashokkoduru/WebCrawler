<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1990s">1990s</span></h3>
<p>Merger talks between <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation" title="Lockheed Corporation">Lockheed Corporation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Martin_Marietta" title="Martin Marietta">Martin Marietta</a> began in March 1994, with the companies announcing their $10 billion planned merger on August 30, 1994. The deal was finalized on March 15, 1995, when the two companies' shareholders approved the merger. The segments of the two companies not retained by the new company formed the basis for the present <a href="/wiki/L-3_Communications" title="L-3 Communications">L-3 Communications</a>, a mid-size defense contractor in its own right. Lockheed Martin also later spun off the materials company <a href="/wiki/Martin_Marietta_Materials" title="Martin Marietta Materials">Martin Marietta Materials</a>.</p>
<p>Both companies contributed important products to the new portfolio. Lockheed products included the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trident_missile" title="Trident missile">Trident missile</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/P-3_Orion" title="P-3 Orion">P-3 Orion</a>, <a href="/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon" title="General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-22_Raptor" title="F-22 Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/C-130_Hercules" title="C-130 Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A-4AR_Fightinghawk" title="A-4AR Fightinghawk">A-4AR Fightinghawk</a> and the DSCS-3 satellite.

<p>Lockheed Martin abandoned plans for a $8.3 billion merger with <a href="/wiki/Northrop_Grumman" title="Northrop Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a> on July 16, 1998, due to government concerns over the potential strength of the new group; Lockheed/Northrop would have had control of 25% of the Department of Defense's procurement budget.</p>
<p>For the <a href="/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter" title="Mars Climate Orbiter">Mars Climate Orbiter</a>, Lockheed Martin incorrectly provided NASA with software using measurements in <a href="/wiki/United_States_customary_units" title="United States customary units">US Customary force units</a> when metric was expected; this resulted in the loss of the Orbiter at a cost of $125 million.

I want them to do the things that will build a better relationship. I'm not getting all that love yet."

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Management">Management</span></h2>
<p>Senior management consists of the CEO, COO and CFO, and Executive Vice Presidents (EVP) of five business areas. The EVPs are responsible for managing major programs.</p>
<p>Employees in each program are organized into four tiers: Tier1 –Program Manager/VP, Tier2-Functional Teams (Finance, Chief Engineer, Quality, Operations, etc.), Tier3-Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) (Weapon System Development, Weapon System Integration, etc.), and Tier4-detailed product development. Floor or touch workers belong to component assembly teams. Lockheed Martin manages and maintains its relationship with these touch workers through its supervisors and unions.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin manages employees through its Full Spectrum Leadership and LM21 programs. The LM21 program relies on <a href="/wiki/Six_Sigma" title="Six Sigma">Six Sigma</a> principles, which are techniques to improve efficiency. Senior management constructs leadership councils and assigns managers to facilitate <a href="/wiki/Kaizen" title="Kaizen">Kaizen</a> events, which target specific processes for improvement. A manager facilitates teams and processes stakeholders and suppliers to streamline process implementation.</p>
<p>Tier2 Functional Leads and Tier3 IPT Leads report to Tier1. IPT leads are responsible for entire systems or products defined by the contract’s Statement of Work.</p>
<p>To control quality, Lockheed Martin trains and builds IPT teams. and ensures that work is executed correctly through a Technical Performance Measure (TPM) system which emphasizes its Lean and 6 Sigma processes.

<p>Floor employees assemble aircraft using Flow-to-<a href="/wiki/Takt_time" title="Takt time">takt</a> lean manufacturing process which uses properties from both division of labor and scientific management. By separating tasks based on parts, Lockheed Martin utilizes the division of labor theory, specialization on a specific area creates efficiency.</p>
