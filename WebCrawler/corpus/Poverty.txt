<p><b>Poverty</b> is general scarcity or the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money. It is a multifaceted concept, which includes social, economic, and political elements. <a href="/wiki/Extreme_poverty" title="Extreme poverty">Absolute poverty</a> or <b>destitution</b> refers to the lack of means necessary to meet basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter. Absolute poverty is meant to be about the same independent of location. Relative poverty occurs when people do not enjoy a certain minimum level of living standards as compared to the rest of society and so would vary from country to country, sometimes within the same country.</p>

<p>The World Bank forecasts that <a href="/wiki/Global_Monitoring_Report_(World_Bank)" title="Global Monitoring Report (World Bank)">702.1 million people</a> , down from 1.75 billion in 1990. Of these, about 347.1 million people lived in <a href="/wiki/Global_Monitoring_Report_(World_Bank)" title="Global Monitoring Report (World Bank)">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> (35.2% of the population) and 231.3 million lived in <a href="/wiki/Global_Monitoring_Report_(World_Bank)" title="Global Monitoring Report (World Bank)">South Asia</a> (13.5% of the population). According to the World Bank, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of the world's population living in extreme poverty fell from 37.1% to 9.6%, falling below 10% for the first time. Nevertheless, given the current economic model, built on <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a>, it would take 100 years to bring the world's poorest up to the previous poverty line of $1.25 a day. Extreme poverty is a global challenge; it is observed in all parts of the world, including developed economies. <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> estimates half the world's children (or 1.1 billion) live in poverty. It has been argued by some academics that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neoliberal" title="Neoliberal">neoliberal</a> policies promoted by global financial institutions such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">IMF</a> and the World Bank are actually exacerbating both inequality and poverty.</p>
<p>Another estimate places the true scale of poverty much higher than the World Bank, with an estimated 4.3 billion people (59 percent of the world's population) living with less than $5 a day and unable to meet basic needs adequately.</p>
<p>In 2012 it is estimated that, given a poverty line of $1.25 a day 1.2 billion people lived in poverty.</p>

<p>Income Poverty: a family's income fails to meet a federally established threshold that differs across countries.</p>




<p><a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>: Fundamentally, poverty is the inability of having choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one’s food or a job to earn one’s living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>: Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being, and comprises many <a href="/wiki/Dimension" title="Dimension">dimensions</a>. It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for <a href="/wiki/Survival_skills" title="Survival skills">survival</a> with dignity. Poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one’s life. </p>
<p>Poverty is usually measured as either <a href="/wiki/Extreme_poverty" title="Extreme poverty">absolute</a> or <a href="/wiki/Relative_deprivation" title="Relative deprivation">relative</a> (the latter being actually an index of <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">income inequality</a>).</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Cameron_ministry" title="Second Cameron ministry">second Cameron ministry</a> came under attack for their redefinition of poverty; poverty is no longer classified by a family's income, but as to whether a family is in work or not. Considering that two-thirds of people who found work were accepting wages that are below the living wage (according to the <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Rowntree_Foundation" title="Joseph Rowntree Foundation">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>) this has been criticised by anti-poverty campaigners as an unrealistic view of poverty in the United Kingdom.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Extreme_poverty" title="Extreme poverty">Extreme poverty</a></div>
<p>Absolute poverty refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. First introduced in 1990, the dollar a day <a href="/wiki/Poverty_threshold" title="Poverty threshold">poverty line</a> measured absolute poverty by the standards of the world’s poorest countries. The <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> defined the new international poverty line as $1.25 a day in 2008 for 2005 (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices). In October 2015, they reset it to $1.90 a day.</p>
<p>Absolute poverty, <a href="/wiki/Extreme_poverty" title="Extreme poverty">extreme poverty</a>, or abject poverty is "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services." The term 'absolute poverty', when used in this fashion, is usually synonymous with 'extreme poverty': <a href="/wiki/Robert_McNamara" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>, the former president of the World Bank, described absolute or extreme poverty as, "a condition so limited by <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Illiteracy" title="Illiteracy">illiteracy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Disease" title="Disease">disease</a>, squalid surroundings, high <a href="/wiki/Infant_mortality" title="Infant mortality">infant mortality</a>, and low <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> as to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency." Australia is one of the world's wealthier nations. In his article published in Australian Policy Online, Robert Tanton notes that, "While this amount is appropriate for third world countries, in Australia, the amount required to meet these basic needs will naturally be much higher because prices of these basic necessities are higher."</p>
<p>However, as the amount of wealth required for survival is not the same in all places and time periods, particularly in highly developed countries where few people would fall below the World Bank Group's poverty lines, countries often develop their own national poverty lines.</p>
<p>An absolute poverty line was calculated in Australia for the Henderson poverty inquiry in 1973. It was $62.70 a week, which was the disposable income required to support the basic needs of a family of two adults and two dependent children at the time. This poverty line has been updated regularly by the Melbourne Institute according to increases in average incomes; for a single employed person it was $391.85 per week (including housing costs) in March 2009. In Australia the OECD poverty would equate to a "disposable income of less than $358 per week for a single adult (higher for larger households to take account of their greater costs). in 2015 Australia implemented the <a href="/wiki/Individual_Deprivation_Measure" title="Individual Deprivation Measure">Individual Deprivation Measure</a> which address gender disparities in poverty.</p>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power" title="Purchasing power">Purchasing power</a></div>
<p>For a few years starting 1990, the World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and through 2005, absolute poverty was $1.08 a day for all countries on a <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a> basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 U.S. dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living. In 2015, the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank_Group" title="World Bank Group">World Bank</a> defines <a href="/wiki/Extreme_poverty" title="Extreme poverty">extreme poverty</a> as living on less than US$1.90 (<a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">PPP</a>) per day, and <i>moderate poverty</i> as less than $2 or $5 a day (but note that a person or family with access to subsistence resources, e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsistence_farmers" title="Subsistence farmers">subsistence farmers</a>, may have a low cash income without a correspondingly low standard of living – they are not living "on" their cash income but using it as a top up). It estimated that "in 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day." A 'dollar a day', in nations that do not use the U.S. dollar as currency, does not translate to living a day on the equivalent amount of local currency as determined by the <a href="/wiki/Exchange_rate" title="Exchange rate">exchange rate</a>. Rather, it is determined by the <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a> rate, which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same things that a dollar could buy in the United States. Usually, this would translate to less local currency than the exchange rate in poorer countries as the United States is a relatively more expensive country.</p>
<p>The poverty line threshold of $1.90 per day, as set by the World Bank, is controversial. Each nation has its own threshold for absolute poverty line; in the United Sta</p>

<p>tes, for example, the absolute poverty line was US$15.15 per day in 2010 (US$22,000 per year for a family of four), while in India it was US$1.0 per day and in China the absolute poverty line was US$0.55 per day, each on PPP basis in 2010. These different poverty lines make data comparison between each nation's official reports qualitatively difficult. Some scholars argue that the World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is low. Still others suggest that poverty line misleads as it measures everyone below the poverty line the same, when in reality someone living on $1.20 per day is in a different state of poverty than someone living on $0.20 per day. In other words, the depth and intensity of poverty varies across the world and in any regional populations, and $1.25 per day poverty line and head counts are inadequate measures.</p>
<p>The share of the world's population living in absolute poverty fell from 43% in 1981 to 14% in 2011. The absolute number of people in poverty fell from 1.95 billion in 1981 to 1.01 billion in 2011. The economist <a href="/wiki/Max_Roser" title="Max Roser">Max Roser</a> estimates that the number of people in poverty is therefore roughly the same as 200 years ago. This is the case since the world population was just little more than 1 billion in 1820 and the majority (84% to 94%) of the world population was living poverty. The proportion of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_world" title="Developing world">developing world</a>'s population living in extreme economic poverty fell from 28 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2001. Most of this improvement has occurred in <a href="/wiki/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East</a> and South Asia. In East Asia the World Bank reported that "The poverty headcount rate at the $2-a-day level is estimated to have fallen to about 27 percent [in 2007], down from 29.5 percent in 2006 and 69 percent in 1990." In <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> extreme poverty went up from 41 percent in 1981 to 46 percent in 2001, which combined with growing population increased the number of people living in extreme poverty from 231 million to 318 million.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s some of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia experienced a sharp drop in income. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Collapse of the Soviet Union">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> resulted in large declines in GDP per capita, of about 30 to 35% between 1990 and the trough year of 1998 (when it was at its minimum). As a result, poverty rates also increased although in subsequent years as per capita incomes recovered the poverty rate dropped from 31.4% of the population to 19.6%.</p>
<p>World Bank data shows that the percentage of the population living in households with consumption or income per person below the poverty line has decreased in each region of the world since 1990:</p>


<p>According to Chen and Ravallion, about 1.76 billion people in developing world lived <i>above</i> $1.25 per day and 1.9 billion people lived <i>below</i> $1.25 per day in 1981. The world's population increased over the next 25 years. In 2005, about 4.09 billion people in developing world lived above $1.25 per day and 1.4 billion people lived below $1.25 per day (both 1981 and 2005 data are on inflation adjusted basis). Some scholars caution that these trends are subject to various assumptions and not certain. Additionally, they note that the poverty reduction is not uniform across the world; economically prospering countries such as China, India and Brazil have made more progress in absolute poverty reduction than countries in other regions of the world.</p>
<p>The absolute poverty measure trends noted above are supported by human development indicators, which have also been improving. <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">Life expectancy</a> has greatly increased in the developing world since World War II and is starting to close the gap to the developed world. <a href="/wiki/Child_mortality" title="Child mortality">Child mortality</a> has decreased in every developing region of the world. The proportion of the world's population living in countries where per-capita food supplies are less than 2,200 calories (9,200 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilojoule" title="Kilojoule">kilojoules</a>) per day decreased from 56% in the mid-1960s to below 10% by the 1990s. Similar trends can be observed for literacy, access to clean water and electricity and basic consumer items.</p>

<p>Relative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_context" title="Social context">social context</a>, hence relative poverty is a measure of income inequality. Usually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of the population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. There are several other different <a href="/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics" title="Income inequality metrics">income inequality metrics</a>, for example, the <a href="/wiki/Gini_coefficient" title="Gini coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> or the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theil_Index" title="Theil Index">Theil Index</a>.</p>
<p>Relative poverty is the "most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations." Relative poverty measure is used by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Program" title="United Nations Development Program">United Nations Development Program</a> (UNDP), the <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">United Nations Children’s Fund</a> (UNICEF), the <a href="/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD) and Canadian poverty researchers. In the European Union, the "relative poverty measure is the most prominent and most–quoted of the EU social inclusion indicators."</p>
<p>"Relative poverty reflects better the cost of social inclusion and equality of opportunity in a specific time and space."</p>
<p>"Once economic development has progressed beyond a certain minimum level, the rub of the poverty problem – from the point of view of both the poor individual and of the societies in which they live – is not so much the effects of poverty in any absolute form but the effects of the contrast, daily perceived, between the lives of the poor and the lives of those around them. For practical purposes, the problem of poverty in the industrialized nations today is a problem of relative poverty (page 9)."</p>
<p>In 1776 Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations argued that poverty is the inability to afford, "not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without."</p>
<p>In 1958 <a href="/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith" title="John Kenneth Galbraith">J. K. Galbraith</a> argued that "People are poverty stricken when their income, even if adequate for survival, falls markedly behind that of their community."</p>
<p>In 1964 in a joint committee economic President's report in the United States, Republicans endorsed the concept of relative poverty. "No objective definition of poverty exists... The definition varies from place to place and time to time. In America as our standard of living rises, so does our idea of what is substandard."</p>
<p>In 1965 <a href="/wiki/Rose_Friedman" title="Rose Friedman">Rose Friedman</a> argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards. Those labeled as poor in 1995 would have had "a higher standard of living than many labeled not poor" in 1965.</p>
<p>In 1979, British sociologist, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Townsend_(sociologist)" title="Peter Townsend (sociologist)">Peter Townsend</a> published his famous definition, "individuals [...] can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary, or are at least widely encouraged or approved, in the societies to which they belong (page 31).". This definition and measurement of poverty was profoundly linked to the idea that poverty and societal participation are deeply associated.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Peter_Townsend_(sociologist)" title="Peter Townsend (sociologist)">Peter Townsend</a> transformed the conception of poverty, viewing it not simply as lack of income but as the configuration of the economic conditions that prevent people from being full members of the society (Townsend, 1979; Ferragina et al. 2016 ). Poverty reduces the ability of people to participate in society, effectively denying them full citizenship (as suggested by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/T.H._Marshall" title="T.H. Marshall">T.H. Marshall</a>). Given that there are no universal principles by which to determine the minimum threshold of participation equating to full membership of society, Townsend argued that the appropriate measure would necessarily be relative to any particular cultural context. He suggested that in each society there should be an empirically determinable ‘breakpoint’ within the income distribution below which participation of individuals collapses, providing a scientific basis for fixing a poverty line and determining the extent of poverty (Ferragina et al. 2016 ).</p>
<p>Brian Nolan and Christopher T. Whelan of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Ireland explained that "[P]overty has to be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question."</p>
<p>Relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates by the European Union, UNICEF, and the OEDC. The main poverty line used in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> is based on "economic distance", a level of income set at 60% of the median household income.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_aspects">Other aspects</span></h3>
<p>Economic aspects of poverty focus on material needs, typically including the necessities of daily living, such as food, clothing, shelter, or safe drinking water. Poverty in this sense may be understood as a condition in which a person or community is lacking in the basic needs for a minimum standard of well-being and life, particularly as a result of a persistent lack of income. The increase in poverty runs parallel sides with unemployment, hunger, and higher crime rate.</p>
<p>Analysis of social aspects of poverty links conditions of scarcity to aspects of the distribution of resources and power in a society and recognizes that poverty may be a function of the diminished "capability" of people to live the kinds of lives they value. The social aspects of poverty may include lack of <a href="/wiki/Information_access" title="Information access">access to information</a>, <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Health_care" title="Health care">health care</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Political_power" title="Political power">political power</a>.</p>
<p>Poverty levels are snapshot pictures in time that omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply additional information about the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen-year period (1975 to 1991 in the U.S.) only 5% of those in the lower fifth of the income level were still at that level, while 95% transitioned to a higher income category. Poverty levels can remain the same while those who rise out of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine-year period ending in 2005 for the U.S., 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.</p>
<p>Poverty may also be understood as an aspect of unequal <a href="/wiki/Social_status" title="Social status">social status</a> and inequitable social relationships, experienced as social exclusion, dependency, and diminished capacity to participate, or to develop meaningful connections with other people in society. Such social exclusion can be minimized through strengthened connections with the mainstream, such as through the provision of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Relational_care" title="Relational care">relational care</a> to those who are experiencing poverty.</p>

<p>The World Bank's "Voices of the Poor," based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors which poor people identify as part of poverty. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abuse by those in power</li>
<li>Dis-empowering institutions</li>
<li>Excluded locations</li>
<li>Gender relationships</li>
<li>Lack of security</li>
<li>Limited capabilities</li>
<li>Physical limitations</li>
<li>Precarious livelihoods</li>
<li>Problems in social relationships</li>
<li>Weak community organizations</li>
<li>Discrimination</li>
</ul>
<p>David Moore, in his book <i>The World Bank</i>, argues that some analysis of poverty reflect pejorative, sometimes racial, stereotypes of impoverished people as powerless victims and passive recipients of aid programs.</p>
<p>Ultra-poverty, a term apparently coined by Michael Lipton, connotes being amongst poorest of the poor in low-income countries. Lipton defined ultra-poverty as receiving less than 80 percent of minimum caloric intake whilst spending more than 80% of income on food. Alternatively a 2007 report issued by International Food Policy Research Institute defined ultra-poverty as living on less than 54 cents per day.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Asset_poverty" title="Asset poverty">Asset poverty</a> is an economic and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty. It can be defined as a household’s inability to access wealth resources that are sufficient enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, <a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cultural_capital" title="Cultural capital">cultural capital</a>, <a href="/wiki/Political_capital" title="Political capital">political capital</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a>.</p>

<p>A pair of studies of the influence of poverty on the ability to reason about complicated issues requiring an immediate solution found that poverty directly impedes cognitive function.

<p>Research has found that there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions of which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an urban war zone is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even war-like conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior. Because of poverty, "Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out"</p>
<p>For children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to others such as <a href="/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency" title="Juvenile delinquency">juvenile delinquency</a> rates, higher levels of <a href="/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy" title="Teenage pregnancy">teenage pregnancy</a>, and the economic dependency upon their low-income parent or parents. Families and society who submit low levels of investment in the education and development of less fortunate children end up with less favorable results for the children who see a life of parental employment reduction and low wages. Higher rates of early <a href="/wiki/Pregnancy" title="Pregnancy">childbearing</a> with all the connected risks to family, health and well-being are major important issues to address since education from preschool to high school are both identifiably meaningful in a life.</p>
<p>Poverty often drastically affects children's success in school. A child's "home activities, preferences, mannerisms" must align with the world and in the cases that they do not do these, students are at a disadvantage in the school and, most importantly, the classroom. Therefore, it is safe to state that children who live at or below the poverty level will have far less success educationally than children who live above the poverty line. Poor children have a great deal less healthcare and this ultimately results in many absences from the academic year. Additionally, poor children are much more likely to suffer from hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear infections, flu, and colds. These illnesses could potentially restrict a child or student's focus and concentration.</p>
<p>For a child to grow up emotionally healthy, the children under three need "A strong, reliable primary caregiver who provides consistent and unconditional love, guidance, and support. Safe, predictable, stable environments. Ten to 20 hours each week of harmonious, reciprocal interactions. This process, known as attunement, is most crucial during the first 6–24 months of infants' lives and helps them develop a wider range of healthy emotions, including gratitude, forgiveness, and empathy. Enrichment through personalized, increasingly complex activities".</p>
<p>Harmful spending habits mean that the poor typically spend about 2 percent of their income educating their children but larger percentages of alcohol and tobacco (For example, 6 percent in Indonesia and 8 percent in Mexico).</p>

<p>Poverty has been also considered a real social phenomenon reflecting more the consequences of a lack of income than the lack of income per <i>se</i> (Ferragina et al. 2016  ). According to Townsend: humans are social animals entangled in a web of relationships, which exert complex and changing pressures, as much in their consumption of goods and services as in any other aspect of their behaviour (Townsend 1979 ). This idea has received theoretical support from scholars and extensive testimony from people experiencing poverty across the globe (Walker 2014 ). Participation and consumption have become ever more crucial mechanisms through which people establish and communicate their identity and position in society, increasing the premium attached to resources needed to participate (Giddens 1991 ). In addition, the concept of social exclusion has been added to the lexicon of poverty related terms, describing the process by which people, especially those on low incomes, can become socially and politically detached from mainstream society and its associated resources and opportunities (Cantillon 1997 ). Equally western society have become more complex with ethnic diversity, multi-culturalism and life-style choices raising the possibility that a single concept of poverty as conceived in the past might no longer apply (Ferragina et al. 2016 ).</p>

<p>Poverty increases the risk of <a href="/wiki/Homelessness" title="Homelessness">homelessness</a>. Slum-dwellers, who make up a third of the world's urban population, live in a poverty no better, if not worse, than rural people, who are the traditional focus of the poverty in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_world" title="Developing world">developing world</a>, according to a report by the United Nations.</p>
<p>There are over 100 million <a href="/wiki/Street_children" title="Street children">street children</a> worldwide. Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children's <a href="/wiki/Child_development" title="Child development">development</a> by separating them from their families and that it would be more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Utilities">Utilities</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_and_sanitation">Water and sanitation</span></h4>
<p>As of 2012, 2.5 billion people lack access to sanitation services and 15% practice <a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">open defecation</a>. Water utility subsidies tend to subsidize water consumption by those connected to the supply grid, which is typically skewed towards the richer and urban segment of the population and those outside informal housing. As a result of heavy consumption subsidies, the price of water decreases to the extent that only 30%, on average, of the supplying costs in developing countries is covered. This results in a lack of incentive to maintain delivery systems, leading to losses from leaks annually that are enough for 200 million people. This also leads to a lack of incentive to invest in expanding the network, resulting in much of the poor population being unconnected to the network. Instead, the poor buy water from water vendors for, on average, about five to 16 times the metered price. However, subsidies for laying new connections to the network rather than for consumption have shown more promise for the poor.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Electricity">Electricity</span></h4>

<p>Similarly, the poorest fifth receive 0.1% of the world’s lighting but pay a fifth of total spending on light, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of their income. Indoor air pollution from burning fuels kills 2 million, with almost half the deaths from pneumonia in children under 5. Fuel from Bamboo burns more cleanly and also matures much faster than wood, thus also reducing deforestation. Additionally, using solar panels is promoted as being cheaper over the products' lifetime even if upfront costs are higher. Thus, payment schemes such as lend-to-own programs are promoted and up to 14% of <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenyan</a> households use solar as their primary energy source.</p>

<p>According to experts, many women become victims of trafficking, the most common form of which is <a href="/wiki/Survival_sex" title="Survival sex">prostitution</a>, as a means of survival and economic desperation. Deterioration of living conditions can often compel children to abandon school to contribute to the family income, putting them at risk of being exploited. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, a number of girls are turning to sex in return for food to survive because of the increasing poverty. According to studies, as poverty decreases there will be fewer and fewer instances of violence.</p>
<p>In one survey, 67% of children from disadvantaged <a href="/wiki/Inner_city" title="Inner city">inner cities</a> said they had witnessed a serious assault, and 33% reported witnessing a homicide. 51% of fifth graders from <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> (median income for a household: $27,133) have been found to be victims of violence, compared to 32% in Washington, DC (mean income for a household: $40,127).</p>

However, researchers have gathered evidence that suggest that values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement into and out of poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The <a href="/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_Study" title="Great Smoky Mountains Study">Great Smoky Mountains Study</a> was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income.

<p>Agricultural technologies such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogen_fertilizer" title="Nitrogen fertilizer">nitrogen fertilizers</a>, pesticides, new seed varieties and new irrigation methods have dramatically reduced food shortages in modern times by boosting yields past previous constraints.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce. Geoffrey Parker wrote that "In <a href="/wiki/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lyon" title="Lyon">Lyon</a>, two of the largest cities in <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">western Europe</a>, by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis." The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated mass absolute poverty in what is now considered the developed world. <a href="/wiki/Mass_production" title="Mass production">Mass production</a> of goods in places such as rapidly industrializing China has made what were once considered luxuries, such as vehicles and computers, inexpensive and thus accessible to many who were otherwise too poor to afford them.</p>
<p>Even with new products, such as better seeds, or greater volumes of them, such as industrial production, the poor still require access to these products. Improving <a href="/wiki/Road" title="Road">road</a> and transportation infrastructure helps solve this major bottleneck. In Africa, it costs more to move fertilizer from an African seaport 60 miles inland than to ship it from the United States to Africa because of sparse, low-quality roads, leading to fertilizer costs two to six times the world average. <a href="/wiki/Microfranchising" title="Microfranchising">Microfranchising</a> models such as door to door distributors who earn commission-based income or <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>'s successful distribution system are used to disseminate basic needs to remote areas for below market prices.</p>

<p>Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health.

Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive and educational measures have been made to disseminate what works, such as the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Consensus" title="Copenhagen Consensus">Copenhagen Consensus</a>. Cheap <a href="/wiki/Water_filter" title="Water filter">water filters</a> and promoting hand washing are some of the most cost effective health interventions and can cut <a href="/wiki/Child_mortality" title="Child mortality">deaths</a> from <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>.</p>
<p>Strategies to provide education cost effectively include <a href="/wiki/Deworming" title="Deworming">deworming</a> children, which costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from <a href="/wiki/Anemia" title="Anemia">anemia</a>, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by simply providing free <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sanitary_towel" title="Sanitary towel">sanitary towels</a>. <a href="/wiki/Food_fortification" title="Food fortification">Fortification</a> with <a href="/wiki/Micronutrient" title="Micronutrient">micronutrients</a> was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries%27_debt" title="Developing countries' debt">Developing countries' debt service</a> to banks and governments from richer countries can constrain government spending on the poor.

For example, the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In <a href="/wiki/Malawi" title="Malawi">Malawi</a>, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter. A major proportion of aid from donor nations is <a href="/wiki/Tied_aid" title="Tied aid">tied</a>, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. US law requires <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_aid" title="Food aid">food aid</a> be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Basic_income" title="Basic income">basic income</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Negative_income_tax" title="Negative income tax">negative income tax</a>) is a system of <a href="/wiki/Social_security" title="Social security">social security</a>, that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of money that is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sufficient" title="Sufficient">sufficient</a> to live on. Studies of large cash-transfer programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi show that the programs can be effective in increasing consumption, schooling, and nutrition, whether they are tied to such conditions or not. Proponents argue that a basic income is more economically efficient than a <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unemployment_benefit" title="Unemployment benefit">unemployment benefits</a>, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing <a href="/wiki/Deadweight_loss" title="Deadweight loss">losses in efficiency</a>. In 1968, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Samuelson" title="Paul Samuelson">Paul Samuelson</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith" title="John Kenneth Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a> and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce a system of income guarantees. Winners of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Economics" title="Nobel Prize in Economics">Nobel Prize in Economics</a>, with often diverse political convictions, who support a basic income include <a href="/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" title="Herbert A.

<p>Income grants are argued to be vastly more efficient in extending basic needs to the poor than <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsidies" title="Subsidies">subsidizing</a> supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that the money spent on in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India’s poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Congo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, while India is phasing out its fuel subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Additionally, in aid models, the <a href="/wiki/Famine_relief" title="Famine relief">famine relief</a> model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs.</p>

<p>Corruption often leads to many <a href="/wiki/Civil_service" title="Civil service">civil services</a> being treated by governments as employment agencies to loyal supporters and so it could mean going through 20 procedures, paying $2,696 in fees and waiting 82 business days to start a business, in Bolivia, while, in Canada, it takes two days, two registration procedures, and $280 to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises, where most jobs are created. Often, businesses have to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which is, in effect, a tax on business. Noted reductions in poverty in recent decades has occurred in China and <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> mostly as a result of the abandonment of <a href="/wiki/Collective_farming" title="Collective farming">collective farming</a> in China and the ending of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Central_planning" title="Central planning">central planning</a> model known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/License_Raj" title="License Raj">License Raj</a> in India.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> concludes that governments and feudal elites extending to the poor the right to the land that they live and use are 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. Although approaches varied, the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions costs were low.</p>
<p>Greater access to markets brings more income to the poor. <a href="/wiki/Road" title="Road">Road</a> infrastructure has a direct impact on poverty. Additionally, migration from poorer countries resulted in $328 billion sent from richer to poorer countries in 2010, more than double the $120 billion in official aid flows from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> members. In 2011, India got $52 billion from its <a href="/wiki/Diaspora" title="Diaspora">diaspora</a>, more than it took in <a href="/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment" title="Foreign direct investment">foreign direct investment</a>.</p>

<p>Microloans, made famous by the <a href="/wiki/Grameen_Bank" title="Grameen Bank">Grameen Bank</a>, is where small amounts of money are loaned to farmers or villages, mostly women, who can then obtain physical capital to increase their economic rewards.

<p>Those in poverty place overwhelming importance on having a safe place to save money, much more so than receiving loans. Additionally, a large part of <a href="/wiki/Microfinance" title="Microfinance">microfinance</a> loans are spent not on investments but on products that would usually be paid by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Checking_account" title="Checking account">checking</a> or <a href="/wiki/Savings_account" title="Savings account">savings account</a>.

<p>Poverty can also be reduced as an improved economic policy is developed by the governing authorities to facilitate a more equitable distribution of the nation's wealth. <a href="/wiki/Oxfam" title="Oxfam">Oxfam</a> has called for an international movement to end extreme wealth concentration as a significant step towards ameliorating global poverty. The group stated that the $240 billion added to the fortunes of the world's richest billionaires in 2012 was enough to end extreme poverty four times over. Oxfam argues that the "concentration of resources in the hands of the top 1% depresses economic activity and makes life harder for everyone else - particularly those at the bottom of the economic ladder." It has been reported that only 1% of the world population controls 50% of the wealth today, and the other 99% is having access to the remaining 50% only, and the gap has sharply increased in the recent past.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Antonio_Ocampo" title="José Antonio Ocampo">José Antonio Ocampo</a>, professor at Columbia University and former finance minister of Colombia, and Magdalena Sepúlveda Carmona, former UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, argue that global tax reform is integral to human development and fighting poverty, as corporate tax avoidance has disproportionately impacted those mired in poverty, noting that "the human impact is devastatingly real. When profits are shifted out, the tax revenues from those profits that could be available to fund healthcare, schools, water sanitation and other public goods vanish from the ledger, leaving women and men, boys and girls without pathways to a better future."</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Bottom_of_the_pyramid" title="Bottom of the pyramid">Bottom of the pyramid</a></div>

<p>The concept of business serving the world's poorest four billion or so people has been popular since CK Prahalad introduced the idea through his book <i>Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits</i> in 2004, among many business corporations and business schools. Kash Rangan, John Quelch, and other faculty members at the Global Poverty Project at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Business_School" title="Harvard Business School">Harvard Business School</a> "believe that in pursuing its own self-interest in opening and expanding the BoP market, business can make a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development." According to Rangan "For business, the bulk of emerging markets worldwide is at the bottom of the pyramid so it makes good business sense—not a sense of do-gooding—to go after it.". But in the view of Friedman <i>the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits</i> only, thus, it needs to be examined whether business in BoP markets is capable of achieving the dual objective of <i>making a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development</i>? Erik Simanis has reported that the model has a fatal flaw. According to Erik "Despite achieving healthy penetration rates of 5% to 10% in four test markets, for instance, Procter &amp; Gamble couldn’t generate a competitive return on its Pur water-purification powder after launching the product on a large scale in 2001...DuPont ran into similar problems with a venture piloted from 2006 to 2008 in Andhra Pradesh, India, by its subsidiary Solae, a global manufacturer of soy protein ... Because the high costs of doing business among the very poor demand a high contribution per transaction, companies must embrace the reality that high margins and price points aren’t just a top-of-the-pyramid phenomenon; they’re also a necessity for ensuring sustainable businesses at the bottom of the pyramid." Marc Gunther states that "The bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market leader, arguably, is Unilever ... Its signature BOP product is Pureit, a countertop water-purification system sold in India, Africa and Latin America. It's saving lives, but it's not making money for shareholders." This leaves the ideal of <i>eradicating poverty through profits</i> or with a <i>good business sense—not a sense of do-gooding</i> rather questionable.</p>

<p>A report published in 2013 by the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, with support from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_%26_Development_Knowledge_Network" title="Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network">Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network</a>, found that climate change was likely to hinder future attempts to reduce poverty. The report presented the likely impacts of present day, 2 °C and 4 °C warming on agricultural production, water resources, coastal ecosystems and cities across Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and South East Asia. The impacts of a temperature rise of 2 °C included: regular food shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa; shifting rain patterns in South Asia leaving some parts under water and others without enough water for power generation, irrigation or drinking; degradation and loss of reefs in South East Asia, resulting in reduced fish stocks; and coastal communities and cities more vulnerable to increasingly violent storms. In 2016, A UN report claimed that by 2030, an additional 122 million more people could be driven to extreme poverty because of climate change.</p>
<p>According to an Australian scientist Professor Frank Fenner, humans will not be able to survive the population explosion and “unbridled consumption,” and will become extinct, perhaps within a century, along with many other species. He believes the situation is irreversible, and it is too late because the effects we have had on Earth since industrialisation rivals any effects of ice ages or comet impacts. Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson calculated that Earth would lose half its higher life forms by 2100 if the current rate of human disruption continued. Many think that poverty is the cause of environmental degradation, while there are others who claim that rather the poor are the worst sufferers of environmental degradation caused by reckless exploitation of natural resources by the rich. A Delhi-based environment organisation, the Centre for Science and Environment, points out that if the poor world were to develop and consume in the same manner as the West to achieve the same living standards, “we would need two additional planet Earths to produce resources and absorb wastes.”, reports Anup Shah (2003). in his article <i>Poverty and the Environment</i> on Global Issues.</p>

<p>Among some individuals, poverty is considered a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be an essential element of <a href="/wiki/Nekkhamma" title="Nekkhamma">renunciation</a> in religions such as <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (only for monks, not for lay persons) and <a href="/wiki/Jainism" title="Jainism">Jainism</a>, whilst in Roman Catholicism it is one of the <a href="/wiki/Evangelical_counsels" title="Evangelical counsels">evangelical counsels</a>. The main aim of giving up things of the materialistic world is to withdraw oneself from sensual pleasures (as they are fake and temporary in some religions). This self-invited poverty (or giving up pleasures) is different from the one caused by economic imbalance.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Benedict_XVI" title="Benedict XVI">Benedict XVI</a> distinguished "poverty <i>chosen</i>" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and "poverty <i>to be fought</i>" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considered that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.</p>
<p>As it was indicated above the reduction of poverty results from <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a>, but also can result from <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" title="Solidarity">solidarity</a>.</p>

Argues that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute; (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of taxes, transfers, and state benefits; and (5) integrate the depth of poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of these criteria. This article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally, using the <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg_Income_Study" title="Luxembourg Income Study">Luxembourg Income Study</a>, it examines the empirical patterns with these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967 to 1997.
