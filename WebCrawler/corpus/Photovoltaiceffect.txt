<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p>The <b>photovoltaic effect</b> is the creation of <a href="/wiki/Voltage" title="Voltage">voltage</a> or <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" title="Electric current">electric current</a> in a material upon exposure to <a href="/wiki/Light" title="Light">light</a> and is a <a href="/wiki/Physical_property" title="Physical property">physical</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> phenomenon.</p>
<p>The photovoltaic effect is closely related to the <a href="/wiki/Photoelectric_effect" title="Photoelectric effect">photoelectric effect</a>. In either case, light is absorbed, causing excitation of an <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electron</a> or other <a href="/wiki/Charge_carrier" title="Charge carrier">charge carrier</a> to a higher-energy state. The main distinction is that the term <i>photoelectric effect</i> is now usually used when the electron is ejected out of the material (usually into a vacuum) and <i>photovoltaic effect</i> used when the excited charge carrier is still contained within the material. In either case, an <a href="/wiki/Electric_potential" title="Electric potential">electric potential</a> (or voltage) is produced by the separation of charges, and the light has to have a sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for excitation. The physical essence of the difference is usually that photoelectric emission separates the charges by <a href="/wiki/Ballistic_conduction" title="Ballistic conduction">ballistic conduction</a> and photovoltaic emission separates them by diffusion, but one should note that some "hot carrier" photovoltaic device concepts blur even this line of distinction.</p>
<p>The first demonstration of the photovoltaic effect in 1839 used an electrochemical cell, but the most familiar form of the photovoltaic effect in modern times though is in solid-state devices, mainly in <a href="/wiki/Photodiode" title="Photodiode">photodiodes</a>. When sunlight or other sufficiently energetic light is incident upon the photodiode, the electrons present in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valence_band" title="Valence band">valence band</a> absorb energy and, being excited, jump to the conduction band and become free. These excited electrons diffuse, and some reach the rectifying junction (usually a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/P-n_junction" title="P-n junction">p-n junction</a>) where they are accelerated into a different material by a built-in potential (<a href="/wiki/Galvani_potential" title="Galvani potential">Galvani potential</a>). This generates an <a href="/wiki/Electromotive_force" title="Electromotive force">electromotive force</a>, and thus some of the light energy is converted into electric energy. The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called <a href="/wiki/Two-photon_photovoltaic_effect" title="Two-photon photovoltaic effect">two-photon photovoltaic effect</a>.</p>
<p>The photovoltaic effect was first observed by French physicist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A._E._Becquerel" title="A. E. Becquerel">A. E. Becquerel</a> in 1839. He explained his discovery in <i><a href="/wiki/Comptes_rendus_de_l%27Acad%C3%A9mie_des_sciences" title="Comptes rendus de l'AcadÃ©mie des sciences">Les Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences</a></i>, "the production of an electric current when two plates of platinum or gold immersed in an acid, neutral, or alkaline solution are exposed in an uneven way to solar radiation."</p>
<p>Besides the direct excitation of free electrons, a photovoltaic effect can also arise simply due to the heating caused by absorption of the light. The heating leads to an increase in temperature, which is accompanied by temperature gradients. These thermal gradients in turn may generate a voltage through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seebeck_effect" title="Seebeck effect">Seebeck effect</a>. Whether direct excitation or thermal effects dominate the photovoltaic effect will depend on many material parameters.</p>
<p>In most photovoltaic applications the <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> is sunlight, and the devices are called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_cells" title="Solar cells">solar cells</a>. In the case of a p-n junction solar cell, illuminating the material creates an electric current as excited electrons and the remaining holes are swept in different directions by the built-in electric field of the depletion region.</p>
