<p><b>Google Books</b> (previously known as <b>Google Book Search</b> and <b>Google Print</b>) is a service from <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google Inc.</a> that searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned, converted to text using <a href="/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" title="Optical character recognition">optical character recognition</a> (OCR), and stored in its digital database. Books are provided either by publishers and authors, through the Google Books Partner Program, or by Google's library partners, through the Library Project. Additionally, Google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives.</p>
<p>The Publisher Program was first known as 'Google Print' when it was introduced at the <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt_Book_Fair" title="Frankfurt Book Fair">Frankfurt Book Fair</a> in October 2004. The Google Books Library Project, which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory, was announced in December 2004.</p>
<p>The Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the <a href="/wiki/Democratization_of_knowledge" title="Democratization of knowledge">democratization of knowledge</a>. But it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations, and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process.</p>
<p>As of October 2015, the number of scanned book titles was over 25 million, but the <a href="/wiki/Book_scanning" title="Book scanning">scanning process</a> has slowed down in American academic libraries. Google estimated in 2010 that there were about 130 million distinct titles in the world, and stated that it intended to scan all of them.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Details">Details</span></h2>
<p>Results from Google Books show up in both the universal <a href="/wiki/Google_Search" title="Google Search">Google Search</a> as well as in the dedicated Google Books search website (<i>books.google.com</i>).</p>
<p>In response to search queries, Google Books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear, if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission. If Google believes the book is still under copyright, a user sees "snippets" of text around the queried search terms. All instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight.</p>
<p>The four access levels used on Google Books are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Full view</b>: Books in the <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a> are available for "full view" and can be downloaded for free. In-print books acquired through the Partner Program are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission, although this is rare.</li>
<li><b>Preview</b>: For in-print books where permission has been granted, the number of viewable pages is limited to a "preview" set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures, some based on user-tracking. Usually, the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview. Users are restricted from copying, downloading or printing book previews. A watermark reading "Copyrighted material" appears at the bottom of pages. All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview.</li>
<li><b>Snippet view</b>: A 'snippet view' – two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term – is displayed in cases where Google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview. This could be because Google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission. If a search term appears many times in a book, Google displays no more than three snippets, thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book. Also, Google does not display any snippets for certain reference books, such as dictionaries, where the display of even snippets can harm the market for the work. Google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view.</li>
<li><b>No preview</b>: Google also displays search results for books that have not been digitized. As these books have not been scanned, their text is not searchable and only the <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a> information such as the title, author, publisher, number of pages, ISBN, subject and copyright information, and in some cases, a table of contents and book summary is available. In effect, this is similar to an online library card catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to criticism from groups such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Association_of_Publishers" title="American Association of Publishers">American Association of Publishers</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Authors_Guild" title="Authors Guild">Authors Guild</a>, Google announced an <a href="/wiki/Opt-out" title="Opt-out">opt-out</a> policy in August 2005, through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that it did not want scanned, and Google would respect the request. Google also stated that it would not scan any in-copyright books between August and 1 November 2005, to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the Project. Thus, Google provides a copyright owner with three choices with respect to any work:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can participate in the Partner Program to make a book available for preview or full view, in which case it would share revenue derived from the display of pages from the work in response to user queries.</li>
<li>It can let Google scan the book under the Library Project and display snippets in response to user queries.</li>
<li>It can opt out of the Library Project, in which case Google will not scan the book. If the book has already been scanned, Google will reset its access level as 'No preview'.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each book on Google Books has an associated "About this book" page which displays analytical information regarding the book such as a word map of the most used words and phrases, a selection of pages, list of related books, list of scholarly articles and other books that cite the book, and tables of content. This information is collated through automated methods, and sometimes data from third-party sources is used. This information provides an insight into the book, particularly useful when only a snippet view is available. The list of related books can often contain irrelevant entries. In some cases, a book summary and information about the author is also displayed. The page also displays bibliographic information, which can be exported as citations in <a href="/wiki/BibTeX" title="BibTeX">BibTeX</a>, <a href="/wiki/EndNote" title="EndNote">EndNote</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reference_Manager" title="Reference Manager">RefMan</a> formats. Registered users logged in with their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Google_account" title="Google account">Google accounts</a> can post reviews for books on this page. Google Books also displays reviews from <a href="/wiki/Goodreads" title="Goodreads">Goodreads</a> alongside these reviews.</p>
<p>Most scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available. For those which are, the site provides links to the website of the publisher and booksellers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Linking">Linking</span></h3>
<p>Google Books can retrieve scanned books from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator" title="Uniform resource locator">URLs</a> based on the <a href="/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number" title="International Standard Book Number">International Standard Book Numbers</a> (ISBN), <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number" title="Library of Congress Control Number">Library of Congress Control Numbers</a> (LCCN) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Online_Computer_Library_Center" title="Online Computer Library Center">Online Computer Library Center</a> (OCLC) record numbers. For example, the 'About this book' page of a book with the ISBN 0521349931 can be linked as <i>books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521349931</i></p>
<p>For some books, Google also provides the ability to link directly to the front cover, title page, copyright page, table of contents, index, and back cover of a book, by using an appropriate parameter. For example, the front cover of a book with the OCLC number 17546826 can be linked as <i>books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC17546826&amp;printsec=frontcover</i></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Page_numbering">Page numbering</span></h3>
<p>For many books, Google Books displays the original page numbers, resulting in many benefits such as enabling writers to prepare citations with page numbers without needing to have a print copy of the book. However, Tim Parks, writing in <i>The New York Review Blogs</i>, noted that Google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications, "presumably in alliance with the publishers, in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scanning_of_books">Scanning of books</span></h3>
<p>Many of the books are scanned using a customized <a href="/wiki/Elphel" title="Elphel">Elphel</a> 323 camera at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour. A <a href="/wiki/Patent" title="Patent">patent</a> awarded to Google in 2009 revealed that Google had come up with an innovative system for <a href="/wiki/Book_scanning" title="Book scanning">scanning books</a> that uses two cameras and infrared light to automatically correct for the curvature of pages in a book. By constructing a 3D model of each page and then "de-warping" it, Google is able to present flat-looking pages without having to really make the pages flat, which requires the use of destructive methods such as <a href="/wiki/Book_scanning#Unbinding" title="Book scanning">unbinding</a> or glass plates to individually flatten each page, which is inefficient for large scale scanning.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="N-gram_Viewer">N-gram Viewer</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer" title="Google Ngram Viewer">N-gram</a> is a service connected to Google Books, it graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection. This service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods. This program has fallen under criticism because of metadata errors used in the program.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Errors">Errors</span></h2>
<p>Google allows users to report errors in books at the website <i><a class="external text" href="https://support.google.com/books/partner/troubleshooter/2983879" rel="nofollow">support.google.com/books/partner/troubleshooter/2983879</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Errors_in_content">Errors in content</span></h3>

<p>The scanning process is subject to errors. For example, some pages may be unreadable, upside down, or in the wrong order. Scholars have even reported crumpled pages, obscuring thumbs and fingers, and smeared or blurry images. On this issue, a declaration from Google at the end of scanned books says:</p>

<p>As of 2009 Google stated that they would start using <a href="/wiki/ReCAPTCHA" title="ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> to help fix the errors found in Google Book scanning’s. This method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Errors_in_metadata">Errors in metadata</span></h3>
<p>Scholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the metadata information on Google Books – including misattributed authors and erroneous dates of publication. <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Nunberg" title="Geoffrey Nunberg">Geoffrey Nunberg</a>, a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before 1950 and containing the word "internet" turned up an unlikely 527 results. Woody Allen is mentioned in 325 books ostensibly published before he was born. Google responded to Nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on the outside contractors.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Timeline">Timeline</span></h2>
<p><b>2002</b>: A group of team members at Google officially launch the “secret ‘books’ project.” Google founders <a href="/wiki/Sergey_Brin" title="Sergey Brin">Sergey Brin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Larry_Page" title="Larry Page">Larry Page</a> came up with the idea that later became Google Books while still graduate students at Stanford in 1996. The history page on the Google Books website describes their initial vision for this project: “in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a ‘<a href="/wiki/Web_crawler" title="Web crawler">web crawler</a>’ to index the books’ content and analyze the connections between them, determining any given book’s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books.” This team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the Library of Congress’s <a href="/wiki/American_Memory" title="American Memory">American Memory Project</a>, <a href="/wiki/Project_Gutenberg" title="Project Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a>, and the Universal Library to find out how they work, as well as the University of Michigan, Page’s alma mater, and the base for such digitization projects as <a href="/wiki/JSTOR" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> and Making of America. In a conversation with the at that time University President <a href="/wiki/Mary_Sue_Coleman" title="Mary Sue Coleman">Mary Sue Coleman</a>, when Page found out that the University’s current estimate for scanning all the library’s volumes was 1,000 years, Page reportedly told Coleman that he “believes Google can help make it happen in six."</p>
<p><b>2003</b>: The team works to develop a high-speed scanning process as well as software for resolving issues in odd type sizes, unusual fonts, and "other unexpected peculiarities."</p>
<p><b>December 2004</b>: Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project. Google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries, including the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harvard_University_Library" title="Harvard University Library">Harvard University Library</a>), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stanford" title="Stanford">Stanford</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_Library" title="Green Library">Green Library</a>), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a> (<a href="/wiki/Bodleian_Library" title="Bodleian Library">Bodleian Library</a>), and the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Public_Library" title="New York Public Library">New York Public Library</a>. According to press releases and university librarians, Google planned to digitize and make available through its Google Books service approximately 15 million volumes within a decade. The announcement soon triggered controversy, as publisher and author associations challenged Google's plans to digitize, not just books in the public domain, but also titles still under copyright.</p>
<p><b>September–October 2005</b>: Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyrights</a> and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers. One is a class action suit on behalf of authors (Authors Guild v. Google, Sept. 20 2005) and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the <a href="/wiki/Association_of_American_Publishers" title="Association of American Publishers">Association of American Publishers</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Google_Books_Partner_Program">Google Books Partner Program</span></h2>
<p>The Partner Program is an online-book marketing program designed to help publishers and authors promote their books. Publishers and authors submit either a digital copy of their book in <a href="/wiki/EPUB" title="EPUB">EPUB</a> or <a href="/wiki/Portable_Document_Format" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> format, or a print copy to Google, which are made available on Google Books for preview. The publisher can control the percentage of the book available for preview, with the minimum being 20%. They can also choose to make the book fully viewable, and even allow users to download a PDF copy.</p>
<p>Books can also be made available for sale on Google Play.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Google_Books_Library_Project">Google Books Library Project</span></h2>
<p>The <b>Google Books Library Project</b> is an effort by Google to scan and make searchable the collections of several major research <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Libraries" title="Libraries">libraries</a>. Along with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bibliographic" title="Bibliographic">bibliographic</a> information, snippets of text from a book are often viewable. If a book is out of <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> and in the public domain, the book is fully available to read or to <a href="/wiki/Download" title="Download">download</a>.</p>
<p>In-copyright books scanned through the Library Project are made available on Google Books for snippet view. Regarding the quality of scans, Google acknowledges that they are "not always of sufficiently high quality" to be offered for sale on Google Play. Also, because of supposed technical constraints, Google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers.</p>
<p>The project is the subject of the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Authors_Guild_v._Google" title="Authors Guild v. Google">Authors Guild v. Google</a></i> lawsuit, filed in 2005 and ruled in favor of Google in 2013, and again, on appeal, in 2015.</p>
<p>Copyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view (by 'transferring' it to their Partner Program account), or request Google to prevent the book text from being searched.</p>
<p>The number of institutions participating in the Library Project has grown since its inception. The <a href="/wiki/University_of_Mysore" title="University of Mysore">University of Mysore</a> has been mentioned in many media reports as being a library partner, although it is not listed as a partner by Google.</p>

<p>Google Books allows signed-in users to create a personalized collection or a library of books. Organized through 'bookshelves', books can be added to the library using a button that appears along with search results or from the 'Overview' page of books. The library can be shared with friends by making bookshelves publicly visible and sharing the secret library URL. Users can also import a list of books to the library using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ISBN" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ISSN" title="ISSN">ISSN</a> numbers. There are four default bookshelves which cannot be renamed: <i>Favorites</i>, <i>Reading now</i>, <i>To read</i> and <i>Have read</i>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the library also consists of some default bookshelves ("Purchased", "Reviewed", "My Books on Google Play", "Recently viewed", "Browing history", "Books for you") to which books get added automatically. Users cannot add or remove books from these bookshelves.</p>

<p>Through the project, library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status, which led to a number of lawsuits against Google. By the end of 2008, Google had reportedly digitized over seven million books, of which only about one million were works in the public domain. Of the rest, one million were in copyright and in print, and five million were in copyright but out of print. In 2005, a group of authors and publishers brought a major class-action lawsuit against Google for infringement on the copyrighted works. Google argued that it was preserving "orphaned works" – books still under copyright, but whose copyright holders could not be located.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Authors_Guild" title="Authors Guild">Authors Guild</a> and <a href="/wiki/Association_of_American_Publishers" title="Association of American Publishers">Association of American Publishers</a> separately sued Google in 2005 for its book project, citing "massive <a href="/wiki/Copyright_infringement" title="Copyright infringement">copyright infringement</a>." Google countered that its project represented a <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a> and is the digital age equivalent of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Card_catalog" title="Card catalog">card catalog</a> with every word in the publication indexed. The lawsuits were consolidated, and eventually a <a href="/wiki/Google_Book_Search_Settlement_Agreement" title="Google Book Search Settlement Agreement">settlement was proposed</a>. The settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds, including antitrust, privacy, and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers. The settlement was eventually rejected, and the publishers settled with Google soon after. The Authors Guild continued its case, and in 2011 their proposed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_certification" title="Class certification">class was certified</a>. Google appealed that decision, with a number of <a href="/wiki/Amicus_curiae" title="Amicus curiae">amici</a> asserting the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Inadequacy_of_the_class&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Inadequacy of the class (page does not exist)">inadequacy of the class</a>, and the Second Circuit rejected the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_certification" title="Class certification">class certification</a> in July 2013, remanding the case to the District Court for consideration of Google's <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a> defense.</p>
<p>In 2015 Authors Guild filed another appeal against Google to be considered by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets and there are not allowing people to illegally read the book. In a report courts stated that they did not infringe on copy write laws as they were protected under the fair use clause.</p>
<p>Authors Guild tried again in 2016 to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the Supreme Court. The case was rejected leaving the Second Circuits decision on the case in tact meaning that Google did not violate copy right laws. This case also set a precedent for other case similar in regards to fair use laws as it further clarified the law and expands it. Such clarification is important in the new digital age as it effects other scanning projects similar to Google.</p>
<p>Other lawsuits followed the Authors Guild's lead. In 2006 a German lawsuit, previously filed, was withdrawn. In June 2006, Hervé de la Martinière, a French publisher known as La Martinière and <a href="/wiki/%C3%89ditions_du_Seuil" title="Éditions du Seuil">Éditions du Seuil</a>, announced its intention to sue Google France. In 2009, the Paris Civil Court awarded 300,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EUR" title="EUR">EUR</a> (approximately 430,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USD" title="USD">USD</a>) in damages and interest and ordered Google to pay 10,000 EUR a day until it removes the publisher's books from its database. The court wrote, "Google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible" books that Seuil owns without its permission and that Google "committed acts of breach of copyright, which are of harm to the publishers". Google said it will appeal. Syndicat National de l'Edition, which joined the lawsuit, said Google has scanned about 100,000 French works under copyright.</p>
<p>In December 2009, Chinese author <a href="/wiki/Mian_Mian" title="Mian Mian">Mian Mian</a> filed a civil lawsuit for $8,900 against Google for scanning her novel, <i>Acid Lovers</i>. This is the first such lawsuit to be filed against Google in China. Also, in November that year, the China Written Works Copyright Society (CWWCS) accused Google of scanning 18,000 books by 570 Chinese writers without authorization. Google agreed on Nov 20 to provide a list of Chinese books it had scanned, but the company refused to admit having "infringed" copyright laws.</p>
<p>In March 2007, Thomas Rubin, associate general counsel for copyright, trademark, and trade secrets at Microsoft, accused Google of violating copyright law with their book search service. Rubin specifically criticized Google's policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop.</p>
<p>Google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of <a href="/wiki/Digital_watermarking" title="Digital watermarking">digital watermarking</a> techniques with the books. Some published works that are in the public domain, such as all <a href="/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government" title="Copyright status of work by the U.S. government">works created by the U.S. Federal government</a>, are still treated like other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Academic_criticism">Academic criticism</span></h3>
<p>For many scholars, a far more egregious problem with the project stems from the fact that it does not seem to be meeting its fundamental state goal of "preserving" orphaned and out-of-print works. Google has apparently been passing huge numbers of scanned and electronic-text books into circulation without editing the texts for errors introduced by the digitizing processes. This problem has been apparent for a number of years, but became obvious in a big way in 2014, when Google formed a partnership with bookseller <a href="/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble" title="Barnes &amp; Noble">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, through which Google made more than a half a million <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a> texts available to Barnes &amp; Noble, to be offered for free on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nook" title="Nook">Nook</a> Shop for their e-readers.</p>
<p>Customers downloading these books discovered that as many as 80% of them were essentially unreadable, riddled with a large number of errors introduced by either the scanning process itself, or the conversion of the scans into electronic texts via <a href="/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" title="Optical character recognition">Optical character recognition</a> (OCR) software. Google apparently scanned the texts, but did not trouble to <i>edit</i> them for errors, and Barnes &amp; Noble compounded the problem by not exercising any quality control over the Google texts, simply offering them unexamined in their shop to customers. The effect of the scan and OCR errors is to render the contents of many books essentially unreadable, a problem especially in scientific works, where incorrectly rendered, missing, or extraneous characters in scientific equations may render them meaningless.</p>
<p>Also of concern are the large numbers of <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a> errors in the Google collection. Metadata refers to the information which identifies a particular text: title, author, publisher, publication place and date, subject classification, etc. – essentially the information which would be found in a library card catalog.</p>
<p>One investigator found thousands of such errors in the samples he took, including publication dates that predated the birth of the books' author (e.g., 182 works by Charles Dickens supposedly published prior to his birth in 1812), wildly inappropriate subject classifications (an edition of <i>Moby Dick</i> found under "computers", a biography of Mae West classified under "religion"), conflicting classifications (10 editions of Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i> all classified as both "Fiction" and "Nonfiction"), incorrectly spelled titles, authors, and publishers (<i>Moby Dick : or the White "Wall"</i>), metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book (the metadata for an 1818 mathematical work leads to a 1963 romance novel), books about the Internet with publication dated before the Internet existed, and many more.</p>


<p>Such metadata errors can make doing serious research using the Google Books Project database difficult if not impossible – even assuming all of the scanned texts were edited and error corrected. To date, Google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Language_issues">Language issues</span></h3>
<p>Some European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_imperialism" title="Linguistic imperialism">linguistic imperialism</a> grounds. They argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world. German, Russian, French, and Spanish, for instance, are popular languages in <a href="/wiki/Scholarship" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a>. The disproportionate online emphasis on English, however, could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship. Among these critics is <a href="/wiki/Jean-No%C3%ABl_Jeanneney" title="Jean-Noël Jeanneney">Jean-Noël Jeanneney</a>, the former president of the <i><a href="/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France" title="Bibliothèque nationale de France">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Google_Books_versus_Google_Scholar">Google Books versus Google Scholar</span></h3>
<p>While Google Books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues, its scans do not include the <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a> required for identifying specific articles in specific issues. This has led the makers of <a href="/wiki/Google_Scholar" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a> to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles (in agreement with their publishers).</p>
