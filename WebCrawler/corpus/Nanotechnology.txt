<p><b>Nanotechnology</b> ("<b>nanotech</b>") is manipulation of matter on an <a href="/wiki/Atom" title="Atom">atomic</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molecular" title="Molecular">molecular</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supramolecular_complex" title="Supramolecular complex">supramolecular</a> scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as <a href="/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology" title="Molecular nanotechnology">molecular nanotechnology</a>. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the <a href="/wiki/National_Nanotechnology_Initiative" title="National Nanotechnology Initiative">National Nanotechnology Initiative</a>, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanometers" title="Nanometers">nanometers</a>. This definition reflects the fact that <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> effects are important at this <a href="/wiki/Quantum_realm" title="Quantum realm">quantum-realm</a> scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as <a href="/wiki/Surface_science" title="Surface science">surface science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Organic_chemistry" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molecular_biology" title="Molecular biology">molecular biology</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semiconductor_physics" title="Semiconductor physics">semiconductor physics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Microfabrication" title="Microfabrication">microfabrication</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molecular_engineering" title="Molecular engineering">molecular engineering</a>, etc. The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor_device" title="Semiconductor device">device physics</a> to completely new approaches based upon <a href="/wiki/Molecular_self-assembly" title="Molecular self-assembly">molecular self-assembly</a>, from developing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanomaterial" title="Nanomaterial">new materials</a> with dimensions on the nanoscale to <a href="/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology" title="Molecular nanotechnology">direct control of matter on the atomic scale</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists currently debate the future <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Implications_of_nanotechnology" title="Implications of nanotechnology">implications of nanotechnology</a>. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_nanotechnology_applications" title="List of nanotechnology applications">applications</a>, such as in <a href="/wiki/Nanomedicine" title="Nanomedicine">nanomedicine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanoelectronics" title="Nanoelectronics">nanoelectronics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biomaterial" title="Biomaterial">biomaterials</a> energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the <a href="/wiki/Nanotoxicology" title="Nanotoxicology">toxicity</a> and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various <a href="/wiki/Grey_goo" title="Grey goo">doomsday scenarios</a>. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special <a href="/wiki/Regulation_of_nanotechnology" title="Regulation of nanotechnology">regulation of nanotechnology</a> is warranted.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_nanotechnology" title="History of nanotechnology">History of nanotechnology</a></div>
<p>The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist <a href="/wiki/Richard_Feynman" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> in his talk <i><a href="/wiki/There%27s_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom" title="There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom">There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a></i>, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms. The term "nano-technology" was first used by <a href="/wiki/Norio_Taniguchi" title="Norio Taniguchi">Norio Taniguchi</a> in 1974, though it was not widely known.</p>

<p>Inspired by Feynman's concepts, <a href="/wiki/K._Eric_Drexler" title="K. Eric Drexler">K. Eric Drexler</a> used the term "nanotechnology" in his 1986 book <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Engines_of_creation" title="Engines of creation">Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology</a></i>, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Foresight_Institute" title="The Foresight Institute">The Foresight Institute</a> (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.</p>
<p>Thus, emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era.</p>
<p>First, the invention of the <a href="/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope" title="Scanning tunneling microscope">scanning tunneling microscope</a> in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope's developers <a href="/wiki/Gerd_Binnig" title="Gerd Binnig">Gerd Binnig</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Rohrer" title="Heinrich Rohrer">Heinrich Rohrer</a> at <a href="/wiki/IBM_Zurich_Research_Laboratory" title="IBM Zurich Research Laboratory">IBM Zurich Research Laboratory</a> received a <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1986. Binnig, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calvin_F._Quate" title="Calvin F. Quate">Quate</a> and Gerber also invented the analogous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_force_microscope" title="Atomic force microscope">atomic force microscope</a> that year.</p>

<p>Second, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fullerenes" title="Fullerenes">Fullerenes</a> were discovered in 1985 by <a href="/wiki/Harry_Kroto" title="Harry Kroto">Harry Kroto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Smalley" title="Richard Smalley">Richard Smalley</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Curl" title="Robert Curl">Robert Curl</a>, who together won the 1996 <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize in Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>. C<sub>60</sub> was not initially described as nanotechnology; the term was used regarding subsequent work with related <a href="/wiki/Graphene" title="Graphene">graphene</a> tubes (called <a href="/wiki/Carbon_nanotube" title="Carbon nanotube">carbon nanotubes</a> and sometimes called Bucky tubes) which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the field garnered increased scientific, political, and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress. Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a>'s report on nanotechnology. Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging. These products are limited to bulk applications of <a href="/wiki/Nanomaterials" title="Nanomaterials">nanomaterials</a> and do not involve atomic control of matter. Some examples include the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Nano" title="Silver Nano">Silver Nano</a> platform for using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silver_nanoparticles" title="Silver nanoparticles">silver nanoparticles</a> as an antibacterial agent, <a href="/wiki/Nanoparticle" title="Nanoparticle">nanoparticle</a>-based transparent sunscreens, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_fibers" title="Carbon fibers">carbon fiber</a> strengthening using silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles.</p>
<p>Governments moved to promote and <a href="/wiki/Funding_of_science" title="Funding of science">fund research</a> into nanotechnology, such as in the U.S. with the <a href="/wiki/National_Nanotechnology_Initiative" title="National Nanotechnology Initiative">National Nanotechnology Initiative</a>, which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on the nanoscale, and in Europe via the European <a href="/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development" title="Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development">Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development</a>.</p>
<p>By the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish. Projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fundamental_concepts">Fundamental concepts</span></h2>
<p>Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.</p>
<p>One <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanometer" title="Nanometer">nanometer</a> (nm) is one billionth, or 10, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon <a href="/wiki/Bond_length" title="Bond length">bond lengths</a>, or the spacing between these <a href="/wiki/Atom" title="Atom">atoms</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecule</a>, are in the range <span class="nowrap">0.12–0.15 nm</span>, and a <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cellular</a> life-forms, the bacteria of the genus <a href="/wiki/Mycoplasma" title="Mycoplasma">Mycoplasma</a>, are around 200 nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range <span class="nowrap">1 to 100 nm</span> following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device. These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent <a href="/wiki/Macroscopic_scale" title="Macroscopic scale">macroscopic</a> device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of <a href="/wiki/Microtechnology" title="Microtechnology">microtechnology</a>.</p>
<p>To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth. Or another way of putting it: a nanometer is the amount an average man's beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face.</p>
<p>Two main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the "bottom-up" approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which <a href="/wiki/Self-assembly" title="Self-assembly">assemble themselves</a> chemically by principles of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_recognition" title="Molecular recognition">molecular recognition</a>. In the "top-down" approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.</p>
<p>Areas of physics such as <a href="/wiki/Nanoelectronics" title="Nanoelectronics">nanoelectronics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanomechanics" title="Nanomechanics">nanomechanics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanophotonics" title="Nanophotonics">nanophotonics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nanoionics" title="Nanoionics">nanoionics</a> have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Nanomaterials" title="Nanomaterials">Nanomaterials</a></div>
<p>Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include <a href="/wiki/Statistical_mechanics" title="Statistical mechanics">statistical mechanical</a> effects, as well as <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> effects, for example the "<a href="/wiki/Quantum" title="Quantum">quantum</a> size effect" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called <a href="/wiki/Quantum_realm" title="Quantum realm">quantum realm</a>. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics. <i>Mechanical</i> properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with <a href="/wiki/Biomaterial" title="Biomaterial">biomaterials</a>.</p>
<p>Materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Simple_to_complex:_a_molecular_perspective">Simple to complex: a molecular perspective</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Molecular_self-assembly" title="Molecular self-assembly">Molecular self-assembly</a></div>
<p>Modern <a href="/wiki/Chemical_synthesis" title="Chemical synthesis">synthetic chemistry</a> has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as <a href="/wiki/Drug" title="Drug">pharmaceuticals</a> or commercial <a href="/wiki/Polymer" title="Polymer">polymers</a>. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into <a href="/wiki/Supramolecular_assembly" title="Supramolecular assembly">supramolecular assemblies</a> consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.</p>
<p>These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or <a href="/wiki/Supramolecular_chemistry" title="Supramolecular chemistry">supramolecular chemistry</a> to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up#Nanotechnology" title="Top-down and bottom-up">bottom-up</a> approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Noncovalent_bonding" title="Noncovalent bonding">non-covalent</a> <a href="/wiki/Intermolecular_force" title="Intermolecular force">intermolecular forces</a>. The Watson–Crick <a href="/wiki/Base_pair" title="Base pair">basepairing</a> rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> being targeted to a single <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)" title="Substrate (biochemistry)">substrate</a>, or the specific <a href="/wiki/Protein_folding" title="Protein folding">folding of the protein</a> itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.</p>
<p>Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a>, most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Molecular_nanotechnology:_a_long-term_view">Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology" title="Molecular nanotechnology">Molecular nanotechnology</a></div>
<p>Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the <a href="/wiki/Molecular_assembler" title="Molecular assembler">molecular assembler</a>, a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of <a href="/wiki/Mechanosynthesis" title="Mechanosynthesis">mechanosynthesis</a>. Manufacturing in the context of <a href="/wiki/Productive_nanosystems" title="Productive nanosystems">productive nanosystems</a> is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.</p>
<p>When the term "nanotechnology" was independently coined and popularized by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eric_Drexler" title="Eric Drexler">Eric Drexler</a> (who at the time was unaware of an <a href="/wiki/History_of_nanotechnology" title="History of nanotechnology">earlier usage</a> by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on <a href="/wiki/Molecular_machine" title="Molecular machine">molecular machine</a> systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, <a href="/wiki/Stochastic" title="Stochastic">stochastically</a> optimised <a href="/wiki/Molecular_machine#Biological" title="Molecular machine">biological machines</a> can be produced.</p>
<p>It is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biomimetic" title="Biomimetic">biomimetic</a> principles. However, Drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification. The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book <i>Nanosystems</i>.</p>
<p>In general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale, as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Another view, put forth by Carlo Montemagno, is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines. Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.</p>
<p>This led to an exchange of letters in the <a href="/wiki/American_Chemical_Society" title="American Chemical Society">ACS</a> publication <a href="/wiki/Chemical_%26_Engineering_News" title="Chemical &amp; Engineering News">Chemical &amp; Engineering News</a> in 2003. Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible, non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy. Leaders in research on non-biological molecular machines are Dr. <a href="/wiki/Alex_Zettl" title="Alex Zettl">Alex Zettl</a> and his colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley.<a class="external autonumber" href="http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/zettl/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> They have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage: a nanotube <a href="/wiki/Nanomotor" title="Nanomotor">nanomotor</a>, a molecular actuator, and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator. See <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanotube_nanomotor" title="Nanotube nanomotor">nanotube nanomotor</a> for more examples.</p>
<p>An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by Ho and Lee at <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> in 1999. They used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.</p>

Because of the discrete (i.e. atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution. <a href="/wiki/Mihail_Roco" title="Mihail Roco">Mihail Roco</a>, one of the architects of the USA's National Nanotechnology Initiative, has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanomachine" title="Nanomachine">nanomachines</a> and ultimately to productive nanosystems.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Programmable_matter" title="Programmable matter">Programmable matter</a> seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of <a href="/wiki/Information_science" title="Information science">information science</a> and <a href="/wiki/Materials_science" title="Materials science">materials science</a>.</li>
<li>Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words <a href="/wiki/Picotechnology" title="Picotechnology">picotechnology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Femtotechnology" title="Femtotechnology">femtotechnology</a> have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dimensionality_in_nanomaterials">Dimensionality in nanomaterials</span></h3>
<p>Nanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D <a href="/wiki/Nanomaterials" title="Nanomaterials">nanomaterials</a>. The dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/physical" title="wikt:physical">physical</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological" title="Biological">biological</a> characteristics. With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed. This indicate that smaller dimensional <a href="/wiki/Nanomaterials" title="Nanomaterials">nanomaterials</a> have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials. Recently, <a href="/wiki/Two_dimensional_(2D)_nanomaterials" title="Two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials">two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials</a> are extensively investigated for <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronic</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biomedical" title="Biomedical">biomedical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drug_delivery" title="Drug delivery">drug delivery</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biosensor" title="Biosensor">biosensor</a> applications.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tools_and_techniques">Tools and techniques</span></h2>

<p>There are several important modern developments. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_force_microscope" title="Atomic force microscope">atomic force microscope</a> (AFM) and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scanning_Tunneling_Microscope" title="Scanning Tunneling Microscope">Scanning Tunneling Microscope</a> (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of <a href="/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy" title="Scanning probe microscopy">scanning probe microscopy</a>. Although conceptually similar to the scanning <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confocal_microscope" title="Confocal microscope">confocal microscope</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Marvin_Minsky" title="Marvin Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> in 1961 and the <a href="/wiki/Scanning_acoustic_microscope" title="Scanning acoustic microscope">scanning acoustic microscope</a> (SAM) developed by <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Quate" title="Calvin Quate">Calvin Quate</a> and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.</p>
<p>The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). <a href="/wiki/Feature-oriented_scanning" title="Feature-oriented scanning">Feature-oriented scanning</a> methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode. However, this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope.</p>
<p>Various techniques of nanolithography such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optical_lithography" title="Optical lithography">optical lithography</a>, <a href="/wiki/X-ray_lithography" title="X-ray lithography">X-ray lithography</a> dip pen nanolithography, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electron_beam_lithography" title="Electron beam lithography">electron beam lithography</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nanoimprint_lithography" title="Nanoimprint lithography">nanoimprint lithography</a> were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.</p>
<p>Another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ion_track_technology_(track_etching)" title="Ion track technology (track etching)">nanotubes</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ion_track_technology_(track_replication)" title="Ion track technology (track replication)">nanowires</a>, those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.</p>
<p>The top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.</p>
<p>In contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, <a href="/wiki/Self-assembly" title="Self-assembly">self-assembly</a> and positional assembly. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dual_polarisation_interferometry" title="Dual polarisation interferometry">Dual polarisation interferometry</a> is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is <a href="/wiki/Molecular_beam_epitaxy" title="Molecular beam epitaxy">molecular beam epitaxy</a> or MBE. Researchers at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Laboratories" title="Bell Telephone Laboratories">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a> like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of <a href="/wiki/Spintronics" title="Spintronics">spintronics</a>.</p>
<p>However, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive <a href="/wiki/Transfersome" title="Transfersome">Transfersome</a> vesicles, are under development and already approved for human use in some countries.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Applications">Applications</span></h2>


<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_nanotechnology_applications" title="List of nanotechnology applications">List of nanotechnology applications</a></div>
<p>As of August 21, 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Project_on_Emerging_Nanotechnologies" title="Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies">Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies</a> estimates that over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week. The project lists all of the products in a publicly accessible online database. Most applications are limited to the use of "first generation" passive nanomaterials which includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen, cosmetics, surface coatings, and some food products; Carbon allotropes used to produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gecko_tape" title="Gecko tape">gecko tape</a>; silver in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances; zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics, surface coatings, paints and outdoor furniture varnishes; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.</p>
<p>Further applications allow <a href="/wiki/Tennis_ball" title="Tennis ball">tennis balls</a> to last longer, <a href="/wiki/Golf_ball" title="Golf ball">golf balls</a> to fly straighter, and even <a href="/wiki/Bowling_ball" title="Bowling ball">bowling balls</a> to become more durable and have a harder surface. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trouser" title="Trouser">Trousers</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socks" title="Socks">socks</a> have been infused with nanotechnology so that they will last longer and keep people cool in the summer. <a href="/wiki/Bandage" title="Bandage">Bandages</a> are being infused with silver nanoparticles to heal cuts faster. <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console" title="Video game console">Video game consoles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a> may become cheaper, faster, and contain more memory thanks to nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the <a href="/wiki/General_practitioner" title="General practitioner">general practitioner</a>'s office and at home. Cars are being manufactured with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanomaterial" title="Nanomaterial">nanomaterials</a> so they may need fewer <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metals</a> and less <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a> to operate in the future.</p>
<p>Scientists are now turning to nanotechnology in an attempt to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes. Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine <a href="/wiki/Catalysis" title="Catalysis">catalyst</a> in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water. Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts. Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology also has a prominent role in the fast developing field of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tissue_Engineering" title="Tissue Engineering">Tissue Engineering</a>. When designing scaffolds, researchers attempt to the mimic the nanoscale features of a <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">Cell</a>'s microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage. For example, when creating scaffolds to support the growth of bone, researchers may mimic <a href="/wiki/Osteoclast" title="Osteoclast">osteoclast</a> <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Resorption_pits&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Resorption pits (page does not exist)">resorption pits</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers have successfully used <a href="/wiki/DNA_origami" title="DNA origami">DNA origami</a>-based nanobots capable of carrying out logic functions to achieve targeted drug delivery in cockroaches. It is said that the computational power of these nanobots can be scaled up to that of a <a href="/wiki/Commodore_64" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Implications_of_nanotechnology" title="Implications of nanotechnology">Implications of nanotechnology</a></div>
<p>An area of concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials would have on human health and the environment, as suggested by <a href="/wiki/Nanotoxicology" title="Nanotoxicology">nanotoxicology</a> research. For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments. Others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations. <a href="/wiki/Public_health" title="Public health">Public health</a> research agencies, such as the <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health" title="National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> are actively conducting research on potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Some nanoparticle products may have <a href="/wiki/Unintended_consequences" title="Unintended consequences">unintended consequences</a>. Researchers have discovered that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bacteriostatic" title="Bacteriostatic">bacteriostatic</a> silver nanoparticles used in socks to reduce foot odor are being released in the wash. These particles are then flushed into the waste water stream and may destroy bacteria which are critical components of natural ecosystems, farms, and waste treatment processes.</p>
<p>Public deliberations on <a href="/wiki/Risk_perception" title="Risk perception">risk perception</a> in the US and UK carried out by the Center for Nanotechnology in Society found that participants were more positive about nanotechnologies for energy applications than for health applications, with health applications raising moral and ethical dilemmas such as cost and availability.</p>
<p>Experts, including director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies David Rejeski, have testified that successful commercialization depends on adequate oversight, risk research strategy, and public engagement. <a href="/wiki/Berkeley,_California" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a> is currently the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology; <a href="/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but ultimately rejected it. Relevant for both research on and application of nanotechnologies, the <a href="/wiki/Insurability" title="Insurability">insurability</a> of nanotechnology is contested. Without state <a href="/wiki/Regulation_of_nanotechnology" title="Regulation of nanotechnology">regulation of nanotechnology</a>, the availability of private insurance for potential damages is seen as necessary to ensure that burdens are not socialised implicitly.</p>

<p>Nanofibers are used in several areas and in different products, in everything from aircraft wings to tennis rackets. Inhaling airborne nanoparticles and nanofibers may lead to a number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pulmonary_disease" title="Pulmonary disease">pulmonary diseases</a>, e.g. <a href="/wiki/Fibrosis" title="Fibrosis">fibrosis</a>. Researchers have found that when rats breathed in nanoparticles, the particles settled in the brain and lungs, which led to significant increases in biomarkers for inflammation and stress response and that nanoparticles induce skin aging through oxidative stress in hairless mice.</p>
<p>A two-year study at UCLA's School of Public Health found lab mice consuming nano-titanium dioxide showed DNA and chromosome damage to a degree "linked to all the big killers of man, namely cancer, heart disease, neurological disease and aging".</p>
<p>A major study published more recently in <a href="/wiki/Nature_Nanotechnology" title="Nature Nanotechnology">Nature Nanotechnology</a> suggests some forms of carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the "nanotechnology revolution" – could be as harmful as <a href="/wiki/Asbestos" title="Asbestos">asbestos</a> if inhaled in sufficient quantities. <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Seaton" title="Anthony Seaton">Anthony Seaton</a> of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_nanotubes" title="Carbon nanotubes">carbon nanotubes</a> said "We know that some of them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma. So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully." In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food. A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulation">Regulation</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Regulation_of_nanotechnology" title="Regulation of nanotechnology">Regulation of nanotechnology</a></div>
<p>Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology. There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. Some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes (to varying degrees) – by "bolting on" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes. Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.</p>
<p>Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with <a href="/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy" title="Bovine spongiform encephalopathy">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</a> ("mad cow" disease), <a href="/wiki/Thalidomide" title="Thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, genetically modified food, nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and <a href="/wiki/Asbestosis" title="Asbestosis">asbestosis</a>. Dr. Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. As a result, some academics have called for stricter application of the <a href="/wiki/Precautionary_principle" title="Precautionary principle">precautionary principle</a>, with delayed marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The Royal Society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that "manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure" (p. xiii).</p>
<p>The Center for Nanotechnology in Society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently, depending on application – with participants in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deliberations" title="Deliberations">public deliberations</a> more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications – suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector.</p>
