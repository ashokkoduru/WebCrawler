<p><b>Fossil fuels</b> are <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuels</a> formed by natural processes such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anaerobic_decomposition" title="Anaerobic decomposition">anaerobic decomposition</a> of buried dead <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a>, containing energy originating in ancient <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> and include <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>. Other commonly used derivatives include <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Propane" title="Propane">propane</a>. Fossil fuels range from <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" title="Volatility (chemistry)">volatile</a> materials with low <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a>:<a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> ratios like <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, to liquids like petroleum, to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like <a href="/wiki/Anthracite" title="Anthracite">anthracite</a> coal. Methane can be found in <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> fields either alone, associated with <a href="/wiki/Oil_field" title="Oil field">oil</a>, or in the form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methane_clathrates" title="Methane clathrates">methane clathrates</a>.</p>
<p>The theory that fossil fuels formed from the <a href="/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossilized remains</a> of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years was first introduced by <a href="/wiki/Georgius_Agricola" title="Georgius Agricola">Georgius Agricola</a> in 1556 and later by <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Lomonosov" title="Mikhail Lomonosov">Mikhail Lomonosov</a> in the 18th century.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> estimates that in 2007 the primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0%, coal 27.4%, natural gas 23.0%, amounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world. Non-fossil sources in 2006 included <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear</a> 8.5%, <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> 6.3%, and others (<a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tidal_power" title="Tidal power">tidal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wood_fuel" title="Wood fuel">wood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Waste-to-energy" title="Waste-to-energy">waste</a>) amounting to 0.9%. World energy consumption was growing about 2.3% per year.</p>
<p>Although fossil fuels are continually being formed via natural processes, they are generally considered to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-renewable_resources" title="Non-renewable resources">non-renewable resources</a> because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made.</p>
<p>The use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tonnes" title="Tonnes">tonnes</a> (21.3 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigatonne" title="Gigatonne">gigatonnes</a>) of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide). Carbon dioxide is one of the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> that enhances <a href="/wiki/Radiative_forcing" title="Radiative forcing">radiative forcing</a> and contributes to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, causing the <a href="/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record" title="Instrumental temperature record">average surface temperature</a> of the Earth to rise in response, which <a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">the vast majority of climate scientists</a> agree will cause major <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">adverse effects</a>. A global movement towards the generation of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> is therefore under way to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Petroleum and natural gas are formed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anaerobic_decomposition" title="Anaerobic decomposition">anaerobic decomposition</a> of remains of organisms including <a href="/wiki/Phytoplankton" title="Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a> that settled to the sea (or lake) bottom in large quantities under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anoxic_sea_water" title="Anoxic sea water">anoxic conditions</a>, millions of years ago. Over <a href="/wiki/Geologic_time_scale" title="Geologic time scale">geological time</a>, this <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic</a> <a href="/wiki/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a>, mixed with <a href="/wiki/Mud" title="Mud">mud</a>, got buried under heavy layers of sediment. The resulting high levels of <a href="/wiki/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a> caused the organic matter to chemically <a href="/wiki/Diagenesis" title="Diagenesis">alter</a>, first into a waxy material known as <a href="/wiki/Kerogen" title="Kerogen">kerogen</a> which is found in <a href="/wiki/Oil_shale" title="Oil shale">oil shales</a>, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as <a href="/wiki/Catagenesis_(geology)" title="Catagenesis (geology)">catagenesis</a>. Despite these heat driven transformations (which may increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter), the embedded energy is still photosynthetic in origin.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of organic, or hydrocarbon, compounds in any given fuel mixture. The specific mixture of hydrocarbons gives a fuel its characteristic properties, such as boiling point, melting point, density, viscosity, etc. Some fuels like natural gas, for instance, contain only very low boiling, gaseous components. Others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_plant" title="Terrestrial plant">Terrestrial plants</a>, on the other hand, tend to form <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the <a href="/wiki/Carboniferous" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period of <a href="/wiki/History_of_Earth" title="History of Earth">Earth's history</a>.

<p>Fossil fuels are of great importance because they can be burned (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidized" title="Oxidized">oxidized</a> to <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and water), producing significant amounts of energy per unit weight.

<p><a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">Natural gas</a>, once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production, is now considered a very valuable resource. Natural gas deposits are also the main source of the element <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>.</p>

These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_station" title="Fossil fuel power station">fossil fuel power stations</a> and other uses.</p>
<p>Prior to the latter half of the 18th century, <a href="/wiki/Windmill" title="Windmill">windmills</a> and <a href="/wiki/Watermill" title="Watermill">watermills</a> provided the energy needed for industry such as milling <a href="/wiki/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sawmill" title="Sawmill">sawing wood</a> or pumping water, and burning wood or <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> provided domestic heat.

<p>P. E. Hodgson, a Senior Research Fellow Emeritus in Physics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, expects the world energy use is doubling every fourteen years and the need is increasing faster still and he insisted in 2008 that the world oil production, a main resource of fossil fuel, is expected to peak in ten years and thereafter fall.</p>
<p>The principle of <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a> holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish, prices will rise. Therefore, higher prices will lead to increased alternative, <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit. Artificial gasolines and other <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Petroleum_reserves" title="Petroleum reserves">petroleum reserves</a>, but may become economically viable in the near future.

<p>One of the more promising energy alternatives is the use of inedible feed stocks and biomass for carbon dioxide capture as well as biofuel.

<p>The United States holds less than 5% of the world's population, but due to large houses and private cars, uses more than a quarter of the world's supply of fossil fuels. In the United States, more than 90% of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions" title="Greenhouse gas emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> come from the combustion of fossil fuels. Combustion of fossil fuels also produces other air pollutants, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides" title="Nitrogen oxides">nitrogen oxides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metals" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a>.</p>
<p>According to Environment Canada:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electricity_industry" title="Electricity industry">electricity sector</a> is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues. Electricity generation produces a large share of Canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions, which contribute to smog and <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> and the formation of fine particulate matter. It is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in Canada. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, which may contribute to climate change. In addition, the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species. In particular, <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a> <a href="/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">dams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transmission_line" title="Transmission line">transmission lines</a> have significant effects on water and <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to U.S. Scientist Jerry Mahlman and USA Today: Mahlman, who crafted the IPCC language used to define levels of scientific certainty, says the new report will lay the blame at the feet of fossil fuels with "virtual certainty," meaning 99% sure. That's a significant jump from "likely," or 66% sure, in the group's last report in 2001, Mahlman says. His role in this year's effort involved spending two months reviewing the more than 1,600 pages of research that went into the new assessment.</p>
<p>Combustion of fossil fuels generates <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbonic_acid" title="Carbonic acid">carbonic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acids</a>, which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from <a href="/wiki/Marble" title="Marble">marble</a> and <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a> are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve <a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" title="Calcium carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>.</p>
<p>Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tonnes" title="Tonnes">tonnes</a> of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Three Mile Island accident">Three Mile Island accident</a>.</p>
<p>Burning coal also generates large amounts of <a href="/wiki/Bottom_ash" title="Bottom ash">bottom ash</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fly_ash" title="Fly ash">fly ash</a>. These materials are used in a wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Fly_ash#Fly_ash_reuse" title="Fly ash">applications</a>, utilizing, for example, about 40% of the US production.</p>
<p>Harvesting, processing, and distributing fossil fuels can also create environmental concerns. <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">Coal mining</a> methods, particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining, have negative environmental impacts, and <a href="/wiki/Offshore_drilling" title="Offshore drilling">offshore oil drilling</a> poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. <a href="/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="Oil refinery">Oil refineries</a> also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Transportation of coal requires the use of diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, each of which requires the combustion of additional fossil fuels.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_regulation" title="Environmental regulation">Environmental regulation</a> uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions, such as command-and-control (which mandates the amount of pollution or the technology used), economic incentives, or voluntary programs.</p>
<p>An example of such regulation in the USA is the "EPA is implementing policies to reduce airborne mercury emissions. Under regulations issued in 2005, coal-fired power plants will need to reduce their emissions by 70 percent by 2018.".</p>
<p>In economic terms, pollution from fossil fuels is regarded as a negative <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externality</a>. Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.</p>
<p>According to Rodman D. Griffin, "The burning of coal and oil have saved inestimable amounts of time and labor while substantially raising living standards around the world". Although the use of fossil fuels may seem beneficial to our lives, this act is playing a role on global warming and it is said to be dangerous for the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, these environmental pollutions impacts on the human beings because its particles of the fossil fuel on the air cause negative health effects when inhaled by people. These health effects include premature death, acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. So, the poor, undernourished, very young and very old, and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health, are more at risk.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_effects">Economic effects</span></h3>
<p>Europe spent €406 billion on importing fossil fuels in 2011 and €545 billion in 2012. This is around three times more than the cost of the <a href="/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Facility#Greek_bailout" title="European Financial Stability Facility">Greek bailout</a> up to 2013. In 2012 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy_in_Europe" title="Wind energy in Europe">wind energy in Europe</a> avoided €9.6 billion of fossil fuel costs. A 2014 report by the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> said that the fossil fuels industry collects $550 billion a year in global government subsidies. This amount was $490 billion in 2014, but would have been $610 billion without agreements made in 2009.</p>
<p>A 2015 report studied 20 fossil fuel companies and found that, while highly profitable, the hidden economic cost to society was also large. The report spans the period 2008–2012 and notes that: "For all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was greater than their after‐tax profit, with the single exception of <a href="/wiki/ExxonMobil" title="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> in 2008." Pure coal companies fare even worse: "the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue." In this case, total revenue includes "employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment."</p>
