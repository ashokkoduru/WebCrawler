<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rationale_for_renewables">Rationale for renewables</span></h2>
<p>Renewable energy technologies encompass a broad, diverse array of technologies, including <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">solar photovoltaics</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_power" title="Solar thermal power">solar thermal power</a> plants and heating/cooling systems, <a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">wind farms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a> plants, and <a href="/wiki/Wave_power" title="Wave power">ocean power systems</a> and the use of <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>.</p>
<p>The report <i><a href="/wiki/Outlook_On_Renewable_Energy_In_America" title="Outlook On Renewable Energy In America">Outlook On Renewable Energy In America</a></i> explains that America needs renewable energy, for many reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America needs energy that is secure, reliable, improves public health, protects the environment, addresses climate change, creates jobs, and provides technological leadership. America needs renewable energy. If renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential, America will need coordinated, sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable energy markets; promote and deploy new technology; and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors: wholesale and distributed electricity generation, thermal energy applications, and transportation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another benefit of some renewable energy technologies, like wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric (fossil fuel based) power plants require vast amounts of water for operation.</p>
<p>In 2009, President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration" title="United States presidential inauguration">inaugural address</a> called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of <a href="/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy security</a> and <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. Those were the first references ever to the nation's energy use, to renewable resources, and to climate change in an inauguration speech of a U.S. president. President Obama looked to the near future, saying that as a nation, the United States will "harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."</p>
<p>The president's <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_Energy_For_America" title="New Energy For America">New Energy For America</a></i> plan calls for a federal investment of $150 billion over the next decade to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future. Specifically, the plan calls for renewable energy to supply 10% of the nation's electricity by 2012, rising to 25% by 2025.</p>
<p>In his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joint_address_to_Congress" title="Joint address to Congress">joint address to Congress</a> in 2009, Obama stated that: "We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st. century....Thanks to our <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Obama_recovery_plan" title="Obama recovery plan">recovery plan</a>, we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next three years... It is time for America to lead again".</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Clean_Edge" title="Clean Edge">Clean Edge</a>, there's little doubt that the future of energy will be cleaner. The transition from carbon-intensive energy sources like wood, coal, and oil to natural gas and renewables, is well underway. For much of the developed world, and for developing nations, the "future looks increasingly like it will be built off of a mix of energy efficiency, renewables, the electrification of transport, and lower carbon fuels like natural gas".</p>
<p>A 2010 survey conducted by Applied Materials shows that two-thirds of Americans believe solar technology should play a greater role in meeting the country's energy needs. In addition, "three-quarters of Americans feel that increasing renewable energy and decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil are the country's top energy priorities". According to the survey, "67 percent of Americans would be willing to pay more for their monthly utility bill if their utility company increased its use of renewable energy".</p>
<p>In a 2010 <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Council_on_Global_Affairs" title="Chicago Council on Global Affairs">Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a> public opinion survey, an overwhelming 91 percent believed "investing in renewable energy" is important for the United States to remain economically competitive with other countries, with 62 percent considering this very important. The same poll found strong support for tax incentives to encourage development of renewable energy sources specifically as a way to reduce foreign energy imports. Eight in ten (80 percent) favored tax incentives, 47 percent strongly, and only 17 percent were opposed.</p>
<p>As of 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster" title="Fukushima nuclear disaster">Fukushima nuclear plant</a> have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for “next generation” nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_trends">Current trends</span></h2>

<p>Renewable energy in the United States accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015. California is a leading state and around 29 percent of California's electricity comes from RPS eligible renewable sources (including hydropower).</p>
<p>The United States has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, which have the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation's energy demand. A quarter of the U.S. land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal.</p>
<p>Many of the new technologies that harness renewables — including wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels — are, or soon will be, economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85 percent of U.S. energy needs. Dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies. Energy technologies also receive government subsidies. In 2013, federal government energy-specific subsidies and supports for renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear were $15.043 billion, $3.431 billion and $1.66 billion respectively. The subsidies and supports specific to electricity production amount to $11.678 billion, $1.591 billion and $1.66 billion respectively.</p>
<p>All but a few U.S. states now have incentives in place to promote renewable energy, while more than a dozen have enacted new renewable energy laws in recent years.</p>
<p>Renewable energy suffered a political setback in the United States in September 2011 with the bankruptcy of <a href="/wiki/Solyndra" title="Solyndra">Solyndra</a>, a company that had received a $535 million federal loan guarantee.</p>

<p>The United States used about 4,000 billion kWh/year of electricity in 2012, and about 98 quadrillion BTU/year (30,000 billion kWh). Efficiency improvements are expected to reduce usage to 15,000 billion kWh by 2050. The United States has the potential of installing 11 million MW of onshore wind power and 4 million MW of offshore wind power, capable of generating over 47,000 billion kWh. The U.S. has the potential of installing 10 to 20 million MW of concentrated solar power in the southwest, capable of generating over 10,000 billion kWh.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Solar_Power">Solar Power</span></h2>
<p>Solar power will be discussed in three distinct varieties . Electric energy is generated by two different methods -Thermal and Photovoltaic. Application is either utility scale for electric grid power generation or much smaller distributed systems which may or may not be integrated into the electric grid. Utility grade systems have well documented generation but distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled. Therefore, quantitative evaluation of distributive solar to the overall US electric power environment has been lacking. Recently, the Energy Information Administration. has begun estimating that contribution.</p>

<p>In 2015, utility scale solar contributed 26.47 G kWh (billion kWh) to the grid with 23.233 G kWh from photovoltaics and 3.24 G kWh from thermal systems. In 2014 and 2015, EIA estimated that distributed solar&gt; generated 9.536 G kWh and 12.141 G kWh respectively.</p>

<p>Prior to 2012, in six southwestern states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) the US Bureau of Land Management owned nearly 98 million acres (an area larger than the state of Montana) that was open to proposals for solar power installations. To streamline consideration of applications, the BLM produced a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). By the subsequent Record of Decision in October 2012, the BLM withdrew 78 percent of its land from possible solar development, leaving 19 million acres still open to applications for solar installations, an area nearly as large as South Carolina. Of the area left open to solar proposals, the BLM has identified 285 thousand acres in 17 highly favorable areas it calls Solar Energy Zones.</p>

According to 2014 state energy data, geothermal energy provided approximately 16 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity—0.31% of the electricity consumed in the U.S. As of May 2007, geothermal electric power was generated in five U.S. states: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah. According to the <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_Energy_Association" title="Geothermal Energy Association">Geothermal Energy Association</a>'s recent report, there were 75 new geothermal power projects underway in 12 states as of May 2007 . This is an increase of 14 projects in an additional three states compared to a survey completed in November 2006.</p>
<p>The most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the <i><a href="/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005" title="Energy Policy Act of 2005">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a></i>. This Act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit, previously available only to wind power projects. It also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">Department of Energy</a>, and gave the Bureau of Land Management new legal guidance and secure funding to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits.</p>
<p>Installed geothermal capacity in megawatts (MW) by state as of February 2013:</p>

<p>The contribution over the last eleven years of geothermal power to the renewable power generation and to the total US power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the geothermal power generation for 2014.</p>



<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Solar_water_heating">Solar water heating</span></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy stated (in 2006) that more than 1.5 million homes and businesses were currently using <a href="/wiki/Solar_water_heating" title="Solar water heating">solar water heating</a> in the United States, representing a capacity of over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of thermal energy generation. It predicted that another 400 MW was likely to be installed over the next 3–5 years.</p>
<p>Assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the United States have adequate access to sunlight, 29 million solar water heaters could be installed.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters can operate in any climate. Performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site, as well as how cold the water coming into the system is. The colder the water, the more efficiently the system operates.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings. Compared to those with electric water heaters, Florida homeowners with solar water heaters save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills, according to the Florida Solar Energy Center.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biomass">Biomass</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">Biomass</a></div>
<p>In 2015, biomass generated 64.19 million megawatt-hours, 1.57% of total US generated electricity. It was the largest source of total renewable energy in the US, and the third-largest renewable source of electrical power in the US, after hydropower and wind.</p>
<p>Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms, such as plants and trees and utilizes wastes or plant matter specifically grown to generate electricity or produce heat. The main advantage of using grown fuels, as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil, is that while they are growing they absorb the near-equivalent in carbon dioxide (an important greenhouse gas) to that which is later released in their burning. Although there is some debate over the net carbon neutrality and near term affects of using the biomass for energy a key difference is the relatively short carbon recycle period of grown biomass (several years or decades) as opposed to the millions of years it took to turn carbon into fossil fuels. With proper conservation and growing techniques biomass can be an important renewable energy source.</p>
<p>Biomass can be utilized for all three major energy needs: electricity, heating/cooling and transportation fuels. However, each usage is distinctly different from the others, especially regarding efficiency - the percentage of energy utilized from the biomass source. Whereas pellets for heating can be up to 90% efficient, bio-electricity plants are comparable to coal power plants, with around 30% efficiency, and biofuels from crops or algae even less.</p>
<p>Biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories: 1) Wood and wood derived fuels including wood/wood waste solids (including paper pellets, railroad ties, utility poles, wood chiips, bark and wood waste solids), wood waste liquids (red liquor, sludge wood, spent sulfite liquor, and other wood based liquids), and black liquor. and, 2) Other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste, landfill gas, sludge waste agricultural byproducts, other biomass solids, other biomass liquids, and other biomass gases (including digester gases, methane, and other biomass gases). The contribution from these two categories over the last ten years of biomass electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total US power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the electric power generation for 2014 and 2015. This shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to fuel availability and needs. |</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biofuel_in_the_United_States" title="Biofuel in the United States">Biofuel in the United States</a></div>
<p>Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">ethanol</a>, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DaimlerChrysler" title="DaimlerChrysler">DaimlerChrysler</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation" title="General Motors Corporation">GM</a> are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately six million E85-compatible vehicles on U.S. roads.</p>
<p>The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date. Flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability. The <i><a href="/wiki/Energy_Independence_and_Security_Act_of_2007" title="Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007">Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007</a></i>, which calls for 15.2 billion US gallons (58,000,000 m) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.</p>
<p>The expanding ethanol and <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels. On the other hand, in 2010, the biofuel industry received $6644 million in federal government support.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wave_Power_in_the_United_States" title="Wave Power in the United States">Wave Power in the United States</a></div>

<p>Wave power in the United States is under development in several locations off the east &amp; west coasts as well as Hawaii. It has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy. Its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such, the power output is currently modest. But major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Renewable_energy_research">Renewable energy research</span></h2>
<p>There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields. Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL), both of which are funded by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> and supported by various corporate partners. Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion while NREL has a budget of $375 million.</p>
<p>Both <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL), have heavily funded solar research programs. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Petroleum" title="British Petroleum">British Petroleum</a> was also heavily invested in solar research programs until 2008 when the company began scaling back its solar operations. The company finally shut down its forty-year-old solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive. The NREL solar program has a budget of around $75 million and develops research projects in the areas of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> (PV) technology, solar thermal energy, and solar radiation. The budget for Sandia’s solar division is unknown, however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory’s $2.4 billion budget. Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years. The Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) at <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina" title="University of North Carolina">University of North Carolina</a> (UNC) has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology. In 2008, researchers at <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water. Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining. In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., a solar development company backed by German corporation <a href="/wiki/Siemens" title="Siemens">Siemens</a>, announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate.</p>
<p>Wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds. Today, both <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> have programs dedicated to wind research. Sandia’s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials, aerodynamics, and sensors. The NREL wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production, reducing their capital costs, and making wind energy more cost effective overall. The Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caltech" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost, size, and environmental impact of wind energy production.</p>
<p>As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> production. On the Federal level, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USDA" title="USDA">USDA</a> conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets. The <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of <a href="/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic ethanol</a>. <a href="/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol" title="Cellulosic ethanol">Cellulosic ethanol</a> has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants. Moreover, some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol. <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research and is also a member of the <a href="/wiki/Joint_BioEnergy_Institute" title="Joint BioEnergy Institute">Joint BioEnergy Institute</a> (JBEI), a research institute founded by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels.</p>
<p>Over $1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the United States. Both the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> have departments dedicated to hydrogen research.</p>
