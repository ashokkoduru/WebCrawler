It is an action agenda for the UN, other <a href="/wiki/Multilateralism" title="Multilateralism">multilateral</a> organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels. The "21" in Agenda 21 refers to the 21st Century. It has been affirmed and had a few modifications at subsequent UN conferences.</p>

<p>The full text of Agenda 21 was made public at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (<a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a>), held in Rio de Janeiro on June 13, 1992, where 178 governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rio.2B5_.281997.29">Rio+5 (1997)</span></h3>
<p>In 1997, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_General_Assembly" title="UN General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda 21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as "uneven" and identified key trends, including increasing <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a>, widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly <a href="/wiki/Resolution_(law)" title="Resolution (law)">Resolution</a> (S-19/2) promised further action.</p>

<p>The first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in <a href="/wiki/Porto_Alegre" title="Porto Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>, Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda 21 was for the environment. They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda 21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/G8" title="G8">G8</a> countries.</p>

<p>In 2012, at the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Sustainable_Development" title="United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development">United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development</a> the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda 21 in their outcome document called "The Future We Want". 180 leaders from nations participated.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Implementation">Implementation</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Commission_on_Sustainable_Development" title="Commission on Sustainable Development">Commission on Sustainable Development</a> acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda 21. The UN Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works "within the context of" Agenda 21.</p>
<p>Implementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.</p>

<p>The implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. These programs are often known as "Local Agenda 21" or "LA21". For example, in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the plan is "Philippines Agenda 21" (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000 cities, towns, and counties in 88 countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda 21 implementation.</p>
<p>In other countries, opposition to Agenda 21's ideas has surfaced to varied extents. In some cases, opposition has been legislated into several States limiting or forbidding the participation and/or funding of local government activities that support Agenda 21.</p>
<p>Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented. In Sweden, for example, all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda 21 initiative.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="National_level">National level</span></h2>

<p>The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda 21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, for example, is a signatory to Agenda 21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to <a href="/wiki/ICLEI" title="ICLEI">ICLEI</a>, an organization that promotes Agenda 21 globally. Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States. European countries generally possess well documented Agenda 21 statuses. France, whose national government, along with 14 cities, is a signatory, boasts nationwide programs supporting Agenda 21. The French activist group Nouvelle Force announced in March 2012 that they viewed Agenda 21 as a "sham".</p>
<p>In Africa, national support for Agenda 21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 <a href="/wiki/Sam_Nujoma" title="Sam Nujoma">Sam Nujoma</a>, who was then President of <a href="/wiki/Namibia" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>, spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda 21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi-arid" title="Semi-arid">semi-arid</a> country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_to_Combat_Desertification" title="United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification">United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification</a> (UNCCD). Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda 21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan African</a> countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda 21 participation in <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North African</a> countries mirrors that of <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda 21 status reports. By contrast, <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s participation in Agenda 21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21 city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda 21 by national-level government.</p>

<p>The national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs, Office of Environmental Policy, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State. A June 2012 poll of 1,300 United States voters by the <a href="/wiki/American_Planning_Association" title="American Planning Association">American Planning Association</a> found that 9% supported Agenda 21, 6% opposed it, and 85% thought they didn't have enough information to form an opinion.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Support">Support</span></h5>
<p>The United States is a signatory country to Agenda 21, but because Agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under <a href="/wiki/Article_Six_of_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Article Six of the United States Constitution">Article Six of the United States Constitution</a>. President <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992, and in the same year Representatives <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi" title="Nancy Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eliot_Engel" title="Eliot Engel">Eliot Engel</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Broomfield" title="William Broomfield">William Broomfield</a> spoke in support of <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda 21 in the United States. Created by a 1993 Executive Order, the President's Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, "Sustainable America: A New Consensus", to the President in early 1996. In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21.</p>
<p>In the United States, over 528 cities are members of <a href="/wiki/ICLEI" title="ICLEI">ICLEI</a>, an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda 21 and Local Agenda 21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of 1,200 cities promoting sustainable development at a local level. The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda 21 status reports. In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said "Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments".</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" title="Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry">Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012, arguing "It would be bad for business" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Opposition">Opposition</span></h5>
<p>During the last decade, opposition to Agenda 21 has increased within the United States at the local, state, and federal levels. The <a href="/wiki/Republican_National_Committee" title="Republican National Committee">Republican National Committee</a> has adopted a resolution opposing Agenda 21, and the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> platform stated that "We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty." Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda 21. <a href="/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> became the first state to prohibit government participation in Agenda 21. Many other states, including <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, are drafting, and close to passing legislation to ban Agenda 21.</p>
<p>Activists, some of whom have been associated with the <a href="/wiki/Tea_Party_movement" title="Tea Party movement">Tea Party movement</a> by <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Huffington_Post" title="The Huffington Post">The Huffington Post</a></i>, have said that Agenda 21 is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_conspiracies_(political)" title="List of conspiracies (political)">conspiracy</a> by the United Nations to deprive individuals of <a href="/wiki/Real_property" title="Real property">property rights</a>. Columnists in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Atlantic" title="The Atlantic">The Atlantic</a></i> have linked opposition to Agenda 21 to the property rights movement in the United States. In 2012 <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Beck" title="Glenn Beck">Glenn Beck</a> co-wrote a <a href="/wiki/Dystopia" title="Dystopia">dystopian</a> novel titled <i>Agenda 21</i> based in part on concepts discussed in the UN plan.</p>
