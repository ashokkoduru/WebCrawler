<p>Engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel, and pulley. Each of these inventions is essentially consistent with the modern definition of engineering.</p>
<p>The term <i>engineering</i> is derived from the word <i>engineer</i>, which itself dates back to 1390, when an <i>engine'er</i> (literally, one who operates an <i>engine</i>) originally referred to "a constructor of military engines." In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, <i>i.e.</i>, a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a <a href="/wiki/Catapult" title="Catapult">catapult</a>). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, <i>e.g.</i>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="United States Army Corps of Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>ingenium</i> (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."</p>
<p>Later, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a> entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of <a href="/wiki/Military_engineering" title="Military engineering">military engineering</a>.</p>

<p>Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. These disciplines concern themselves with differing areas of engineering work. Although initially an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, throughout an engineer's career the engineer may become multi-disciplined, having worked in several of the outlined areas. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Chemical_engineering" title="Chemical engineering">Chemical engineering</a> – The application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as <a href="/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="Oil refinery">petroleum refining</a>, <a href="/wiki/Microfabrication" title="Microfabrication">microfabrication</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fermentation" title="Fermentation">fermentation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" title="Biotechnology">biomolecule production</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" title="Civil engineering">Civil engineering</a> – The design and construction of public and private works, such as <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Airports" title="Airports">airports</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roads" title="Roads">roads</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Railways" title="Railways">railways</a>, water supply and treatment etc.), <a href="/wiki/Bridge" title="Bridge">bridges</a>, dams, and buildings.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">Electrical engineering</a> – The design, study and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_circuit" title="Electrical circuit">electrical circuits</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_generator" title="Electrical generator">generators</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_motor" title="Electric motor">motors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetism" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetic</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electromechanical" title="Electromechanical">electromechanical</a> devices, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_devices" title="Electronic devices">electronic devices</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_circuits" title="Electronic circuits">electronic circuits</a>, <a href="/wiki/Optical_fiber" title="Optical fiber">optical fibers</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optoelectronic_device" title="Optoelectronic device">optoelectronic devices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> systems, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telecommunications" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a>, instrumentation, controls, and <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mechanical_engineering" title="Mechanical engineering">Mechanical engineering</a> – The design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> systems, <a href="/wiki/Aerospace" title="Aerospace">aerospace</a>/<a href="/wiki/Aircraft" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> products, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weapon_systems" title="Weapon systems">weapon systems</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transportation" title="Transportation">transportation</a> products, <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">engines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gas_compressor" title="Gas compressor">compressors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Powertrain" title="Powertrain">powertrains</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kinematic_chain" title="Kinematic chain">kinematic chains</a>, vacuum technology, <a href="/wiki/Vibration_isolation" title="Vibration isolation">vibration isolation</a> equipment, <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mechatronics" title="Mechatronics">mechatronics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these four, a number of other branches are recognized. Historically, <a href="/wiki/Naval_architecture" title="Naval architecture">naval engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mining_engineering" title="Mining engineering">mining engineering</a> were major branches. Other engineering fields sometimes included as major branches are <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing_engineering" title="Manufacturing engineering">manufacturing engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Acoustical_engineering" title="Acoustical engineering">acoustical engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corrosion_engineering" title="Corrosion engineering">corrosion engineering</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instrumentation_and_control" title="Instrumentation and control">Instrumentation and control</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aerospace_engineering" title="Aerospace engineering">aerospace</a>, <a href="/wiki/Automotive_engineering" title="Automotive engineering">automotive</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_engineering" title="Computer engineering">computer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_engineering" title="Electronic engineering">electronic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Petroleum_engineering" title="Petroleum engineering">petroleum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">systems</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audio_engineering" title="Audio engineering">audio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering" title="Software engineering">software</a>, <a href="/wiki/Architectural_engineering" title="Architectural engineering">architectural</a>, <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_engineering" title="Agricultural engineering">agricultural</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biosystems_engineering" title="Biosystems engineering">biosystems</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biomedical_engineering" title="Biomedical engineering">biomedical</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geological_engineering" title="Geological engineering">geological</a>, <a href="/wiki/Textile_manufacturing" title="Textile manufacturing">textile</a>, <a href="/wiki/Industrial_engineering" title="Industrial engineering">industrial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Materials_science" title="Materials science">materials</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_engineering" title="Nuclear engineering">nuclear</a> engineering. These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 Licensed Member institutions of the UK <a href="/wiki/Engineering_Council" title="Engineering Council">Engineering Council</a>.</p>
<p>New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth_Systems_Engineering_and_Management" title="Earth Systems Engineering and Management">Earth Systems Engineering and Management</a> involves a wide range of subject areas including <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineering_studies" title="Engineering studies">engineering studies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environmental science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. A new or emerging area of application will commonly be defined temporarily as a permutation or subset of existing disciplines; there is often gray area as to when a given sub-field warrants classification as a new "branch." One key indicator of such emergence is when major universities start establishing departments and programs in the new field.</p>
<p>For each of these fields there exists considerable overlap, especially in the areas of the application of fundamental sciences to their disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics. As a result, there are many different types of engineering degrees available. In the past, engineering could be divided into four major branches: Mechanical, Chemical, Civil and Electrical, with sub branches of each discipline. Today however, the number of engineering degrees available have increased dramatically.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Practice">Practice</span></h2>
<p>One who practices engineering is called an <a href="/wiki/Engineer" title="Engineer">engineer</a>, and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Professional_Engineer" title="Professional Engineer">Professional Engineer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chartered_Engineer" title="Chartered Engineer">Chartered Engineer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incorporated_Engineer" title="Incorporated Engineer">Incorporated Engineer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ingenieur" title="Ingenieur">Ingenieur</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_Engineer" title="European Engineer">European Engineer</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration#Designated_Engineering_Representative_.28DER.29" title="Federal Aviation Administration">Designated Engineering Representative</a>. In the UK many trades are called "Engineer" including gas, telephone, photocopy, maintenance, plumber-heating, drainage, sanitary, auto mechanic, TV, Refrigerator, electrician, washing machine, TV antenna installer (satellite) and many others.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Methodology">Methodology</span></h2>


<p>Engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find suitable solutions to problems or to make improvements to the status quo. More than ever, engineers are now required to have knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, they keep on learning new material throughout their career.</p>
<p>If multiple options exist, engineers weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. It is usually not enough to build a technically successful product; it must also meet further requirements.</p>
<p>Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, <a href="/wiki/Safety_engineering" title="Safety engineering">safety</a>, marketability, productivity, and <a href="/wiki/Serviceability_(computer)" title="Serviceability (computer)">serviceability</a>. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specifications" title="Specifications">specifications</a> for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.</p>
<p>A general methodology and epistemology of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti. Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.</p>
<p>According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "<i>engineering method</i> is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces, but rather how he goes about it.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Problem_solving">Problem solving</span></h3>


<p>Engineers use their knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empirical_knowledge" title="Empirical knowledge">appropriate experience</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tacit_knowledge" title="Tacit knowledge">tacit knowledge</a> to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_model" title="Mathematical model">mathematical model</a> of a problem allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.</p>
<p>Usually multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different <a href="/wiki/Design_choice" title="Design choice">design choices</a> on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. <a href="/wiki/Genrich_Altshuller" title="Genrich Altshuller">Genrich Altshuller</a>, after gathering statistics on a large number of <a href="/wiki/Patent" title="Patent">patents</a>, suggested that <a href="/wiki/Compromise" title="Compromise">compromises</a> are at the heart of "<a href="/wiki/Level_of_invention" title="Level of invention">low-level</a>" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.</p>
<p>Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: <a href="/wiki/Prototype" title="Prototype">prototypes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scale_model" title="Scale model">scale models</a>, <a href="/wiki/Simulation" title="Simulation">simulations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Destructive_testing" title="Destructive testing">destructive tests</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nondestructive_testing" title="Nondestructive testing">nondestructive tests</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stress_testing" title="Stress testing">stress tests</a>. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.</p>
<p>Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a <a href="/wiki/Factor_of_safety" title="Factor of safety">factor of safety</a> in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.</p>
<p>The study of failed products is known as <a href="/wiki/Forensic_engineering" title="Forensic engineering">forensic engineering</a>, and can help the <a href="/wiki/Product_design" title="Product design">product designer</a> in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bridge_collapse" title="Bridge collapse">bridge collapses</a>, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.</p>

<p>As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business <a href="/wiki/Application_software" title="Application software">application software</a> there are a number of computer aided applications (<a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_technologies" title="Computer-aided technologies">computer-aided technologies</a>) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using <a href="/wiki/Numerical_method" title="Numerical method">numerical methods</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most widely used <a href="/wiki/Design_tool" title="Design tool">design tools</a> in the profession is <a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_design" title="Computer-aided design">computer-aided design</a> (CAD) software like <a href="/wiki/CATIA" title="CATIA">CATIA</a>, <a href="/wiki/Autodesk_Inventor" title="Autodesk Inventor">Autodesk Inventor</a>, DSS <a href="/wiki/SolidWorks" title="SolidWorks">SolidWorks</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pro_Engineer" title="Pro Engineer">Pro Engineer</a> which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with <a href="/wiki/Digital_mockup" title="Digital mockup">digital mockup</a> (DMU) and <a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering" title="Computer-aided engineering">CAE</a> software such as <a href="/wiki/Finite_element_method" title="Finite element method">finite element method analysis</a> or <a href="/wiki/Analytic_element_method" title="Analytic element method">analytic element method</a> allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.</p>
<p>These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of <a href="/wiki/Product_data_management" title="Product data management">product data management</a> software.</p>
<p>There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as <a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing" title="Computer-aided manufacturing">computer-aided manufacturing</a> (CAM) software to generate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CNC" title="CNC">CNC</a> machining instructions; <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing_process_management" title="Manufacturing process management">manufacturing process management</a> software for production engineering; <a href="/wiki/Electronic_design_automation" title="Electronic design automation">EDA</a> for <a href="/wiki/Printed_circuit_board" title="Printed circuit board">printed circuit board</a> (PCB) and circuit <a href="/wiki/Schematic" title="Schematic">schematics</a> for electronic engineers; <a href="/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations" title="Maintenance, repair, and operations">MRO</a> applications for maintenance management; and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Architecture,_engineering_and_construction&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Architecture, engineering and construction (page does not exist)">AEC</a> software for civil engineering.</p>
<p>In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Product_lifecycle_management" title="Product lifecycle management">product lifecycle management</a> (PLM).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_context">Social context</span></h2>


<p>The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are <i><a href="/wiki/Pro_bono" title="Pro bono">pro bono</a></i> engineering and <a href="/wiki/Open_design" title="Open design">open-design</a> engineering.</p>
<p>By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior. Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety. Many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Engineering_society" title="Engineering society">engineering societies</a> have established codes of practice and <a href="/wiki/Engineering_ethics" title="Engineering ethics">codes of ethics</a> to guide members and inform the public at large.</p>
<p>Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a>, the design and use of <a href="/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" title="Sport utility vehicle">sport utility vehicles</a> and the extraction of <a href="/wiki/Fuel_oil" title="Fuel oil">oil</a>. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious <a href="/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility" title="Corporate social responsibility">corporate and social responsibility</a> policies.</p>
<p>Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid. The attainment of many of the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.</p>

<p>All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Engineers_Without_Borders" title="Engineers Without Borders">Engineers Without Borders</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Engineers_Against_Poverty" title="Engineers Against Poverty">Engineers Against Poverty</a></li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Engineering_for_Change" title="Engineering for Change">Engineering for Change</a></li>
<li>Engineering Ministries International</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring. This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status. There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an "image crisis", rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career. Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.</p>

<p><i>Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.</p>
<p>Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".</p>
<p>In the book <i><a href="/wiki/What_Engineers_Know_and_How_They_Know_It" title="What Engineers Know and How They Know It">What Engineers Know and How They Know It</a></i>, Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.</p>

<p>Examples are the use of numerical approximations to the <a href="/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations" title="Navier–Stokes equations">Navier–Stokes equations</a> to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of <a href="/wiki/Fatigue_(material)" title="Fatigue (material)">Miner's rule</a> to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empirical_methods" title="Empirical methods">empirical methods</a> that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.</p>
<p>As stated by Fung <i>et al.</i> in the revision to the classic engineering text <i>Foundations of Solid Mechanics</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Medicine_and_biology">Medicine and biology</span></h3>

<p>The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. <a href="/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">Medicine</a> aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the <a href="/wiki/Human_body" title="Human body">human body</a>, if necessary, through the use of <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a>.</p>

<p>Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, <a href="/wiki/Brain_implant" title="Brain implant">brain implants</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker" title="Artificial pacemaker">pacemakers</a>. The fields of <a href="/wiki/Bionics" title="Bionics">bionics</a> and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.</p>
<p>Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying, and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> with technology. This has led to fields such as <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neural_networks" title="Neural networks">neural networks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fuzzy_logic" title="Fuzzy logic">fuzzy logic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Robot" title="Robot">robotics</a>. There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.</p>
<p>Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empirical" title="Empirical">empirical</a> knowledge is an integral part of both.</p>
<p>Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.</p>
<p>The heart for example functions much like a pump, the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers, the brain produces <a href="/wiki/Signal_(electrical_engineering)" title="Signal (electrical engineering)">electrical signals</a> etc. These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of <a href="/wiki/Biomedical_engineering" title="Biomedical engineering">biomedical engineering</a> that uses concepts developed in both disciplines.</p>
<p>Newly emerging branches of science, such as <a href="/wiki/Systems_biology" title="Systems biology">systems biology</a>, are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Art">Art</span></h3>
<p>There are connections between engineering and art; they are direct in some fields, for example, <a href="/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Landscape_architecture" title="Landscape architecture">landscape architecture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Industrial_design" title="Industrial design">industrial design</a> (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's <a href="/wiki/Faculty_(division)" title="Faculty (division)">Faculty</a> of Engineering); and indirect in others.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago" title="Art Institute of Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, for instance, held an exhibition about the art of <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s aerospace design. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Maillart" title="Robert Maillart">Robert Maillart</a>'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic. At the <a href="/wiki/University_of_South_Florida" title="University of South Florida">University of South Florida</a>, an engineering professor, through a grant with the <a href="/wiki/National_Science_Foundation" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>, has developed a course that connects art and engineering.</p>
<p>Among famous historical figures, <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> is a well-known <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Business_Engineering_and_Engineering_Management">Business Engineering and Engineering Management</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Business_Engineering" title="Business Engineering">Business Engineering</a> deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and <a href="/wiki/Change_management" title="Change management">change management</a>. <a href="/wiki/Engineering_management" title="Engineering management">Engineering management</a> is a specialized field of management concerned with the engineering sector. The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop <a href="/wiki/Industrial_engineering" title="Industrial engineering">industrial engineering</a> skills, knowledge and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. Engineers specializing in change management must have in depth knowledge of the application of <a href="/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology" title="Industrial and organizational psychology">industrial and organizational psychology</a> principles and methods. Professional engineers often train as <a href="/wiki/Certified_management_consultant" title="Certified management consultant">certified management consultants</a> in the very specialized field of <a href="/wiki/Management_consulting" title="Management consulting">management consulting</a> applied to the engineering sector. This work often deals with large scale complex <a href="/wiki/Business_transformation" title="Business transformation">business transformation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Business_process_management" title="Business process management">Business process management</a> initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems. This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_fields">Other fields</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political science</a>, the term <i>engineering</i> has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of <a href="/wiki/Social_engineering_(political_science)" title="Social engineering (political science)">social engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Political_engineering" title="Political engineering">political engineering</a>, which deal with forming <a href="/wiki/Political_structure" title="Political structure">political</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_structure" title="Social structure">social structures</a> using engineering methodology coupled with <a href="/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political science</a> principles. <a href="/wiki/Financial_engineering" title="Financial engineering">Financial engineering</a> has similarly borrowed the term.</p>
