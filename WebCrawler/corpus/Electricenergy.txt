This energy is supplied by the combination of <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" title="Electric current">electric current</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electric_potential" title="Electric potential">electric potential</a> that is delivered by the circuit. At the point that this electric potential energy has been converted to another type of energy, it ceases to be electric potential energy. Thus, all electrical energy is potential energy before it is delivered to the end-use. Once converted from potential energy, electrical energy can always be called another type of energy (heat, light, motion, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Electricity generation</b> is the process of generating electrical energy from other <a href="/wiki/Forms_of_energy" title="Forms of energy">forms of energy</a>. Electrical is a form of energy.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist <a href="/wiki/Michael_Faraday" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>. His basic method is still used today: electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or <a href="/wiki/Homopolar_generator" title="Homopolar generator">disc of copper</a> between the poles of a <a href="/wiki/Magnet" title="Magnet">magnet</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="/wiki/Electric_utility" title="Electric utility">electric utilities</a>, it is the first step in the delivery of electricity to consumers. The other processes, electricity <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">transmission</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_distribution" title="Electric power distribution">distribution</a>, and electrical power storage and recovery using <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage</a> methods are normally carried out by the <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_industry" title="Electric power industry">electric power industry</a>.</p>
<p>Electricity is most often generated at a <a href="/wiki/Power_station" title="Power station">power station</a> by electromechanical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_generator" title="Electrical generator">generators</a>, primarily driven by <a href="/wiki/Heat_engine" title="Heat engine">heat engines</a> fueled by chemical <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> but also by other means such as the <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of flowing water and wind. There are many other technologies that can be and are used to generate electricity such as solar <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a>.</p>
