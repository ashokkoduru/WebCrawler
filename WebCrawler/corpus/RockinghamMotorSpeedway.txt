<p>Rockingham has 13 configurations of track, which can be used for anything from <a href="/wiki/Touring_car_racing" title="Touring car racing">touring cars</a> to <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle_racing" title="Motorcycle racing">motorcycles</a> to <a href="/wiki/Rallying" title="Rallying">rally cars</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Oval_Circuit">The Oval Circuit</span></h3>
<p>The 1.48 mile American-style banked oval circuit is 18.3 metres wide and has a maximum bank angle of 7 degrees and comprises four very distinct corners. Rockingham's oval is unique in the UK and one of only two speedways in Europe. The oval circuit can also be converted to a road course layout for events by positioning temporary chicanes and curves both on the main area and apron of the circuit.</p>
<p>Over the weekend of 20–22 September 2001, the <a href="/wiki/Champ_Car" title="Champ Car">Champ cars</a> came to England for the first time to contest the Rockingham 500, a round of the <a href="/wiki/Champ_Car" title="Champ Car">CART</a> (Championship Auto Racing Teams) Fedex Championship Series. For various reasons the race distance was shortened to 300 km and victory was snatched on the exit of Turn Four of the last lap by <a href="/wiki/Gil_de_Ferran" title="Gil de Ferran">Gil de Ferran</a> driving the <a href="/wiki/Team_Penske" title="Team Penske">Marlboro Team Penske</a> <a href="/wiki/Honda" title="Honda">Honda</a> –powered <a href="/wiki/Reynard" title="Reynard">Reynard</a> 01i at a race average speed of 153.41 mph from <a href="/wiki/Kenny_Br%C3%A4ck" title="Kenny Bräck">Kenny Bräck</a> at the wheel the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Team_Rahal" title="Team Rahal">Team Rahal</a> Lola-Ford Cosworth B1/00, and the <a href="/wiki/Newman/Haas_Racing" title="Newman/Haas Racing">Newman-Haas Racing</a> Lola-Toyota B1/00 driven by <a href="/wiki/Cristiano_da_Matta" title="Cristiano da Matta">Cristiano da Matta</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_International_Super_Sportscar_Circuit_.28ISSC.29">The International Super Sportscar Circuit (ISSC)</span></h3>
<p>The ISSC is 1.94 miles long and between 18.3 and 11 metres wide, with a maximum bank angle of 7 degrees at turn 1. Rockingham's International Super Sportscar Circuit is used by the Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship as well as for most other car race events. The circuit combines long straights, sweeping high-speed bends (including the infamous Turn 1 and Gracelands) with a lower speed, highly technical infield layout. Average lap speeds around the circuit range from 1m 24s in the BTCC to 1m 12s in British F3.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wet_Handling_Facility">Wet Handling Facility</span></h3>
<p>The site has a wet handling area with a kick plate which is used to simulate a variety of driving conditions including ice, rain and slippery wet leaves. These different road conditions are simulated at much slower speeds than in normal driving and in a fully controlled environment. The area is designed to give drivers a greater understanding of the latest ABS, traction control and crash mitigating technologies, and the way that they affect vehicle control.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Construction of Rockingham started late in 1999, with the opening meeting planned for May 2001.</p>
<p>Rockingham Motor Speedway was constructed on a British Steel works <i><a href="/wiki/Brownfield_status" title="Brownfield status">brown field</a></i> site as a banked oval with the intention of bringing the American oval racing across the Atlantic for the first time. The opportunity was taken to use the infield for further circuits.</p>
<p>After almost ten years of planning and 23 months of construction work, Rockingham opened for business on Monday 15 January 2001. It was formally opened by the <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II" title="Elizabeth II">Queen</a> on 26 May 2001.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oval_lap_records">Oval lap records</span></h3>
<p>Rockingham is Europe's fastest banked oval racing circuit, with the lap record for the 1.47 miles (2.37 km) oval set at 24.719 seconds by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Kanaan" title="Tony Kanaan">Tony Kanaan</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Lola_Cars" title="Lola Cars">Lola</a>-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford" title="Ford">Ford</a> <a href="/wiki/Champ_Car" title="Champ Car">Champ Car</a> on 22 September 2001 – an average speed of 215.397 miles per hour (346.648 km/h).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oval_racing">Oval racing</span></h3>
<p>From 2001 to the end of 2007, Rockingham organised and funded American-style Stockcar racing on the oval. Originally known as ASCAR, the series changed name to "Days of Thunder", and then to SCSA (Stock Car Speed Association), before re-branding to the MAC Tools V8 Trophy for its final season in 2007. All cars were UK variants of the American "ASA National-Tour" Howe Racing chassis, running with either Ford, Chevrolet or Pontiac bodies. A change of circuit ownership for 2006 saw the end of promotion and funding for the series, and low grids in 2007 led the organising club (BRSCC) to amalgamate it with a road course series, and eventually to the demise of both championships before the end of 2008.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_activities">Other activities</span></h2>
<p>The circuit is operational 357 days a year and the majority of events that take place at the venue are not motorsport competitions. Events range from manufacturer product launches to dealer training, track days and testing, and corporate and experience days.</p>
