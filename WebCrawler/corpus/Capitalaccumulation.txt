<p><b>Capital accumulation</b> (also termed <b>the accumulation of capital</b>) is the dynamic that motivates the pursuit of profit, involving the investment of money or any financial asset with the goal of increasing the initial monetary value of said asset as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Financial_return" title="Financial return">financial return</a> whether in the form of <a href="/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" title="Profit (accounting)">profit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economic_rent" title="Economic rent">rent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Interest" title="Interest">interest</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royalties" title="Royalties">royalties</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capital_gains" title="Capital gains">capital gains</a>. The process of capital accumulation forms the basis of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, and is one of the defining characteristics of a capitalist <a href="/wiki/Economic_system" title="Economic system">economic system</a>.</p>
<p>In a more broad sense, capital accumulation may refer to the gathering or amassing of any objects of value as judged by one's perceived reproductive interest group.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>

<p>The definition of capital accumulation is subject to controversy and ambiguities, because it could refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <i>net addition</i> to existing wealth</li>
<li>a <i>redistribution</i> of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most often, capital accumulation involves both a net addition and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Redistribution_of_wealth" title="Redistribution of wealth">redistribution of wealth</a>, which may raise the question of who really benefits from it most. If more wealth is produced than there was before, a society becomes richer; the total stock of wealth increases. But if some accumulate capital only at the expense of others, wealth is merely shifted from A to B. It is also possible that some accumulate capital much faster than others. In principle, it is possible that a few people or organisations accumulate capital and grow richer, although the total stock of wealth of society <i>decreases</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Accounting" title="Accounting">accounting</a> <b>capital accumulation</b> is often equated with <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> of profit income or savings, especially in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Real_vs._nominal_in_economics" title="Real vs. nominal in economics">real</a> capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation (see below).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">Capital</a> accumulation refers ordinarily to:</p>
<ul>
<li>real investment in tangible <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>, such as acquisitions, research and development, etc. that can increase the capital flow.</li>
<li>investment in financial assets represented on paper, yielding profit, interest, rent, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royalties" title="Royalties">royalties</a>, fees or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capital_gains" title="Capital gains">capital gains</a>.</li>
<li>investment in <i>non-productive</i> physical assets such as residential real estate or works of art that appreciate in value.</li>
</ul>
<p>and by extension to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a> , i.e., new education and training increasing the skills of the (potential) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labour_force" title="Labour force">labour force</a> which can increase earnings from work.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a> , i.e. the wealth and productive capacity that the people in a society hold in common, rather than as individuals or corporations.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both non-financial and financial capital accumulation is usually needed for <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a>, since additional production usually requires additional funds to enlarge the scale of production. Smarter and more productive organization of production can also increase production without increased capital. Capital can be created without increased investment by inventions or improved organization that increase productivity, discoveries of new assets (oil, gold, minerals, etc.), the sale of property, etc.</p>

<p>A country might for example save and invest 12% of its national income, and then if the capital coefficient is 4:1 (i.e. $4 billion must be invested to increase the national income by 1 billion) the rate of growth of the national income might be 3% annually. However, as <a href="/wiki/Keynesian_economics" title="Keynesian economics">Keynesian economics</a> points out, savings do not automatically mean investment (as liquid funds may be hoarded for example). Investment may also not be investment in <a href="/wiki/Fixed_capital" title="Fixed capital">fixed capital</a> (see above).</p>
<p>Assuming that the turnover of total production capital invested remains constant, the proportion of total investment which just maintains the stock of total capital, rather than enlarging it, will typically increase as the total stock increases. The growth rate of incomes and net new investments must then also increase, in order to accelerate the growth of the capital stock. Simply put, the bigger capital grows, the more capital it takes to keep it growing and the more markets must expand.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Marxian_concept_of_capital_accumulation">Marxian concept of capital accumulation</span></h2>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s economic theory, capital accumulation is the operation whereby profits are reinvested into the economy, increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital was understood by Marx to be expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset <a href="/wiki/Value_(economics)" title="Value (economics)">value</a> in search of additional value (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-value" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a>). This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Over-accumulation_and_crisis">Over-accumulation and crisis</span></h3>
<p>The Marxist analysis of capital accumulation and the development of capitalism identifies systemic issues with the process that arise with expansion of the productive forces. A crisis of <a href="/wiki/Overaccumulation" title="Overaccumulation">overaccumulation</a> of capital occurs when the rate of profit is greater than the rate of new profitable investment outlets in the economy, arising from increasing productivity from a rising organic composition of capital (higher capital input to labor input ratio). This depresses the wage bill, leading to stagnant wages and high rates of unemployment for the working class while excess profits search for new profitable investment opportunities. Marx believed that this cyclical process would be the fundamental cause for the dissolution of capitalism and its replacement by <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, which would operate according to a different economic dynamic.</p>
<p>In Marxist thought, socialism would succeed capitalism as the dominant mode of production when the accumulation of capital can no longer sustain itself due to falling rates of profit in real production relative to increasing productivity. A socialist economy would not base production on the accumulation of capital, instead basing production on the criteria of satisfying human needs and directly producing use-values. This concept is encapsulated in the principle of "<a href="/wiki/Production_for_use" title="Production for use">production for use</a>".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Concentration_and_centralization">Concentration and centralization</span></h3>
<p>According to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of richest capitalists. Marx explains:</p>
<p>"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals.... Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many.... The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, <i>caeteris paribus</i>, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages.... It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_rate_of_accumulation">The rate of accumulation</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian economics</a>, the <i>rate of accumulation</i> is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the <a href="/wiki/Stock_and_flow" title="Stock and flow">stock</a> of capital in an accounting period, (2) the proportion of realized <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-value" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a> or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realized turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestment's (see, e.g., the writings of the economist <a href="/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Kalecki" title="Michał Kalecki">Michał Kalecki</a>).</p>
<p>Other things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about "how much to spend, and how much to save".</p>
<p>In a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_force" title="Labor force">labor force</a>, and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.</p>
<p>In a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation, and luxury consumption. In that case, income from <a href="/wiki/Value_added" title="Value added">value-adding</a> production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment.</p>
<p>As a rule, the larger the total sum of capital invested, the higher the return on investment will be. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow and reinvest at a higher rate of profit or interest. The inverse is also true, and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ernest_Mandel" title="Ernest Mandel">Ernest Mandel</a> emphasized that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Necessary_product" title="Necessary product">necessary product</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Surplus_product" title="Surplus product">surplus product</a>", and (2) the division of the surplus product between <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">consumption</a>. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of <a href="/wiki/Competition" title="Competition">competition</a> among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers, and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors, it also involved social factors and <a href="/wiki/Economic_power" title="Economic power">power</a> relationships.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_circuit_of_capital_accumulation_from_production">The circuit of capital accumulation from production</span></h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realized <a href="/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" title="Profit (accounting)">profit</a> income has been <i>reinvested</i> in capital assets. But the process of capital accumulation in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Production,_costs,_and_pricing" title="Production, costs, and pricing">production</a> has, as suggested in the first volume of Marx's <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Das_Kapital" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a></i>, at least 7 distinct but linked moments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial investment of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a> (which could be borrowed capital) in <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_power" title="Labor power">labor power</a>.</li>
<li>The command over <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-labour" title="Surplus-labour">surplus-labour</a> and its appropriation.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Valorisation" title="Valorisation">valorisation</a> (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.</li>
<li>The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.</li>
<li>The realisation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-value" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a> through output sales.</li>
<li>The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.</li>
<li>The reinvestment of profit income in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these moments do not refer simply to an "economic" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.</p>
<p>In fact Marx argues that the original or <a href="/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital" title="Primitive accumulation of capital">primitive accumulation of capital</a> often occurs through violence, plunder, slavery, robbery, extortion and theft. He argues that the <a href="/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory)" title="Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)">capitalist mode of production</a> requires that people be forced to work in value-adding production for someone else, and for this purpose, they must be cut off from sources of income other than selling their labor power.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Simple_and_expanded_reproduction">Simple and expanded reproduction</span></h3>
<p>In volume 2 of <i>Das Kapital</i>, Marx continues the story and shows that, with the aid of bank <a href="/wiki/Credit_(finance)" title="Credit (finance)">credit</a>, capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities, etc.), commodity capital (tradeable products, real estate etc.), or production capital (<a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> and labor power).</p>
<p>His discussion of the simple and expanded <a href="/wiki/Reproduction_(economics)" title="Reproduction (economics)">reproduction</a> of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Living_standard" title="Living standard">living standard</a>; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, <i>more</i> product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Living_standard" title="Living standard">living standard</a> (a <a href="/wiki/Surplus_product" title="Surplus product">surplus product</a>; the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.</p>
<p>The bourgeois claim there is no <a href="/wiki/Economic_law" title="Economic law">economic law</a> according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in Vol.2, simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realized by Dept. 1—producers of means of production—exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (pg 524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (pg. 514).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ernest_Mandel" title="Ernest Mandel">Ernest Mandel</a> introduced the additional concept of <i>contracted economic reproduction</i>, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de<a href="/wiki/Valorisation" title="Valorisation">valorisation</a>.</p>
<p>Balanced <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a> requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. But markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance, in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a>: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and <a href="/wiki/Protectionism" title="Protectionism">protectionism</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h3>
<p>According to Marx, capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in <a href="/wiki/Confiscation" title="Confiscation">expropriation</a>, both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or "trading up" but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else, without compensation. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/David_Harvey_(geographer)" title="David Harvey (geographer)">David Harvey</a> calls this <a href="/wiki/Accumulation_by_dispossession" title="Accumulation by dispossession">accumulation by dispossession</a>. Marx does not discuss gifts and <a href="/wiki/Grant_(money)" title="Grant (money)">grants</a> as a source of capital accumulation, nor does he analyze taxation in detail (He couldn't, as he died even before completing his major book, Das Kapital). Nowadays the tax take is often so large (i.e., 25-40% of GDP) that some authors refer to <a href="/wiki/State_capitalism" title="State capitalism">state capitalism</a>. This gives rise to a proliferation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tax_havens" title="Tax havens">tax havens</a> to evade tax liability.</p>
<p>The continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade, and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital, because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. But capital accumulation may also confront resistance, when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" title="Strike action">strike</a> by investors or workers, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consumer_resistance" title="Consumer resistance">consumer resistance</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Capital_accumulation_as_social_relation">Capital accumulation as social relation</span></h3>
<p>"Accumulation of capital" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_relations" title="Social relations">social relations</a> (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e., the expansion of the size of the <a href="/wiki/Proletariat" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a> and of the wealth owned by the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>.</p>
<p>This interpretation emphasizes that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> (a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_accumulation" title="Law of accumulation">law of accumulation</a>"). In the first volume of <i>Das Kapital</i> Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to <a href="/wiki/Edward_Gibbon_Wakefield" title="Edward Gibbon Wakefield">Edward Gibbon Wakefield</a>'s theory of colonisation:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"...Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative — the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to <a href="/wiki/Swan_River_(Western_Australia)" title="Swan River (Western Australia)">Swan River</a>, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £50,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, “Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.” Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Capital,_Volume_III" title="Capital, Volume III">the third volume</a> of <i>Das Kapital</i>, Marx refers to the "fetishism of capital" reaching its highest point with <i>interest-bearing capital</i>, because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Capital_accumulation_and_military_wars">Capital accumulation and military wars</span></h2>
<p>Wars typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real <a href="/wiki/War_profiteering" title="War profiteering">war profiteering</a>. The total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.</p>
<p>War destruction can be illustrated by looking at <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant &amp; equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships tanks, etc. were built and then lost or destroyed.</p>
<p>Germany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e., about 1/6. In the <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.</p>
<p>However, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.</p>
<p>Initially, in May 1945, newly installed U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant &amp; equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the USSR. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level, and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.</p>
<p>The first big strike wave in the Ruhr occurred in early 1947—it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. The U.S. appointed military Governor (Newman) however stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was: "no work, no eat". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with Marshal Plan aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marshall_Aid" title="Marshall Aid">Marshall Aid</a> funds were important, but, after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system, much more important was the commitment of the USA to <i>rebuilding</i> German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average real wages remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s, while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_economic_miracle" title="German economic miracle">German economic miracle</a> or <i>"Wirtschaftswunder"</i>.</p>
<p>In Italy, the victorious Allies did three things in 1945: they imposed their absolute military authority; they quickly disarmed the Italian partisans from a very large stock of weapons; and they agreed to a state guarantee of wage payments, as well as a veto on all sackings of workers from their jobs. Although the Italian Communist Party grew very large immediately after the war ended—it achieved a membership of 1.7 million people in a population of 45 million—it was outmaneouvred through a complicated political battle by the Christian Democrats, after three years. In the 1950s, an economic boom began in Italy, at first fueled by internal demand, and then also by exports.</p>
<p>In the United States in World War II the large investments in industrial plant necessitated by the war brought big advantages; but the costs of dead, waste and debt would have never been undertaken by any rational government for the slight advantages.</p>
<p>In modern times, it has often been possible to rebuild physical capital assets destroyed in wars completely within the space of about 10 years, except in cases of severe pollution by <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">chemical warfare</a> or other kinds of irreparable devastation. However, damage to <a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a> has been much more devastating, in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.</p>
