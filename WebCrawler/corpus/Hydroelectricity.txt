<p><b>Hydroelectricity</b> is <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity produced</a> from <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a>. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable electricity</a>, and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the <a href="/wiki/Asia-Pacific" title="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use.</p>
<p>The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatts</a> is 3 to 5 <a href="/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)" title="Penny (United States coin)">U.S. cents</a> per <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatt-hour" title="Kilowatt-hour">kilowatt-hour</a>. With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> than <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> powered energy plants.</p>

<p>Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the mid-1770s, French engineer <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Forest_de_B%C3%A9lidor" title="Bernard Forest de Bélidor">Bernard Forest de Bélidor</a> published <i>Architecture Hydraulique</i> which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late 19th century, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_generator" title="Electrical generator">electrical generator</a> was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics. The growing demand for the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> would drive development as well. In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at <a href="/wiki/Cragside" title="Cragside">Cragside</a> in <a href="/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> by <a href="/wiki/William_Armstrong,_1st_Baron_Armstrong" title="William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong">William George Armstrong</a>. It was used to power a single <a href="/wiki/Arc_lamp" title="Arc lamp">arc lamp</a> in his art gallery. The old <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Robert_Moses_Niagara_Hydroelectric_Power_Station#Origins" title="Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station">Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1</a> near <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Falls" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a> in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Alva_Edison" title="Thomas Alva Edison">Edison</a> hydroelectric power station, the <a href="/wiki/Vulcan_Street_Plant" title="Vulcan Street Plant">Vulcan Street Plant</a>, began operating September 30, 1882, in <a href="/wiki/Appleton,_Wisconsin" title="Appleton, Wisconsin">Appleton, Wisconsin</a>, with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts. By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the U.S. and Canada. By 1889 there were 200 in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. <a href="/wiki/Grenoble" title="Grenoble">Grenoble</a>, France held the <a href="/wiki/International_Exhibition_of_Hydropower_and_Tourism" title="International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism">International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism</a> with over one million visitors. By 1920 as 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Power_Act" title="Federal Power Act">Federal Power Act</a> was enacted into law. The Act created the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Power_Commission" title="Federal Power Commission">Federal Power Commission</a> to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes to include <a href="/wiki/Flood_control" title="Flood control">flood control</a>, <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Navigable" title="Navigable">navigation</a>. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations, such as the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority" title="Tennessee Valley Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (1933) and the <a href="/wiki/Bonneville_Power_Administration" title="Bonneville Power Administration">Bonneville Power Administration</a> (1937) were created. Additionally, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Reclamation" title="Bureau of Reclamation">Bureau of Reclamation</a> which had begun a series of western U.S. irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boulder_Canyon_Project_Act" title="Boulder Canyon Project Act">Hoover Dam</a>. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the <a href="/wiki/Bonneville_Dam" title="Bonneville Dam">Bonneville Dam</a> in 1937 and being recognized by the <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1936" title="Flood Control Act of 1936">Flood Control Act of 1936</a> as the premier federal flood control agency.</p>
<p>Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as <i>white coal</i> for its power and plenty. <a href="/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a>'s initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW <a href="/wiki/Grand_Coulee_Dam" title="Grand Coulee Dam">Grand Coulee Dam</a> in 1942. The <a href="/wiki/Itaipu_Dam" title="Itaipu Dam">Itaipu Dam</a> opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, with over 85% of their electricity.

<p>This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoirs</a> at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir.

<p>Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river. In the United States, run of the river hydropower could potentially provide 60,000 megawatts (80,000,000 hp) (about 13.7% of total use in 2011 if continuously available).</p>

<p>Large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current <a href="/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_stations" title="List of nuclear power stations">largest nuclear power stations</a>.</p>
<p>Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatts</a> are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.</p>
<p>Currently, only four facilities over <span class="nowrap">10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">GW</a></span> (<span class="nowrap">10,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a></span>) are in operation worldwide, see table below.</p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Small">Small</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Small_hydro" title="Small hydro">Small hydro</a></div>
<p>Small hydro is the development of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a> on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatts</a> (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched to 25 MW and 30 MW in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 28% during 2008 from 2005, raising the total world small-hydro capacity to <span class="nowrap">85 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">GW</a></span>. Over 70% of this was in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> (<span class="nowrap">65 GW</span>), followed by <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> (<span class="nowrap">3.5 GW</span>), the United States (<span class="nowrap">3 GW</span>), and <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> (<span class="nowrap">2 GW</span>).</p>


<p>Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Micro_hydro" title="Micro hydro">Micro hydro</a></div>
<p>Micro hydro is a term used for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a> installations that typically produce up to <span class="nowrap">100 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatt" title="Kilowatt">kW</a></span> of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel. Micro hydro systems complement <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaic</a> solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.</p>

It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio for a few homes. Even smaller turbines of 200-300W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only 1 m (3 ft). A Pico-hydro setup is typically <a href="#Run-of-the-river">run-of-the-river</a>, meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties">Properties</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Advantages">Advantages</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Flexibility">Flexibility</span></h4>
<p>Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes. It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants. Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation. Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs. Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Low_cost.2Fhigh_value_power">Low cost/high value power</span></h4>
<p>The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for <a href="/wiki/Dispatchable_generation" title="Dispatchable generation">dispatch later</a> as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to <a href="/wiki/Intermittent_energy_source" title="Intermittent energy source">intermittent energy sources</a>.</p>
<p>Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years. Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.</p>
<p>Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation. Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Suitability_for_industrial_applications">Suitability for industrial applications</span></h4>
<p>While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industrial</a> enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for <a href="/wiki/Aluminium" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a> electrolytic plants, for example. The <a href="/wiki/Grand_Coulee_Dam" title="Grand Coulee Dam">Grand Coulee Dam</a> switched to support <a href="/wiki/Alcoa" title="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> aluminium in <a href="/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington" title="Bellingham, Washington">Bellingham, Washington</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> for American <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In <a href="/wiki/Suriname" title="Suriname">Suriname</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Brokopondo_Reservoir" title="Brokopondo Reservoir">Brokopondo Reservoir</a> was constructed to provide electricity for the <a href="/wiki/Alcoa" title="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> aluminium industry. <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Manapouri_Power_Station" title="Manapouri Power Station">Manapouri Power Station</a> was constructed to supply electricity to the <a href="/wiki/Aluminium" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smelter" title="Smelter">smelter</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comalco" title="Comalco">Tiwai Point</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Reduced_CO2_emissions">Reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</span></h4>
<p>Since hydroelectric dams do not burn fossil fuels, they do not directly produce <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. While some carbon dioxide is produced during manufacture and construction of the project, this is a tiny fraction of the operating emissions of equivalent fossil-fuel electricity generation. One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the <a href="/wiki/Paul_Scherrer_Institute" title="Paul Scherrer Institute">Paul Scherrer Institute</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Stuttgart" title="University of Stuttgart">University of Stuttgart</a> which was funded by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>. According to that study, hydroelectricity produces the least amount of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a> and <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externality</a> of any energy source. Coming in second place was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind</a>, third was <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear energy</a>, and fourth was <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a>. The low <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in <a href="/wiki/Temperate_climate" title="Temperate climate">temperate climates</a>. The above study was for local energy in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> than those in temperate areas.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_uses_of_the_reservoir">Other uses of the reservoir</span></h4>
<p>Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for <a href="/wiki/List_of_water_sports" title="List of water sports">water sports</a>, and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, <a href="/wiki/Aquaculture" title="Aquaculture">aquaculture</a> in reservoirs is common. <a href="/wiki/Multipurpose_reservoir" title="Multipurpose reservoir">Multi-use dams</a> installed for <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> support <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_debate#Disadvantages_of_hydroelectricity" title="Renewable energy debate">Renewable energy debate § Disadvantages of hydroelectricity</a></div>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecosystem_damage_and_loss_of_land">Ecosystem damage and loss of land</span></h4>

<p>Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. The loss of land is often exacerbated by <a href="/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation" title="Habitat fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.</p>
<p>Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks. Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Siltation_and_flow_shortage">Siltation and flow shortage</span></h4>
<p>When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. <a href="/wiki/Siltation" title="Siltation">Siltation</a> can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.</p>
<p>Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. One study from the <a href="/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a> in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Methane_emissions_.28from_reservoirs.29">Methane emissions (from reservoirs)</span></h4>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_impacts_of_reservoirs" title="Environmental impacts of reservoirs">Environmental impacts of reservoirs</a></div>
<p>Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an <a href="/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)" title="Hypoxia (environmental)">anaerobic</a> environment, and forming methane, a <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a>. According to the <a href="/wiki/World_Commission_on_Dams" title="World Commission on Dams">World Commission on Dams</a> report, where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.</p>
<p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boreal_forest" title="Boreal forest">boreal</a> reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Relocation">Relocation</span></h4>
<p>Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Failure_risks">Failure risks</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Dam_failure" title="Dam failure">Dam failure</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_hydroelectric_power_station_failures" title="List of hydroelectric power station failures">List of hydroelectric power station failures</a></div>
<p>Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.</p>
<p>During Typhoon Nina in 1975 <a href="/wiki/Banqiao_Dam" title="Banqiao Dam">Banqiao Dam</a> failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.</p>
<p>The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at <a href="/wiki/Vajont_Dam" title="Vajont Dam">Vajont Dam</a> in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Malpasset_Dam" title="Malpasset Dam">Malpasset Dam</a> failure in <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9jus" title="Fréjus">Fréjus</a> on the <a href="/wiki/French_Riviera" title="French Riviera">French Riviera</a> (Côte d'Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.</p>
<p>Smaller dams and <a href="/wiki/Micro_hydro" title="Micro hydro">micro hydro</a> facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small <a href="/wiki/Kelly_Barnes_Dam" title="Kelly Barnes Dam">Kelly Barnes Dam</a> failed in 1977, causing 39 deaths with the Toccoa Flood, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned the earthen embankment dam failed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_with_other_methods_of_power_generation">Comparison with other methods of power generation</span></h3>
<p>Hydroelectricity eliminates the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flue_gas_emissions_from_fossil_fuel_combustion" title="Flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion">flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion</a>, including pollutants such as <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nitric_oxide" title="Nitric oxide">nitric oxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, dust, and <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">coal mining</a> and the indirect health effects of coal emissions. Compared to <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>, hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure. The creation of <a href="/wiki/Garrison_Dam" title="Garrison Dam">Garrison Dam</a>, for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.</p>
<p>Compared to <a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">wind farms</a>, hydroelectricity power stations have a more predictable load factor. If the project has a storage reservoir, it can generate power when needed. Hydroelectric stations can be easily regulated to follow variations in power demand.</p>

<p>The ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity. Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power. <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> produces 98–99% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources.</p>
<p>A hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the <a href="/wiki/Capacity_factor" title="Capacity factor">capacity factor</a>. The installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings.</p>
