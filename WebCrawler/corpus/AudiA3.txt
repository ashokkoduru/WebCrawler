<p>The original A3 (or <i>Typ</i> 8L) was introduced in the European market in 1996, marking Audi's return to the production of smaller cars following the demise of the <a href="/wiki/Audi_50" title="Audi 50">Audi 50</a> in 1978. This was the first <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Group" title="Volkswagen Group">Volkswagen Group</a> model to use the "PQ34" or "A4" <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile_platform" title="Automobile platform">platform</a>, bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf_Mk4" title="Volkswagen Golf Mk4">Volkswagen Golf Mk4</a>, which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars.</p>
<p>The A3 was initially available only with a three-door <a href="/wiki/Hatchback" title="Hatchback">hatchback</a> body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both <a href="/wiki/Front-wheel_drive" title="Front-wheel drive">front</a> and <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">four-wheel drive</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Inline-four_engine" title="Inline-four engine">inline four-cylinder</a> engines were <a href="/wiki/Transverse_engine" title="Transverse engine">transversely mounted</a>. After the A4, the Audi A3 was the second model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996.</p>
<p>In 1999, Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp), and a 1.9 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turbocharged_Direct_Injection" title="Turbocharged Direct Injection">TDI</a> <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a> with <a href="/wiki/Unit_injector" title="Unit injector">unit injector</a> "Pumpe Düse" (PD) technology and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Variable_geometry_turbocharger" title="Variable geometry turbocharger">variable geometry turbocharger</a>. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T <a href="/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel-drive_system)" title="Quattro (four-wheel-drive system)">quattro</a> used either the 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) or 180 PS (130 kW; 180 hp) engine, and the same <a href="/wiki/Haldex_Traction" title="Haldex Traction">Haldex Traction</a>-based four-wheel-drive system as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_S3" title="Audi S3">Audi S3</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Audi_TT" title="Audi TT">Audi TT</a>. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body.</p>
<p>In late 2000, the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed <a href="/wiki/Manual_transmission" title="Manual transmission">manual</a> gearbox, on the 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) 1.8 Turbo and the new 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) 1.9 TDI.</p>
<p>Audi's <a href="/wiki/Electronic_stability_control" title="Electronic stability control">electronic stability control</a>, traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries.</p>
<p>Although the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Safety">Safety</span></h3>

<p>Euro NCAP rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Their evaluation concluded "the column lock, adjuster lever and bracket presented hazards in the knee impact area for the driver. These could cause high loads on his upper legs and damage to his knees." The A3 also provides almost no protection to pedestrians, giving it two stars out of a possible four.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="S3_.281999.E2.80.932003.29">S3 (1999–2003)</span></h3>




<p>Audi released the A3-derived Audi S3 in 1999, only as a three-door hatchback. The inline-four <a href="/wiki/Multi-valve" title="Multi-valve">20v</a> 1.8 L <a href="/wiki/Turbocharger" title="Turbocharger">turbocharged</a> <a href="/wiki/Petrol_engine" title="Petrol engine">petrol engine</a> come in two versions: 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp) and 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). Early models (1999–2001) had 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp). Later models (2001–2003) had <a href="/wiki/Variable_valve_timing" title="Variable valve timing">variable valve timing</a> and 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). The engine had a maximum of 280 N·m (210 ft·lbf) <a href="/wiki/Torque" title="Torque">torque</a>. This is the first time a small four-cylinder engine has been used in an <a href="/wiki/Audi_S_and_RS_models#S_models" title="Audi S and RS models">Audi S-series</a> car.</p>
<p>Although dubbed <a href="/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel-drive_system)" title="Quattro (four-wheel-drive system)">"quattro"</a>, the S3 uses a different <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">four-wheel drive</a> system. The <a href="/wiki/Haldex_Traction" title="Haldex Traction">Haldex Traction</a> coupling adjusts the bias of torque distribution from the front to rear axle as grip requirements change – most of the time it operates as a front-wheel drive.</p>
<p>The S3 was sold in the Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The S3 was facelifted in 2000, where it was given one-piece <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Headlights" title="Headlights">headlights</a>/indicator units, different front wings, rear lights clusters, and some minor upgrades to interior trim.</p>
<p>Standard features include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Xenon_HID_headlamp" title="Xenon HID headlamp">xenon HID headlamps</a> with high pressure washers and auto levelers, front fog lamps, 17" "Avus" <a href="/wiki/Alloy_wheel" title="Alloy wheel">alloy wheels</a> with 225/45R17 tyres, electrically adjustable <a href="/wiki/Recaro" title="Recaro">Recaro</a> leather seats, climate control, alarm and electronic stability control with <a href="/wiki/Traction_control_system" title="Traction control system">traction control</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Initial_release">Initial release</span></h3>
<p>At the 2003 <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show" title="Geneva Motor Show">Geneva Motor Show</a>, Audi launched the second generation of the A3, the <i>Typ</i> 8P, designed by Gary Telaak during 2000 (however, the final design was frozen in 2001). Originally launched only as a three-door <a href="/wiki/Hatchback" title="Hatchback">hatchback</a> with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile_platform" title="Automobile platform">automobile platform</a> (the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volkswagen_A_platform#PQ35" title="Volkswagen A platform">PQ35</a> platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new <a href="/wiki/Petrol_engine" title="Petrol engine">petrol engines</a> with <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_direct_injection" title="Gasoline direct injection">Fuel Stratified Injection</a> (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6).</p>
<p>In mid-2003, the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp), and a 3.2 L <a href="/wiki/VR6_engine" title="VR6 engine">VR6 engine</a> (for the first time) with 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp). <a href="/wiki/Haldex_Traction" title="Haldex Traction">Haldex Traction</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel-drive_system)" title="Quattro (four-wheel-drive system)">quattro</a> on-demand four-wheel drive, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct-Shift_Gearbox" title="Direct-Shift Gearbox">S-Tronic</a> <a href="/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission" title="Semi-automatic transmission">semi-auto gearbox</a> were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp).</p>
<p>In 2005, the "S line" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 <a href="/wiki/Inline-four_engine" title="Inline-four engine">inline-four</a> TFSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 quattro following.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="A3_Sportback_.282004.E2.80.93.29">A3 Sportback (2004–)</span></h4>
<p>The five-door "Sportback" model was introduced in June 2004. The A3 Sportback is 80 mm (3 in) longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370 litres). It also received the new "single frame" front grille originally introduced in the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">A8 W12</a>, which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="S3_.282006.E2.80.932012.29">S3 (2006–2012)</span></h4>


<p>In August 2006, Audi announced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation—<i>Typ</i> 8P—S3 is powered by a modified and uprated <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Group" title="Volkswagen Group">Volkswagen Group</a>-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_direct_injection" title="Gasoline direct injection">FSI</a> <a href="/wiki/Petrol_engine" title="Petrol engine">petrol engine</a>, with a maximum output of 195 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatt" title="Kilowatt">kW</a> (265 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metric_horsepower" title="Metric horsepower">PS</a>; 261 <a href="/wiki/Horsepower#Brake_horsepower" title="Horsepower">bhp</a>). As with all <a href="/wiki/Audi_S_and_RS_models" title="Audi S and RS models">Audi S models</a>, the design was done in-house by <a href="/wiki/Quattro_GmbH" title="Quattro GmbH">quattro GmbH</a>. The engine features uprated high-performance <a href="/wiki/Piston" title="Piston">pistons</a>, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size (KKK K04) and larger <a href="/wiki/Intercooler" title="Intercooler">intercooler</a>. The most powerful form of this engine, and <a href="/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel-drive_system)" title="Quattro (four-wheel-drive system)">quattro</a> four-wheel drive, makes for a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 5.5 s, and an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct-Shift_Gearbox" title="Direct-Shift Gearbox">S-Tronic</a> automatic transmissions with the S3.</p>
<p>The spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a "quattro" model, the S3 does not employ a <a href="/wiki/Torsen" title="Torsen">Torsen</a> centre differential (as in other common quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish <a href="/wiki/Haldex_Traction" title="Haldex Traction">Haldex Traction</a> system in its on-demand <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">four-wheel drive</a> transmission, due to the <a href="/wiki/Transverse_engine" title="Transverse engine">transverse engine</a> layout.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Safety_2">Safety</span></h4>

<p>Euro NCAP tested a second generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. "A poor result for a new car" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2008_update">2008 update</span></h3>
<p>Audi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2017_update">2017 update</span></h3>
<p>After 4 years of its lifetime, the third-generation Audi A3 got a facelift for the model year 2017. The facelifted model was first unveiled through a set of official images in April 2016. The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were in-line with the automaker's new design philosophy. As a result, the 2017 Audi A3 sedan featured the famous Matrix LED headlamps that were earlier seen in the A8 flagship sedan and the R8 supercar. The front grille was also given a refreshed treatment that made the new A3 look like its elder siblings. Changes on the sides and rear were minimal, with only the taillights getting new LED treatment. There were multiple updates on the interiors as well, with a fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster screen placed behind the steering wheel. Currently on sale in Europe and expected to be released in USA and Asia/Pacific 4 QTR 2016 </p>
