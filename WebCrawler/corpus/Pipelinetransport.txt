<p><b>Pipeline transport</b> is the transportation of goods or material through a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pipe_(material)" title="Pipe (material)">pipe</a>. The latest data, in 2014, gives a total of slightly less than 2,175,000 miles (3,500,000 km) of pipeline in 120 countries of the world. The United States had 65%, Russia had 8%, and Canada had 3%, thus 75% of all pipeline was in three countries.</p>
<p>Pipeline and Gas Journal’s worldwide survey figures indicate that 118,623 miles (190,905 km) of pipelines are planned and under construction. Of these, 88,976 miles (143,193 km) represent projects in the planning and design phase; 29,647 miles (47,712 km) reflect pipelines in various stages of construction. Liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline. Pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum, <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuels</a> - such as oil, natural gas and biofuels - and other fluids including <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slurry" title="Slurry">slurry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a>.

<p>Oil pipelines are made from <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by <a href="/wiki/Pump" title="Pump">pump</a> stations along the pipeline.

<p>It is uncertain when the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a> pipeline was built. Credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed, with competing claims for <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Shukhov" title="Vladimir Shukhov">Vladimir Shukhov</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Branobel" title="Branobel">Branobel</a> company in the late 19th century, and the Oil Transport Association, which first constructed a 2-inch (51 mm) wrought iron pipeline over a 6-mile (9.7 km) track from an oil field in Pennsylvania to a railroad station in <a href="/wiki/Oil_Creek_State_Park#History" title="Oil Creek State Park">Oil Creek</a>, in the 1860s. Pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Refined_oil_products" title="Refined oil products">refined oil products</a> or <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> over land.</p>
<p>Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Small NGL processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of 125 pounds per square inch (860 kPa), can be shipped by rail, truck or pipeline. Propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch. EG: Propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure, 100 psi, give or take depending on temperature, and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than 125 psi (860 kPa) at retail stations. Pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at 250 psi (1,700 kPa).</p>
<p>The distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of NGL processing plants are located in oil fields or close by when a number of pipelines tie into each other from various relatively close fields. Many Bakken Basin oil companies in North Dakota, Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan gas fields separate the NGLs in the field, allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers, eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane.</p>
<p>The most recent major pipeline to start operating in North America, is a TransCanada natural gas line going north across the Niagara region bridges with Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources, into the Canadian province of Ontario as of the fall of 2012, supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in Ontario.</p>

<p>This new US supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to Ontario from western Canada in Alberta and Manitoba, thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer. Compared to shipping by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Railroad" title="Railroad">railroad</a>, pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity. Pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons. Employment on completed pipelines represents only "1% of that of the trucking industry."</p>
<p>To avoid delays and US government regulation, many small, medium and large oil producers in North Dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to Canada to meet up with a Canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east. This allows the Bakken Basin and Three Forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the US. The distance from the biggest oil patch in North Dakota, is <a href="/wiki/Williston,_North_Dakota" title="Williston, North Dakota">Williston, North Dakota</a>, only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the Canada–US border and <a href="/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>. <a href="/wiki/Mutual_fund" title="Mutual fund">Mutual funds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joint_venture" title="Joint venture">joint ventures</a> are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines. In the fall of 2012, the US began exporting <a href="/wiki/Propane" title="Propane">propane</a> to Europe, known as LPG, as wholesale prices there are much higher than in North America.</p>
<p>As more North American pipelines are built, even more exports of LNG, propane, butane, and other natural gas products will occur on all three US coasts. To give insight, North Dakota's oil production has grown to 5 times in late 2012 compared to what it was just 6 years ago creating thousands of good paying long term jobs. North Dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price but pipelines are cheaper. Rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery.</p>
<p>Enbridge in Canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west (Line 9) and expanding it and using it to ship western Canadian bitumen oil eastward. From a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline, it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day. It will bring western oil to refineries in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Quebec and New York by early 2014. New Brunswick will also refine some of this western Canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to Europe from its deep water oil ULCC loading port.</p>
<p>Although pipelines can be built under the sea, that process is economically and technically demanding, so the majority of oil at sea is transported by <a href="/wiki/Tanker_(ship)" title="Tanker (ship)">tanker</a> ships.</p>
<p>The Enbridge <a href="/wiki/Sandpiper_pipeline" title="Sandpiper pipeline">Sandpiper pipeline</a> is proposed to transfer valuable oil from Western North Dakota through northwestern Minnesota. The pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter. It will carry over 300,000 barrels of oil a day with a volatility of 32.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Growth_of_market">Growth of market</span></h3>

<p>The market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008. After faltering in 2009, demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew. By 2012, almost 32,000 miles of North American pipeline were being planned or under construction.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Construction_and_operation">Construction and operation</span></h3>
<p>Oil pipelines are made from <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> tubes with inner diameter typically from 4 to 48 inches (100 to 1,220 mm). Most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about 3 to 6 feet (0.91 to 1.83 m). To protect pipes from <a href="/wiki/Impact_(mechanics)" title="Impact (mechanics)">impact</a>, <a href="/wiki/Abrasion_(mechanical)" title="Abrasion (mechanical)">abrasion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a>, a variety of methods are used. These can include <a href="/wiki/Wood_lagging" title="Wood lagging">wood lagging</a> (wood slats), <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> coating, rockshield, <a href="/wiki/High-density_polyethylene" title="High-density polyethylene">high-density polyethylene</a>, imported sand padding, and padding machines.</p>
<p>Crude oil contains varying amounts of <a href="/wiki/Paraffin_wax" title="Paraffin wax">paraffin wax</a> and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline. Often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using <a href="/wiki/Pigging" title="Pigging">pigging</a>, the practice of using devices known as "pigs" to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline. The devices are also known as "scrapers" or "Go-devils". "Smart pigs" (also known as "intelligent" or "intelligence" pigs) are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents, metal loss caused by corrosion, cracking or other mechanical damage. These devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream, either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line.</p>
<p>For natural gas, pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from 2 to 60 inches (51 to 1,524 mm) in diameter, depending on the type of pipeline. The gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a <a href="/wiki/Thiol" title="Thiol">mercaptan odorant</a> where required by a regulating authority.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ammonia">Ammonia</span></h2>

<p>Pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in Brazil, and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in Brazil and the United States. The main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines, which are not problems with oil and natural gas. Insufficient volumes and cost-effectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Coal_and_ore">Coal and ore</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Slurry_pipeline" title="Slurry pipeline">Slurry pipelines</a> are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines. The material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline; at the far end, the material must be dried.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Submarine_pipeline" title="Submarine pipeline">Submarine pipeline</a></div>
<p>In places, a pipeline may have to cross water expanses, such as small seas, straits and rivers. In many instances, they lie entirely on the seabed. These pipelines are referred to as "marine" pipelines (also, "submarine" or "offshore" pipelines). They are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important. In offshore projects, a distinction is made between a "flowline" and a pipeline. The former is an <i>intrafield</i> pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea <a href="/wiki/Wellhead" title="Wellhead">wellheads</a>, manifolds and the <a href="/wiki/Oil_platform" title="Oil platform">platform</a> <i>within</i> a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an "export pipeline", is used to bring the resource to shore. The construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland, mainly because of wave and current dynamics, along with other <a href="/wiki/Geohazard" title="Geohazard">geohazards</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Functions">Functions</span></h2>
<p>In general, pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Development_and_planning">Development and planning</span></h2>
<p>When a pipeline is built, the construction project not only covers the <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a> work to lay the pipeline and build the pump/compressor stations, it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation.</p>
<p>The pipeline is routed along what is known as a "right of way". Pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open season to determine market interest: Potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipeline's capacity rights. This stage lasts up to two months. If interest in the pipeline is limited, the project does not move forward.</li>
<li>Route (right of way) selection</li>
<li>Pipeline design: The pipeline project may take a number of forms, including the construction of a new pipeline, conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another, or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route. The design process may take up to six months.</li>
<li>Obtaining approval: Once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity, the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies. The process can last up to 18 months, particularly for pipelines that span multiple states.</li>
<li>Surveying the route</li>
<li>Clearing the route</li>
<li>Trenching - Main Route and Crossings (roads, rail, other pipes, etc.)</li>
<li>Installing the pipe</li>
<li>Installing valves, intersections, etc.</li>
<li>Covering the pipe and trench</li>
<li>Testing: Once construction is completed, the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity. These may include hydrostatic testing and line packing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Russia has "Pipeline Troops" as part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rear_Services" title="Rear Services">Rear Services</a>, who are trained to build and repair pipelines. Russia is the only country to have Pipeline Troops.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Operation">Operation</span></h2>
<p>Field devices are instrumentation, data gathering units and communication systems. The field <a href="/wiki/Instrumentation" title="Instrumentation">Instrumentation</a> includes flow, pressure and temperature gauges/transmitters, and other devices to measure the relevant data required. These instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations, such as injection or delivery stations, pump stations (liquid pipelines) or compressor stations (gas pipelines), and block valve stations.</p>
<p>The information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Remote_Terminal_Unit" title="Remote Terminal Unit">Remote Terminal Units</a> (RTU) that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems, such as satellite channels, microwave links, or cellular phone connections.</p>
<p>Pipelines are controlled and operated remotely, from what is usually known as the "Main Control Room". In this center, all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database. The data is received from multiple RTUs along the pipeline. It is common to find RTUs installed at every station along the pipeline.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/SCADA" title="SCADA">SCADA</a> system at the Main Control Room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or <a href="/wiki/SCADA#Human_Machine_Interface" title="SCADA">Human Machine Interface</a>, showing the operational conditions of the pipeline. The operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line, as well as send operational commands (open/close valves, turn on/off compressors or pumps, change setpoints, etc.) through the SCADA system to the field.</p>
<p>To optimize and secure the operation of these assets, some pipeline companies are using what is called "Advanced Pipeline Applications", which are software tools installed on top of the SCADA system, that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection, leak location, batch tracking (liquid lines), pig tracking, composition tracking, predictive modeling, look ahead modeling, and operator training.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Components">Components</span></h3>

<p>Pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location. The main elements of a pipeline system are:</p>






<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Leak_detection_systems">Leak detection systems</span></h3>
<p>Since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country, it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets, and the population and environment where these pipelines run.</p>
<p>Pipeline companies face government regulation, environmental constraints and social situations. Government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation, operator training requirements, pipeline facilities, technology and applications required to ensure operational safety. For example, in the State of Washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less. Social factors also affect the operation of pipelines. Product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies. In this case, the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow, with a high expectation for location accuracy.</p>
<p>Various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines, from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance. The most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is Computational Pipeline Monitoring or CPM. CPM takes information from the field related to pressures, flows, and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported. Once the estimation is completed, the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation, which may be related to a leak.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute" title="American Petroleum Institute">American Petroleum Institute</a> has published several articles related to the performance of CPM in liquids pipelines. The API Publications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RAM 1130 – Computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines</li>
<li>API 1155 – Evaluation methodology for software based leak detection systems</li>
<li>API 1149 – Pipeline variable uncertainties &amp; their effects on leak detectability</li>
</ul>
<p>Where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway, it is usually enclosed in a protective casing. This casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances, and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks. The <i>casing vent</i>, a pipe protruding from the ground, often doubles as a warning marker called a <i>casing vent marker</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Implementation">Implementation</span></h2>
<p>As a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases underground. However, in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_bridge" title="Pipeline bridge">pipeline bridge</a>. Pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead. Pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as Trans-Alaska-Pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Maintenance">Maintenance</span></h2>
<p>Maintenance of pipelines includes checking <a href="/wiki/Cathodic_protection" title="Cathodic protection">cathodic protection</a> levels for the proper range, surveillance for construction, erosion, or leaks by foot, land vehicle, boat, or air, and running cleaning pigs, when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive.</p>
<p>US pipeline maintenance rules are covered in <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations" title="Code of Federal Regulations">Code of Federal Regulations</a>(CFR) sections, 49 CFR 192 for natural gas pipelines, and 49 CFR 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulation">Regulation</span></h2>

<p>In the US, onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_and_Hazardous_Materials_Safety_Administration" title="Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration">Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration</a> (PHMSA). Certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Minerals_Management_Service" title="Minerals Management Service">Minerals Management Service</a> (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada–US border, by the <a href="/wiki/National_Energy_Board" title="National Energy Board">National Energy Board</a> (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a>. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_coating" title="Industrial coating">coating</a> in conjunction with <a href="/wiki/Cathodic_protection" title="Cathodic protection">cathodic protection</a> and technology to monitor the pipeline. Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only external protection.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pipelines_and_geopolitics">Pipelines and geopolitics</span></h2>

They connect to issues of <a href="/wiki/Geopolitics" title="Geopolitics">geopolitics</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_security" title="International security">international security</a> as well, and the construction, placement, and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">state</a> interests and actions. A notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009, wherein <a href="/wiki/2009_Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_dispute" title="2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute">a dispute</a> between <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis. Russian state-owned gas company <a href="/wiki/Gazprom" title="Gazprom">Gazprom</a> cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine after talks between it and the Ukrainian government fell through. In addition to cutting off supplies to Ukraine, Russian gas flowing through Ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southeastern_Europe" title="Southeastern Europe">Southeastern Europe</a> and some supplies to <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>—was cut off, creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on Russian gas as fuel.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hazard_identification">Hazard identification</span></h2>
<p>Because the <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> fraction of <a href="/wiki/Dilbit" title="Dilbit">dilbit</a> typically comprises <a href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound" title="Volatile organic compound">volatile</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aromatics" title="Aromatics">aromatics</a> like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Naptha" title="Naptha">naptha</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benzene" title="Benzene">benzene</a>, reasonably rapid carrier <a href="/wiki/Vaporization" title="Vaporization">vaporization</a> can be expected to follow an above-ground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viscous" title="Viscous">viscous</a> residue that is slow to migrate. Effective protocols to minimize exposure to <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> vapours are well-established, and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier (e.g. a series of torrential downpours).</p>
<p>The Keystone XL extension is designed to be buried under four feet of soil, which will hinder post-spill vaporization of the carrier fraction. Diluent and bitumen will migrate at different rates, depending on the temperature- and composition of the surrounding soils, but separation will take place more slowly as the aromatics diffuse through sediment rather than through air.</p>
<p>The introduction of <a href="/wiki/Benzene" title="Benzene">benzene</a> and other volatile organic compounds (collectively <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BTEX" title="BTEX">BTEX</a>) to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak. Particularly if followed by rain, a pipeline breach would result in BTEX <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_(chemistry)" title="Dissolution (chemistry)">dissolution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium" title="Chemical equilibrium">equilibration</a> of benzene in water, followed by <a href="/wiki/Percolation" title="Percolation">percolation</a> of the admixture into the aquifer. Benzene can cause many <a href="/wiki/Benzene#Health_effects" title="Benzene">health problems</a> and is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carcinogenic" title="Carcinogenic">carcinogenic</a> with EPA <a href="/wiki/Maximum_Contaminant_Level" title="Maximum Contaminant Level">Maximum Contaminant Level</a> (MCL) set at 5 μg/L for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potable_water" title="Potable water">potable water</a>. Although it is not well studied, single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis. Additionally, the exposure of livestock, mainly cattle, to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues, such as <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxicity" title="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</a>, fetal damage and fatal poisoning.</p>
<p>The entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach. Pooled petroleum is unambiguous, readily spotted, and indicates the location of required repairs. Because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment, gaps between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sensors" title="Sensors">sensors</a>, and data that requires interpretation, small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected</p>
<p>Pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks. Buried pipes draw fewer complaints. They are <a href="/wiki/Thermal_insulation" title="Thermal insulation">insulated</a> from extremes in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ambient_temperature" title="Ambient temperature">ambient</a> temperature, they are shielded from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_rays" title="Ultraviolet rays">ultraviolet rays</a>, and they are less exposed to <a href="/wiki/Photodegradation" title="Photodegradation">photodegradation</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Exposure">Exposure</span></h2>
<p>Previous work has shown that a 'worst-case exposure scenario' can be limited to a specific set of conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off <a href="/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure" title="Standard operating procedure">SOP</a> developed by TransCanada, the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely. Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the <a href="/wiki/Detection_limit" title="Detection limit">limit of detection</a> and go unnoticed for extended periods of time. Leak detection is monitored through a <a href="/wiki/SCADA" title="SCADA">SCADA</a> system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (&lt;1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive spill. Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Olfactory" title="Olfactory">olfactory</a> inspection, aerial surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies. It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval, however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection. Benzene typically makes up 0.1 – 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" title="Volatility (chemistry)">volatility</a> and dissolution based on environmental factors.</p>
<p>Even with pipeline leak volumes within SCADA detection limits, sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions, or other problems. The <a href="/wiki/Enbridge" title="Enbridge">Enbridge</a> Line 6B <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enbridge_oil_spill" title="Enbridge oil spill">crude oil pipeline failure</a> in <a href="/wiki/Marshall,_Michigan" title="Marshall, Michigan">Marshall, Michigan</a> on July 25, 2010 was thought by operators in Edmonton to be from column separation of the <a href="/wiki/Dilbit" title="Dilbit">dilbit</a> in that pipeline. The leak in wetlands along the Kalamazoo River was only confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in Michigan.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spill_frequency-volume">Spill frequency-volume</span></h3>
<p>Although the <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_and_Hazardous_Materials_Safety_Administration" title="Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration">Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration</a> (PHMSA) has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills, TransCanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design, operation, and safety. Whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates. Given that the pipeline crosses 247 miles of the Ogallala Aquifer, or 14.5% of the entire pipeline length, and the 50-year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11 – 91 spills, approximately 1.6 – 13.2 spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer. An estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer, each lasting 14 days, results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline. In the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario,’ the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5% of max flow-rate for 14 days has been estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil. According to PHMSA’s incident database, only 0.5% of all spills in the last 10 years were &gt;10,000 barrels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Benzene_fate_and_transport">Benzene fate and transport</span></h3>

<p>Benzene is considered a light <a href="/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon" title="Aromatic hydrocarbon">aromatic hydrocarbon</a> with high solubility and high volatility. It is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene, so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil (1% weight by volume) would not volatilize before equilibrating with water. Using the octanol-water partition coefficient and a 100-year precipitation event for the area, a worst-case estimate of 75 mg/L of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer. The actual movement of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plume_(hydrodynamics)" title="Plume (hydrodynamics)">plume</a> through <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> systems is not well described, although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the Ogallala Aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the MCL. The Final Environmental Impact Statement from the State Department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Previous_dilbit_spill_remediation_difficulties">Previous dilbit spill remediation difficulties</span></h3>
<p>One of the major concerns about <a href="/wiki/Dilbit" title="Dilbit">dilbit</a> is the difficulty in cleaning it up. Enbridge's Line 6B, a 30-inch crude oil pipeline, ruptured in Marshall, Michigan on July 25, 2010, mentioned above, spilled at least 843,000 gallons of dilbit. After detection of the leak, booms and vacuum trucks were deployed. Heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams, and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained. Remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the Kalamazoo River system. However, oil was still being found in affected waters in October 2012.</p>
