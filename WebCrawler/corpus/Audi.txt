<p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (<a href="/wiki/Horch" title="Horch">Horch</a> and the <i>Audiwerke</i>) founded by engineer <a href="/wiki/August_Horch" title="August Horch">August Horch</a>; and two other manufacturers (<a href="/wiki/DKW" title="DKW">DKW</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wanderer_(car)" title="Wanderer (car)">Wanderer</a>), leading to the foundation of <a href="/wiki/Auto_Union" title="Auto Union">Auto Union</a> in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> from <a href="/wiki/Daimler-Benz" title="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a>. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Audi_F103" title="Audi F103">Audi F103</a> series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with <a href="/wiki/NSU_Motorenwerke" title="NSU Motorenwerke">NSU Motorenwerke</a> in 1969, thus creating the present day form of the company.</p>
<p>The company name is based on the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> translation of the surname of the founder, <a href="/wiki/August_Horch" title="August Horch">August Horch</a>. "Horch", meaning "listen" in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_(language)" title="German (language)">German</a>, becomes "audi" in Latin.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Birth_of_the_company_and_its_name">Birth of the company and its name</span></h3>
<p>Originally in 1885, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobile</a> company Wanderer was established, later becoming a branch of Audi AG. Another company, NSU, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later supplied the chassis for <a href="/wiki/Gottlieb_Daimler" title="Gottlieb Daimler">Gottlieb Daimler</a>'s four-wheeler.</p>
<p>On 14 November 1899, <a href="/wiki/August_Horch" title="August Horch">August Horch</a> (1868–1951) established the company <b>A. Horch &amp; Cie.</b> in the <a href="/wiki/Ehrenfeld,_Cologne" title="Ehrenfeld, Cologne">Ehrenfeld</a> district of <a href="/wiki/Cologne" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>. Three years later in 1902 he moved with his company to <a href="/wiki/Reichenbach_im_Vogtland" title="Reichenbach im Vogtland">Reichenbach im Vogtland</a>. On May, 10th, 1904 he founded the <b>August Horch &amp; Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG</b>, a joint-stock company in <a href="/wiki/Zwickau" title="Zwickau">Zwickau</a> (State of <a href="/wiki/Saxony" title="Saxony">Saxony</a>).</p>
<p>After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in Zwickau on 16 July 1909, his second company, the <b>August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH</b>. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement. The German <a href="/wiki/Reichsgericht" title="Reichsgericht">Reichsgericht</a> (Supreme Court) in Leipzig, eventually determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.</p>

<p>Since August Horch was banned from using "Horch" as a trade name in his new car business, he called a meeting with close business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau, Germany. At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, "Father – <i><a href="/wiki/Audi_alteram_partem" title="Audi alteram partem">audiatur et altera pars</a></i>... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it <i>audi</i> instead of <i>horch</i>?" "Horch!" in German means "Hark!" or "hear", which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form of "audire" – "to listen" – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting. On 25 April 1910 the <b>Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau</b> (from 1915 on <b>Audiwerke AG Zwickau</b>) was entered in the company's register of Zwickau registration court.</p>
<p>The first Audi automobile, the <a href="/wiki/Audi_Type_A" title="Audi Type A">Audi Type A</a> 10/22 hp (16 kW) Sport-Phaeton, was produced in the same year, followed by the successor <a href="/wiki/Audi_Type_B" title="Audi Type B">Type B</a> 10/28PS in the same year.</p>
<p>Audi started with a 2,612 cc <a href="/wiki/Inline-four_engine" title="Inline-four engine">inline-four engine</a> model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model, as well as 4,680 cc and 5,720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. The first <a href="/wiki/Straight-six_engine" title="Straight-six engine">six-cylinder</a> model Type M, 4,655 cc appeared in 1924.</p>
<p>August Horch left the <i>Audiwerke</i> in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport, but he was still involved with Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921, Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present a production car, the Audi Type K, with left-handed drive. Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_merger_of_the_four_companies_under_the_logo_of_four_rings">The merger of the four companies under the logo of four rings</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Auto_Union" title="Auto Union">Auto Union</a></div>
<p>In August 1928, <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B8rgen_Skafte_Rasmussen" title="Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen">Jørgen Rasmussen</a>, the owner of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dampf-Kraft-Wagen" title="Dampf-Kraft-Wagen">Dampf-Kraft-Wagen</a> (DKW), acquired the majority of shares in Audiwerke AG. In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the U.S. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile_manufacturer" title="Automobile manufacturer">automobile manufacturer</a> <a href="/wiki/Rickenbacker_(car)" title="Rickenbacker (car)">Rickenbacker</a>, including the manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines. These engines were used in <i>Audi Zwickau</i> and <i>Audi Dresden</i> models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six-cylinder and four-cylinder (<a href="/wiki/Audi_Type_P" title="Audi Type P">the "four"</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Peugeot" title="Peugeot">Peugeot</a> engine) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.</p>
<p>In 1932, Audi merged with <a href="/wiki/Horch" title="Horch">Horch</a>, DKW, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wanderer_(car)" title="Wanderer (car)">Wanderer</a>, to form <a href="/wiki/Auto_Union" title="Auto Union">Auto Union</a> AG, <a href="/wiki/Chemnitz" title="Chemnitz">Chemnitz</a>. It was during this period that the company offered the <a href="/wiki/Audi_Front" title="Audi Front">Audi Front</a> that became the first European car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. It used a powertrain shared with the Wanderer, but turned 180-degrees, so that the drive shaft faced the front.</p>
<p>Before <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. This badge was used, however, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.</p>
<p>Reflecting the economic pressures of the time, Auto Union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s, so that by 1938 the company's DKW brand accounted for 17.9% of the German car market, while Audi held only 0.1%. After the final few Audis were delivered in 1939 the "Audi" name disappeared completely from the new car market for more than two decades.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-World_War_II">Post-World War II</span></h3>

<p>Like most German manufacturing, at the onset of World War II the Auto Union plants were retooled for military production, and were a target for allied bombing during the war which left them damaged.</p>
<p>Overrun by the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Army" title="Soviet Army">Soviet Army</a> in 1945, on the orders of the Soviet Union military administration the factories were dismantled as part of <a href="/wiki/War_reparations" title="War reparations">war reparations</a>. Following this, the company's entire assets were expropriated without compensation. On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register. These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany's Auto Union AG. The remains of the Audi plant of Zwickau became the <a href="/wiki/Volkseigener_Betrieb" title="Volkseigener Betrieb">VEB</a> (for "People Owned Enterprise") <a class="extiw" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobilwerk_Zwickau" title="de:Automobilwerk Zwickau">Automobilwerk Zwickau</a> or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).</p>
<p>With no prospect of continuing production in Soviet controlled East Germany, Auto Union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>. A site was chosen in <a href="/wiki/Ingolstadt" title="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bavaria" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> to start a spare parts operation in late 1945, which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed Auto Union in 1949.</p>
<p>The former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949. These DKW models were renamed to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IFA_F8" title="IFA F8">IFA F8</a> and <a href="/wiki/IFA_F9" title="IFA F9">IFA F9</a> and were similar to the West German versions. West and East German models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke engines. The Zwickau plant manufactured the infamous <a href="/wiki/Trabant" title="Trabant">Trabant</a> until 1991, when it came under Volkswagen control—effectively bringing it under the same umbrella as Audi since 1945.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Auto_Union_unit">New Auto Union unit</span></h3>
<p>A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt, Bavaria with loans from the Bavarian state government and <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Plan" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> aid. The reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued DKW's tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines. This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the <a href="/wiki/DKW_Schnellaster" title="DKW Schnellaster">DKW F89 L</a> at Ingolstadt. The Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles: for manufacturing the company's <a href="/wiki/DKW_F89" title="DKW F89">first post-war mass-market passenger car</a> plant capacity in <a href="/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf" title="Düsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> was rented from <a href="/wiki/Rheinmetall" title="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall-Borsig</a>. It was only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor that funds became available for construction of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.</p>
<p>In 1958, in response to pressure from <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Flick" title="Friedrich Flick">Friedrich Flick</a>, then their largest single shareholder, <a href="/wiki/Daimler-Benz" title="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of Daimler-Benz's interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union's, the company's aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Opel" title="Opel">Opel</a>. The decision to dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability. Ironically, by the time they sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or DKWs, but using the "Audi" name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.</p>
<p>In 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the Düsseldorf factory which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_1" title="Volkswagen Type 1">Volkswagen Beetles</a> per year. Two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the <a href="/wiki/DKW_F102" title="DKW F102">DKW F102</a> was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a <a href="/wiki/Facelift_(automotive)" title="Facelift (automotive)">facelift</a> for the car's front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology, and having classified the model internally as the <a href="/wiki/Audi_F103" title="Audi F103">F103</a>, sold it simply as the "Audi." Later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the Ingolstadt assembly plant - to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings. Then VW chief <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Nordhoff" title="Heinrich Nordhoff">Heinz Nordhoff</a> explicitly forbade Auto Union from any further product development. Fearing that the Volkswagen had no long term ambition for the Audi brand, Auto Union engineers under the leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first <a href="/wiki/Audi_100" title="Audi 100">Audi 100</a> in secret, without Nordhoff's knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype, Nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched in 1968, went on to be a huge success. With this, the resurrection of the Audi brand was now complete, this being followed by the first generation <a href="/wiki/Audi_80#B1_.281972.E2.80.9378.29" title="Audi 80">Audi 80</a> in 1972, which would in turn provide a template for VW's new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward.</p>

<p>In 1969, Auto Union merged with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NSU_Motorenwerke_AG" title="NSU Motorenwerke AG">NSU</a>, based in <a href="/wiki/Neckarsulm" title="Neckarsulm">Neckarsulm</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. In the 1950s, NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the <a href="/wiki/NSU_Prinz" title="NSU Prinz">NSU Prinz</a>, the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Wankel" title="Felix Wankel">Felix Wankel</a>. In 1967, the new <a href="/wiki/NSU_Ro_80" title="NSU Ro 80">NSU Ro 80</a> was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety. However, teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models <a href="/wiki/Audi_A6" title="Audi A6">A6</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">A8</a>. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the <a href="/wiki/Quattro_GmbH" title="Quattro GmbH">quattro GmbH</a>, a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi high-performance models: the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_R8_(road_car)" title="Audi R8 (road car)">R8</a> and the <b>"RS"</b> model range.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_era">Modern era</span></h3>
<p>The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as <b>Audi NSU Auto Union AG</b>, with its headquarters based at NSU's Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year. That same year, the mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VW_K70" title="VW K70">K70</a>, originally intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic <a href="/wiki/NSU_Ro_80" title="NSU Ro 80">NSU Ro 80</a>, was instead launched as a Volkswagen.</p>
<p>After the launch of the <a href="/wiki/Audi_100" title="Audi 100">Audi 100</a> of 1968, the <a href="/wiki/Audi_80" title="Audi 80">Audi 80</a>/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973 <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Passat" title="Volkswagen Passat">Volkswagen Passat</a>) followed in 1972 and the <a href="/wiki/Audi_50" title="Audi 50">Audi 50</a> (later rebadged as the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Polo" title="Volkswagen Polo">Volkswagen Polo</a>) in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf" title="Volkswagen Golf">Golf/Polo</a> concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car. Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (progenitors of the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A4" title="Audi A4">A4</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audi_A6" title="Audi A6">A6</a>, respectively) became the company's biggest sellers, whilst little investment was made in the fading NSU range; the <a href="/wiki/NSU_Prinz" title="NSU Prinz">Prinz</a> models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NSU_Ro80" title="NSU Ro80">NSU Ro80</a> went out of production in 1977, spelling the effective end of the NSU brand. Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, any by the appearance of the second generation C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant. Neckarsulm from that point onward would produce Audi's higher end models.</p>
<p>The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=J%C3%B6rg_Bensinger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jörg Bensinger (page does not exist)">Jörg Bensinger</a> was accepted to develop the <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">four-wheel drive</a> technology in <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Iltis" title="Volkswagen Iltis">Iltis</a> military vehicle for an Audi performance car and <a href="/wiki/Rallying" title="Rallying">rally</a> racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was named the "<a href="/wiki/Audi_Quattro" title="Audi Quattro">Audi Quattro</a>", a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turbo" title="Turbo">turbocharged</a> coupé which was also the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent <a href="/wiki/All-wheel_drive" title="All-wheel drive">all-wheel drive</a> through a centre <a href="/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)" title="Differential (mechanical device)">differential</a>. Commonly referred to as the "Ur-Quattro" (the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proto-World_language" title="Proto-World language">Ur-</a>" prefix is a German <a href="/wiki/Augmentative" title="Augmentative">augmentative</a> used, in this case, to mean "original" and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's <a href="/wiki/Audi_S4" title="Audi S4">S4</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audi_S6" title="Audi S6">S6</a> Sport Saloons, as in "UrS4" and "UrS6"), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.</p>
<p>In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's official name was now shortened to simply <b>Audi AG</b>. At the same time the company's headquarters moved back to Ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries; <i>Auto Union GmbH</i> and <i>NSU GmbH</i>, were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies (the exception being Horch, which had been retained by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi's heritage operations.</p>

<p>In 1986, as the Passat-based <a href="/wiki/Audi_80" title="Audi 80">Audi 80</a> was beginning to develop a kind of "grandfather's car" image, the <i>type 89</i> was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_90" title="Audi 90">Audi 90</a>, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.</p>
<p>In the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and maintain several world records, such as top speed endurance. This effort was in-line with the company's heritage from the 1930s racing era <a href="/wiki/Silver_Arrows" title="Silver Arrows">Silver Arrows</a>.</p>
<p>Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers <a href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz" title="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a href="/wiki/BMW" title="BMW">BMW</a>. This began with the release of the <a href="/wiki/Audi_V8" title="Audi V8">Audi V8</a> in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.</p>
<p>By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder <a href="/wiki/Audi_80" title="Audi 80">Audi 90</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audi_100" title="Audi 100">Audi 100</a>, the turbocharged <a href="/wiki/Audi_100" title="Audi 100">Audi 200</a> and the Audi V8. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines.</p>
<p>Although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8L <a href="/wiki/V6_engine" title="V6 engine">V6 engine</a>. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines, in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saloon_(automobile)" title="Saloon (automobile)">Saloon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coup%C3%A9" title="Coupé">Coupé</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cabriolet_(automobile)" title="Cabriolet (automobile)">Cabriolet</a> body styles.</p>
<p>The five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a <a href="/wiki/Turbocharger" title="Turbocharger">turbocharged</a> 230 hp (170 kW) version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the <a href="/wiki/Audi_Quattro#Sport_Quattro" title="Audi Quattro">Sport Quattro</a>. It was fitted to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_Coup%C3%A9" title="Audi Coupé">Audi Coupé</a>, and named the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_S2" title="Audi S2">S2</a> and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the <a href="/wiki/Audi_S4" title="Audi S4">S4</a>. These two models were the beginning of the mass-produced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_S_models" title="Audi S models">S series</a> of performance cars.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Audi_5000_unintended_acceleration_allegations">Audi 5000 unintended acceleration allegations</span></h3>
<p>Sales in the United States fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_5000" title="Audi 5000">Audi 5000</a> models associated with reported incidents of <a href="/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration" title="Sudden unintended acceleration">sudden unintended acceleration</a> linked to six deaths and 700 accidents. At the time, NHTSA was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power.</p>
<p>A <i><a href="/wiki/60_Minutes" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> report aired 23 November 1986, featuring interviews with six people who had sued Audi after reporting unintended acceleration, showing an Audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the brake pedal was pushed. Subsequent investigation revealed that <i>60 Minutes</i> had engineered the failure – fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor, linked via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmission.</p>

<p>Audi contended, prior to findings by outside investigators, that the problems were caused by driver error, specifically pedal misapplication. Subsequently, the <a href="/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the <i>60 Minutes</i> report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals. CBS did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies, but did acknowledge the similar results of another study.</p>
<p>In a review study published in 2012, NHTSA summarized its past findings about the Audi unintended acceleration problems: "Once an unintended acceleration had begun, in the Audi 5000, due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system (producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g), pedal misapplication resulting from panic, confusion, or unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident."</p>
<p>This summary is consistent with the conclusions of NHTSA's most technical analysis at the time: "Audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g [which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car]. These accelerations could not be the sole cause of [(long-duration) sudden acceleration incidents (SAI)], but might have triggered some SAIs by startling the driver. The defective idle-stabilization system performed a type of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_throttle_control" title="Electronic throttle control">electronic throttle control</a>. Significantly: multiple "intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded ... and [were also observed and] reported by Transport Canada."</p>
<p>With a series of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models. Later repairs, of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978, added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park. A legacy of the Audi 5000 and other reported cases of sudden unintended acceleration are intricate <a href="/wiki/Gear_stick" title="Gear stick">gear stick</a> patterns and brake <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interlock" title="Interlock">interlock</a> mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse. It is unclear how the defects in the idle-stabilization system were addressed.</p>
<p>Audi's U.S. sales, which had reached 74,061 in 1985, dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for three years. – with resale values falling dramatically. Audi subsequently offered increased warranty protection and renamed the affected models – with the <i>5000</i> becoming the <i>100</i> and <i>200</i> in 1989 – and only reached the same sales levels again by model year 2000.</p>
<p>A 2010 <i>BusinessWeek</i> article – outlining possible parallels between Audi's experience and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2009%E2%80%932010_Toyota_vehicle_recalls" title="2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls">2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls</a> – noted a class-action lawsuit filed in 1987 by about 7,500 Audi 5000-model owners remains unsettled and is currently being contested in county court in Chicago after appeals at the Illinois state and U.S. federal levels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Model_introductions">Model introductions</span></h3>
<p>In the mid-to-late 1990s, Audi introduced new technologies including the use of aluminum construction. Produced from 1999 to 2005, the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A2" title="Audi A2">Audi A2</a> was a futuristic super mini, born from the Al2 concept, with many features that helped regain consumer confidence, like the aluminium <a href="/wiki/Space_frame" title="Space frame">space frame</a>, which was a first in production car design. In the A2 Audi further expanded their TDI technology through the use of frugal three-cylinder engines. The A2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a <a href="/wiki/Wind_tunnel" title="Wind tunnel">wind tunnel</a>. The Audi A2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted Audi as a cutting-edge manufacturer. The model, a <a href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_A-Class" title="Mercedes-Benz A-Class">Mercedes-Benz A-Class</a> competitor, sold relatively well in Europe. However, the A2 was discontinued in 2005 and Audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement.</p>
<p>The next major model change came in 1995 when the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A4" title="Audi A4">Audi A4</a> replaced the <a href="/wiki/Audi_80" title="Audi 80">Audi 80</a>. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A6" title="Audi A6">Audi A6</a> (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the <a href="/wiki/Audi_S6" title="Audi S6">S6</a> and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_Cabriolet" title="Audi Cabriolet">Audi Cabriolet</a> continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new <a href="/wiki/Audi_A3" title="Audi A3">A3</a> <a href="/wiki/Hatchback" title="Hatchback">hatchback</a> model (sharing the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf_Mk4" title="Volkswagen Golf Mk4">Volkswagen Golf Mk4</a>'s platform) was introduced to the range in 1996, and the radical <a href="/wiki/Audi_TT" title="Audi TT">Audi TT</a> <a href="/wiki/Coup%C3%A9" title="Coupé">coupé</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)" title="Roadster (automobile)">roadster</a> were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings.</p>
<p>The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L four-cylinder, 1.8 L four-cylinder turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L <a href="/wiki/V6_engine" title="V6 engine">V6</a>, 2.2 L turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2 L <a href="/wiki/V8_engine" title="V8 engine">V8 engine</a>. The V6s were replaced by new 2.4 L and 2.8 L 30V V6s in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L <a href="/wiki/W12_engine" title="W12 engine">W12 engine</a> for the A8.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Audi_AG_today">Audi AG today</span></h3>
<p>Audi's sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009. One factor for its popularity in China is that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China. As of late 2009, Audi's operating profit of €1.17-billion ($1.85-billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen Group's nine-month operating profit of €1.5-billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley and SEAT had suffered considerable losses. May 2011 saw record sales for Audi of America with the new <a href="/wiki/Audi_A7" title="Audi A7">Audi A7</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audi_A3" title="Audi A3">Audi A3</a> TDI Clean Diesel. In May 2012, Audi reported a 10% increase in its sales—from 408 units to 480 in the last year alone.</p>
<p>Audi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world, some of which are shared with other VW Group marques although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within other Volkswagen Group plants.</p>
<p>Audi's two principal assembly plants are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Ingolstadt" title="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, Opened by Auto Union in 1964, (A3, A4, A5, Q5)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Neckarsulm" title="Neckarsulm">Neckarsulm</a>, Acquired from NSU in 1969 (A4, A6, A7, A8, R8 &amp; all RS variants)</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of Germany, Audi produces vehicles at:</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Aurangabad,_Maharashtra" title="Aurangabad, Maharashtra">Aurangabad</a>, India since 2006</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Bratislava" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, Slovakia, shared with Volkswagen, SEAT, Škoda and Porsche (Q7)</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Chiapa" title="San José Chiapa">San José Chiapa</a>, Mexico (Q5)</li>
</ul>
<p>In September 2012, Audi announced the construction of its first North American manufacturing plant in <a href="/wiki/Puebla" title="Puebla">Puebla</a>, Mexico. This plant is expected to be operative in 2016 and produce the second generation Q5.</p>
<p>From 2002 up to 2003, Audi headed the Audi Brand Group, a subdivision of the Volkswagen Group's Automotive Division consisting of Audi, Lamborghini and SEAT, that was focused on sporty values, with the marques' product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the Audi brand.</p>
<p>In 2014, most of the Audi dealers in UK falsely claimed that the Audi A7, A8, and R8 were Euro NCAP safety tested, all achieving five out of five stars. In fact none were tested.</p>
<p>In 2015, Audi admitted that at least 2.1 million Audi cars had been involved in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_testing_scandal" title="Volkswagen emissions testing scandal">Volkswagen emissions testing scandal</a> in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels. The A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models were implicated in the scandal. Audi promised to quickly find a technical solution and upgrade the cars so they can function within emissions regulations. Ulrich Hackenberg, the head of research and development at Audi, was suspended in relation to the scandal. Despite widespread media coverage about the scandal through the month of September, Audi reported that U.S. sales for the month had increased by 16.2%.</p>
<p>In November 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implicated the 3-liter diesel engine versions of the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L and the Q5 as further models that had emissions regulation defeat-device software installed. Thus, these models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine times the legal limit when the car detected that it was not hooked up to emissions testing equipment.</p>

<p>Audi produces 100% <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galvanisation" title="Galvanisation">galvanised</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobiles" title="Automobiles">cars</a> to prevent <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a>, and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so, following introduction of the process by <a href="/wiki/Porsche" title="Porsche">Porsche</a>, c. 1975. Along with other precautionary measures, the full-body <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a> coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year <a href="/wiki/Warranty" title="Warranty">warranty</a> against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years (except for aluminium bodies which do not rust).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Space_frame">Space frame</span></h3>

<p>Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-1990s and continues to pursue new technology and high performance. An all-aluminium car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">Audi A8</a> was launched, which introduced aluminium <a href="/wiki/Space_frame" title="Space frame">space frame</a> technology (called <i>Audi Space Frame</i> or ASF) which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame. Prior to that effort, Audi used examples of the Type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique. The disadvantage of the aluminium frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminium bodyshop. The weight reduction is somewhat offset by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel_drive_system)" title="Quattro (four-wheel drive system)">quattro</a> <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">four-wheel drive</a> system which is standard in most markets. Nonetheless, the A8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment, also having best-in-class fuel economy. The <a href="/wiki/Audi_A2" title="Audi A2">Audi A2</a>, <a href="/wiki/Audi_TT" title="Audi TT">Audi TT</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_R8_(road_car)" title="Audi R8 (road car)">Audi R8</a> also use Audi Space Frame designs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Drivetrains">Drivetrains</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Layout">Layout</span></h4>
<p>For most of its lineup (excluding the A3, A1, and TT models), Audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is typically found in economy cars (such as Peugeot and Citroën), since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed. To be able to mount powerful engines (such as a V8 engine in the <a href="/wiki/Audi_S4" title="Audi S4">Audi S4</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_RS4" title="Audi RS4">Audi RS4</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/W12_engine" title="W12 engine">W12 engine</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">Audi A8L W12</a>), Audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a <a href="/wiki/Longitudinal_engine" title="Longitudinal engine">longitudinally</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Front-engine_design" title="Front-engine design">front-mounted engine</a>, in an "overhung" position, over the front wheels in front of the axle line - this layout dates back to the DKW and Auto Union saloons from the 1950s. But while this allows for the easy adoption of all-wheel drive, it goes against the ideal 50:50 weight distribution.</p>
<p>In all its post <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>-era models, Audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive" title="Rear-wheel drive">rear-wheel drive</a> layout favored by its two archrivals <a href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz" title="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a href="/wiki/BMW" title="BMW">BMW</a>, favoring either <a href="/wiki/Front-wheel_drive" title="Front-wheel drive">front-wheel drive</a> or <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">all-wheel drive</a>. The majority of Audi's lineup in the United States features all-wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles (only the entry-level trims of the A4 and A6 are available with front-wheel drive), in contrast to <a href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz" title="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a href="/wiki/BMW" title="BMW">BMW</a> whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option. BMW did not offer all-wheel drive on its V8-powered cars (as opposed to crossover SUVs) until the 2010 BMW 7 Series and 2011 BMW 5 Series, while the Audi A8 has had all-wheel drive available/standard since the 1990s. Regarding high-performance variants, <a href="/wiki/Audi_S_and_RS_models" title="Audi S and RS models">Audi S and RS models</a> have always had all-wheel drive, unlike their direct rivals from <a href="/wiki/BMW_M" title="BMW M">BMW M</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mercedes-AMG" title="Mercedes-AMG">Mercedes-AMG</a> whose cars are rear-wheel drive only (although their performance crossover SUVs are all-wheel drive).</p>
<p>Audi has recently applied the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel_drive_system)" title="Quattro (four-wheel drive system)">quattro</a></i> badge to models such as the A3 and TT which do not use the <a href="/wiki/Torsen" title="Torsen">Torsen</a>-based system as in prior years with a mechanical center differential, but with the <a href="/wiki/Haldex_Traction" title="Haldex Traction">Haldex Traction</a> electro-mechanical clutch AWD system.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/List_of_Audi_vehicles#Production_model_engines" title="List of Audi vehicles">Audi production engines</a></div>
<p>Prior to the introduction of the Audi 80 and Audi 50 in 1972 and 1974, respectively, Audi had led the development of the <i>EA111</i> and <i>EA827</i> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Straight-four_engine" title="Straight-four engine">inline-four</a> engine families. These new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company Volkswagen (in the Polo, Golf, Passat and Scirocco), whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of VW Group vehicles right up to the present day.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Audi, along with Volvo, was the champion of the <a href="/wiki/Straight-five_engine" title="Straight-five engine">inline-five</a> cylinder, <a href="/wiki/Engine_displacement" title="Engine displacement">2.1/2.2 L</a> engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines. This engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars. The 2.1 L inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the <a href="/wiki/Rallying" title="Rallying">rally cars</a> in the 1980s, providing well over 400 horsepower (300 kilowatts) after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power.</p>
<p>For the ultra-luxury version of its <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">Audi A8</a> fullsize luxury flagship sedan, the Audi A8L W12, Audi uses the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Group" title="Volkswagen Group">Volkswagen Group</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Volkswagen_Group_petrol_engines#W12" title="List of Volkswagen Group petrol engines">W12 engine</a> instead of the conventional <a href="/wiki/V12_engine" title="V12 engine">V12 engine</a> favored by rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The W12 engine configuration (also known as a "WR12") is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15° <a href="/wiki/VR6_engine" title="VR6 engine">VR6 engines</a> at an angle of 72°, and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two <a href="/wiki/Overhead_camshaft" title="Overhead camshaft">overhead camshafts</a> to drive each pair of banks, so just four are needed in total. The advantage of the W12 engine is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional <a href="/wiki/V12_engine" title="V12 engine">V12 engine</a> could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, the 6.0 L W12 in the Audi A8L W12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2 L V8 that powers the Audi A8 4.2 variants. The 2011 Audi A8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the W12 (WR12) engine with 500 PS (370 kW; 490 hp).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fuel_Stratified_Injection">Fuel Stratified Injection</span></h4>
<p>New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_direct_injection" title="Gasoline direct injection">Fuel Stratified Injection</a> (FSI) engines. Nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Direct-Shift_Gearbox">Direct-Shift Gearbox</span></h4>
<p>At the turn of the century, Volkswagen introduced the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct-Shift_Gearbox" title="Direct-Shift Gearbox">Direct-Shift Gearbox</a> (DSG), a type of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dual_clutch_transmission" title="Dual clutch transmission">dual clutch transmission</a>.

This is implemented in some <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf" title="Volkswagen Golf">VW Golfs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Audi_A3" title="Audi A3">Audi A3</a>, <a href="/wiki/Audi_A4" title="Audi A4">Audi A4</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audi_TT" title="Audi TT">TT</a> models where DSG is called S-tronic.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="LED_daytime_running_lights">LED daytime running lights</span></h3>
<p>Beginning in 2005, Audi has implemented white <a href="/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" title="Light-emitting diode">LED</a> technology as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Daytime_running_light" title="Daytime running light">daytime running lights</a> (DRL) in their products. The distinctive shape of the DRLs has become a trademark of sorts. LEDs were first introduced on the <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8#D3" title="Audi A8">Audi A8 W12</a>, the world's first production car to have LED DRLs, and have since spread throughout the entire model range. The LEDs are present on some Audi <a href="/wiki/Billboard" title="Billboard">billboards</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2010, Audi has also offered the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LED_headlamp" title="LED headlamp">LED technology in low- and high-beam headlights</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Multi_Media_Interface">Multi Media Interface</span></h3>

<p>Starting with the 2003 <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">Audi A8</a>, Audi has used a centralised control interface for its on-board <a href="/wiki/Infotainment" title="Infotainment">infotainment</a> systems, called <a href="/wiki/Multi_Media_Interface" title="Multi Media Interface">Multi Media Interface</a> (MMI). This came amid criticism of BMW's <a href="/wiki/IDrive" title="IDrive">iDrive</a> control. It is essentially a rotating control knob and 'segment' buttons – designed to control all in-car entertainment devices (radio, CD changer, iPod, TV tuner), satellite navigation, heating and ventilation, and other car controls with a screen. MMI was widely reported to be a considerable improvement on BMW's iDrive, although BMW has since made their iDrive more user-friendly.</p>
<p>The availability of MMI has gradually filtered down the Audi lineup, and following its introduction on the third generation A3 in 2011, MMI is now available across the entire range. It has been generally well received, as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob, along with 'main function' direct access buttons – with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions. The colour screen is mounted on the upright dashboard, and on the A4 (new), A5, A6, A8, and Q7, the controls are mounted horizontally.</p>

<p>In 1984, Audi launched the short-wheelbase <a href="/wiki/Audi_Quattro#Sport_Quattro" title="Audi Quattro">Sport Quattro</a> which dominated rally races in <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo_Rally" title="Monte Carlo Rally">Monte Carlo</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Swedish_Rally" title="Swedish Rally">Sweden</a>, with Audi taking all podium places, but succumbed to problems further into WRC contention. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1985_World_Rally_Championship_season" title="1985 World Rally Championship season">1985</a>, after another season mired in mediocre finishes, <a href="/wiki/Walter_R%C3%B6hrl" title="Walter Röhrl">Walter Röhrl</a> finished the season in his <a href="/wiki/Audi_Quattro#Sport_Quattro_S1_E2" title="Audi Quattro">Sport Quattro S1</a>, and helped place Audi second in the manufacturers' points. Audi also received rally honours in the Hong Kong to Beijing rally in that same year. <a href="/wiki/Mich%C3%A8le_Mouton" title="Michèle Mouton">Michèle Mouton</a>, the only female driver to win a round of the World Rally Championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the "S1", and raced in the <a href="/wiki/Pikes_Peak_International_Hill_Climb" title="Pikes Peak International Hill Climb">Pikes Peak International Hill Climb</a>. The 1,439-metre (4,721 ft) climb race pits a driver and car to drive to the summit of the 4,302-metre (14,114 ft) <a href="/wiki/Pikes_Peak" title="Pikes Peak">Pikes Peak</a> mountain in <a href="/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and in 1985, Michèle Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39, and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1986_World_Rally_Championship_season" title="1986 World Rally Championship season">1986</a>, Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rally_Portugal" title="Rally Portugal">Portugal</a> involving driver <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Joaquim_Santos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Joaquim Santos (page does not exist)">Joaquim Santos</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Ford_RS200" title="Ford RS200">Ford RS200</a>.

<p>In 1987, Walter Röhrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1, which he had retired from the WRC two years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi's time-tested <a href="/wiki/Straight-five_engine" title="Straight-five engine">inline-five-cylinder</a> turbocharged engine, with the final version generating 441 kW (600 PS; 591 bhp). The engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on Audi's famous four-wheel drive system. All of Audi's top drivers drove this car; Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Röhrl and Michèle Mouton. This Audi S1 started the range of Audi <a href="/wiki/Audi_S_and_RS_models#S" title="Audi S and RS models">'S' cars</a>, which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream Audi model range.</p>

<p>As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose to move first into America with the <a href="/wiki/Trans-Am_Series" title="Trans-Am Series">Trans-Am</a> in 1988.</p>
<p>In 1989, Audi moved to <a href="/wiki/International_Motor_Sports_Association" title="International Motor Sports Association">International Motor Sports Association</a> (IMSA) <a href="/wiki/IMSA_GT_Championship" title="IMSA GT Championship">GTO</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Audi_80" title="Audi 80">Audi 90</a>, however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title.</p>

<p>In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in North America, Audi returned to Europe, turning first to the <a href="/wiki/Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Meisterschaft" title="Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft">Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft</a> (DTM) series with the <a href="/wiki/Audi_V8" title="Audi V8">Audi V8</a>, and then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast-growing <a href="/wiki/Super_Touring" title="Super Touring">Super Touring</a> series, which are a series of national championships. Audi first entered in the <a href="/wiki/French_Supertouring_Championship" title="French Supertouring Championship">French Supertourisme</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italian_Superturismo_Championship" title="Italian Superturismo Championship">Italian Superturismo</a>. In the following year, Audi would switch to the German <a href="/wiki/Super_Tourenwagen_Cup" title="Super Tourenwagen Cup">Super Tourenwagen Cup</a> (known as STW), and then to <a href="/wiki/British_Touring_Car_Championship" title="British Touring Car Championship">British Touring Car Championship</a> (BTCC) the year after that.</p>

<p>By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_RS4#B5" title="Audi RS4">RS4</a> for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SPEED_World_Challenge" title="SPEED World Challenge">SCCA Speed World GT Challenge</a>, through dealer/team <a href="/wiki/Champion_Racing" title="Champion Racing">Champion Racing</a> competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Audi_RS6#C5" title="Audi RS6">RS6</a>. Once again, the quattro four-wheel drive was superior, and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title, but a newcomer, Cadillac with the new Omega Chassis CTS-V, gave them a run for their money. After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car's performance. Namely, added ballast weights, and Champion Audi deciding to go with different tyres, and reducing the boost pressure of the turbocharger.</p>
<p>In 2004, after years of competing with the <a href="/wiki/Audi_TT" title="Audi TT">TT-R</a> in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team Abt Racing/<a href="/wiki/Christian_Abt" title="Christian Abt">Christian Abt</a> taking the 2002 title with <a href="/wiki/Laurent_A%C3%AFello" title="Laurent Aïello">Laurent Aïello</a>, Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported <a href="/wiki/Joest_Racing" title="Joest Racing">Joest Racing</a> <a href="/wiki/Audi_A4#Audi_Sport_A4_DTM" title="Audi A4">A4 DTM</a> cars.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/List_of_Audi_vehicles#Le_Mans_prototypes" title="List of Audi vehicles">List of Audi vehicles (Le Mans prototypes)</a></div>

<p>Audi began racing prototype sportscars in 1999, debuting at the Le Mans 24 hour. Two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season - the <a href="/wiki/Audi_R8R" title="Audi R8R">Audi R8R</a> (open-cockpit 'roadster' prototype) and the <a href="/wiki/Audi_R8C" title="Audi R8C">Audi R8C</a> (closed-cockpit 'coupé' GT-prototype). The R8R scored a credible podium on its racing debut at Le Mans and was the concept which Audi continued to develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes.</p>
<p>However, most of the competitors (such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and Nissan) retired at the end of 1999. The factory-supported <a href="/wiki/Joest_Racing" title="Joest Racing">Joest Racing</a> team won at Le Mans three times in a row with the Audi R8 (2000–2002), as well as winning every race in the <a href="/wiki/American_Le_Mans_Series" title="American Le Mans Series">American Le Mans Series</a> in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as <a href="/wiki/Champion_Racing" title="Champion Racing">Champion Racing</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, two <a href="/wiki/Bentley_Speed_8" title="Bentley Speed 8">Bentley Speed 8s</a>, with engines designed by Audi, and driven by Joest drivers <i>loaned</i> to the fellow <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Group" title="Volkswagen Group">Volkswagen Group</a> company, competed in the GTP class, and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall, and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner's podium at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/2005_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="2005 24 Hours of Le Mans">2005 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, Champion Racing entered two R8s, along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team <a href="/wiki/Oreca" title="Oreca">Oreca</a>. The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a narrower air inlet restrictor, reducing power, and an additional 50 kg (110 lb) of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis. On average, the R8s were about 2–3 seconds off pace compared to the <a href="/wiki/Pescarolo_Sport" title="Pescarolo Sport">Pescarolo</a>–<a href="/wiki/Judd_(engine)" title="Judd (engine)">Judd</a>. But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third, while the Oreca team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GTs in 1967. This also ends the long era of the R8; however, its replacement for 2006, called the <a href="/wiki/Audi_R10_TDI" title="Audi R10 TDI">Audi R10 TDI</a>, was unveiled on 13 December 2005.</p>
<p>The R10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turbocharged_Direct_Injection" title="Turbocharged Direct Injection">TDI</a> employed many new and innovative features, the most notable being the <a href="/wiki/Twin-turbo" title="Twin-turbo">twin-turbocharged</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct_fuel_injection" title="Direct fuel injection">direct injection</a> <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a>.

Audi has been on the forefront of sports car racing, claiming a historic win in the first diesel sports car at 12 Hours of Sebring (the car was developed with a Diesel engine due to ACO regulations that favor diesel engines). As well as winning the <a href="/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="24 Hours of Le Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> in 2006 making history, the R10 TDI has also shown its capabilities by beating the <a href="/wiki/Peugeot_908_HDi_FAP" title="Peugeot 908 HDi FAP">Peugeot 908 HDi FAP</a> in <a href="/wiki/2007_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="2007 24 Hours of Le Mans">2007</a>, and beating Peugeot again in <a href="/wiki/2008_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="2008 24 Hours of Le Mans">2008</a>, (however Peugeot won the 24h in 2009) and, in a podium clean-sweep by proving its reliability throughout the race (compared to all four 908 entries retired before the end of the race) while breaking a new distance record (set way back by the <a href="/wiki/Porsche_917" title="Porsche 917">Porsche 917</a>K of <a href="/wiki/Martini_Racing" title="Martini Racing">Martini Racing</a> in <a href="/wiki/1971_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="1971 24 Hours of Le Mans">1971</a>), in <a href="/wiki/2010_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans" title="2010 24 Hours of Le Mans">2010</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Audi_R15_TDI" title="Audi R15 TDI">R15 TDI Plus</a>.</p>

This was a successful operation with the team winning on its debut in the series at the 2000 12 Hours of Sebring.

<p>The Audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marque" title="Marque">marques</a> of Auto Union. The Audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer. The design is popularly believed to have been the idea of <a href="/wiki/Klaus_von_Oertzen" title="Klaus von Oertzen">Klaus von Oertzen</a>, the director of sales at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wanderer_(car)" title="Wanderer (car)">Wanderer</a> - when <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> was chosen as the host city for the <a href="/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics" title="1936 Summer Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a> and that a form of the Olympic logo symbolized the newly established Auto Union's desire to succeed.

<p>The original "Audi" script, with the distinctive slanted tails on the "A" and "d" was created for the historic Audi company in 1920 by the famous graphic designer <a href="/wiki/Lucian_Bernhard" title="Lucian Bernhard">Lucian Bernhard</a>, and was resurrected when Volkswagen revived the brand in 1965. Following the demise of NSU in 1977, less prominence was given to the four rings, in preference to the "Audi" script encased within a black (later red) ellipse, and was commonly displayed next to the Volkswagen roundel when the two brands shared a dealer network under the <b>V.A.G</b> banner. The ellipse (known as the Audi Oval) was phased out after 1994, when Audi formed its own independent dealer network, and prominence was given back to the four rings - at the same time Audi Sans (a derivative of <a href="/wiki/Univers" title="Univers">Univers</a>) was adopted as the font for all marketing materials, corporate communications and was also used in the vehicles themselves.</p>
<p>As part of Audi's centennial celebration in 2009, the company updated the logo, changing the <a href="/wiki/Font" title="Font">font</a> to left-aligned Audi Type, and altering the shading for the overlapping rings. The revised logo was designed by Rayan Abdullah.</p>
<p>Audi developed a Corporate Sound concept, with Audi Sound Studio designed for producing the Corporate Sound. The Corporate Sound project began with sound agency Klangerfinder GmbH &amp; Co KG and s12 GmbH. Audio samples were created in Klangerfinder's sound studio in Stuttgart, becoming part of Audi Sound Studio collection. Other Audi Sound Studio components include The Brand Music Pool, The Brand Voice. Audi also developed Sound Branding Toolkit including certain instruments, sound themes, rhythm and car sounds which all are supposed to reflect the AUDI sound character.</p>
<p>Audi started using a beating heart sound trademark beginning in 1996. An updated heartbeat sound logo, developed by agencies KLANGERFINDER GmbH &amp; Co KG of Stuttgart and S12 GmbH of Munich, was first used in 2010 in an <a href="/wiki/Audi_A8" title="Audi A8">Audi A8</a> commercial with the slogan "The Art of Progress."</p>

The German-language tagline is used in many European countries, including the United Kingdom, and in other markets, such as Latin America, Oceania and parts of Asia including Japan. A few years ago, the North American tagline was <i>"Innovation through technology"</i>, but in Canada the German tagline <i>Vorsprung durch Technik</i> was used in advertising. Since 2007, Audi has used the slogan "Truth in Engineering" in the U.S. However, since the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_violations" title="Volkswagen emissions violations">Audi emissions testing scandal</a> came to light in September 2015, this slogan was lambasted for being discordant with reality. In fact, just hours after disgraced Volkswagen CEO <a href="/wiki/Martin_Winterkorn" title="Martin Winterkorn">Martin Winterkorn</a> admitted to cheating on emissions data, an advertisement during the 2015 Primetime Emmy Awards promoted Audi's latest advances in low emissions technology with Kermit the Frog stating, "It's not that easy being green."</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Audi_TDI">Audi TDI</span></h3>
<p>As part of Audi's attempt to promote its Diesel technology in 2009, the company began Audi Mileage Marathon. The driving tour featured a fleet of 23 Audi TDI vehicles from 4 models (<a href="/wiki/Audi_Q7" title="Audi Q7">Audi Q7</a> 3.0 TDI, <a href="/wiki/Audi_Q5" title="Audi Q5">Audi Q5</a> 3.0 TDI, <a href="/wiki/Audi_A4" title="Audi A4">Audi A4</a> 3.0 TDI, <a href="/wiki/Audi_A3" title="Audi A3">Audi A3</a> Sportback 2.0 TDI with S tronic transmission) travelling across the American continent from New York to Los Angeles, passing major cities like Chicago, Dallas and Las Vegas during the 13 daily stages, as well as natural wonders including the Rocky Mountains, Death Valley and the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>As part of 2014 model year Audi TDI vehicles launch in the US, 3 television commercials ("The Station", "Future", "Range") were produced. In the 60-second 'The Station' ad, a woman at a fueling station reaches for the diesel pump to fill up her Audi A6. In a dramatic fashion, unsuspecting onlookers race towards her and they can't imagine the luxury vehicle is in fact a diesel. The spot ends with the tagline "It's time to rethink diesel – join the club." "The Station" appeared on primetime network and cable 2013 fall programming including Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Hostages, Sons of Anarchy and NBC NFL Sunday Night Football. The 15-second "Range" ad demonstrates the potential to drive from New York to Chicago on a single tank of gas, covering a range of approximately 790 miles. In the 15-second "Future" ad, viewers see the potential for clean diesel as today's leading alternative fuel solution and an intelligent choice for those on the leading-edge. Audi TDI provides drivers with 30% better fuel economy and range without compromises on performance and design. In addition to the three new television spots, Audi also tried to dispel the most common myths of diesel – gas station availability, the smell and perception associated with an older generation of diesel vehicles, weak performance – in a series of four online video shorts that would roll out over the next two months on the Audi YouTube channel (<a class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiusa" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/audiusa</a>). The spots also will appear on The Washington Post and Slate.com in a custom user-generated content hub through 2013-10-31. In addition to standard and high-impact ads, the content hub features custom videos, articles and infographics, along with relevant social conversations. The Audi TDI clean diesel campaign also features print ads that reinforce the message "the future of fuel is here now." Print ads would roll out in select automotive buff books in fall 2013. 'The Station' ad was premiered in Canada in September 2013. 'The Station' (also called 'The Moment of Truth') ad was produced by Venables Bell &amp; Partners, Biscuit Filmworks, Final Cut.</p>
<p>As part of 2014 model year Audi TDI vehicles launch in the US, the 'Truth in 48' driving challenge took place from Audi Pacific dealership at Los Angeles to New York in 48 hours or less, began at 9 a.m. PDT on 2013-09-07. The Coast-to-coast attempt used 2014 Audi A6 TDI and Audi A7 TDI and a 2014 Audi Q5 TDI crossover as the support vehicle, with teams of eight noted hypermilers and four journalists.</p>
