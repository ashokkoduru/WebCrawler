<p><b>Pesticides</b> are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pest_(animal)" title="Pest (animal)">pest</a>. They are a class of <a href="/wiki/Biocide" title="Biocide">biocide</a>. The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as <a href="/wiki/Weed" title="Weed">weeds</a>, fungi, or <a href="/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. This use of pesticides is so common that the term <i>pesticide</i> is often treated as synonymous with <i>plant protection product</i>, although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes. The term pesticide includes all of the following: <a href="/wiki/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" title="Insecticide">insecticide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insect_growth_regulator" title="Insect growth regulator">insect growth regulator</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nematicide" title="Nematicide">nematicide</a>, termiticide, <a href="/wiki/Molluscicide" title="Molluscicide">molluscicide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Piscicide" title="Piscicide">piscicide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Avicide" title="Avicide">avicide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rodenticide" title="Rodenticide">rodenticide</a>, predacide, <a href="/wiki/Bactericide" title="Bactericide">bactericide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insect_repellent" title="Insect repellent">insect repellent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Animal_repellent" title="Animal repellent">animal repellent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antimicrobial" title="Antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fungicide" title="Fungicide">fungicide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Disinfectant" title="Disinfectant">disinfectant</a> (<a href="/wiki/Antimicrobial" title="Antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a>), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sanitizer" title="Sanitizer">sanitizer</a>.</p>
<p>In general, a pesticide is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> or biological agent (such as a <a href="/wiki/Virus" title="Virus">virus</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bacterium" title="Bacterium">bacterium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antimicrobial" title="Antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Disinfectant" title="Disinfectant">disinfectant</a>) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogens</a>, weeds, <a href="/wiki/Mollusca" title="Mollusca">mollusks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nematode" title="Nematode">nematodes</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roundworm" title="Roundworm">roundworms</a>), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbe" title="Microbe">microbes</a> that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease <a href="/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)" title="Vector (epidemiology)">vectors</a>. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species. According to the <a href="/wiki/Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants" title="Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants">Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants</a>, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_chemicals" title="Organic chemicals">organic chemicals</a> are organochlorine pesticides.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO) has defined <i>pesticide</i> as:</p>

<p>Pesticides can be classified by target <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a> (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" title="Insecticide">insecticides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fungicide" title="Fungicide">fungicides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rodenticide" title="Rodenticide">rodenticides</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pediculicide" title="Pediculicide">pediculicides</a> - see table), chemical structure (e.g., organic, inorganic, synthetic, or <a href="/wiki/Biopesticide" title="Biopesticide">biological (biopesticide)</a>, although the distinction can sometimes blur), and physical state (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Fumigation" title="Fumigation">gaseous (fumigant)</a>). <a href="/wiki/Biopesticide" title="Biopesticide">Biopesticides</a> include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides. Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly. These include the <a href="/wiki/Pyrethrum" title="Pyrethrum">pyrethroids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rotenone" title="Rotenone">rotenoids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicotine" title="Nicotine">nicotinoids</a>, and a fourth group that includes <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scilliroside" title="Scilliroside">scilliroside</a>.</p>
<p>Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organochlorine" title="Organochlorine">organochlorines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Organophosphate" title="Organophosphate">organophosphates</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Carbamate" title="Carbamate">carbamates</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organochlorine" title="Organochlorine">Organochlorine</a> hydrocarbons (e.g., <a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to <a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a>. <a href="/wiki/Organophosphate" title="Organophosphate">Organophosphate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbamate" title="Carbamate">carbamates</a> largely replaced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organochlorine" title="Organochlorine">organochlorines</a>. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase" title="Acetylcholinesterase">acetylcholinesterase</a>, allowing <a href="/wiki/Acetylcholine" title="Acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a> to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2,4-D" title="2,4-D">2,4-D</a>), triazines (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Atrazine" title="Atrazine">atrazine</a>), ureas (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diuron" title="Diuron">diuron</a>), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Alachlor" title="Alachlor">alachlor</a>). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including <a href="/wiki/Glyphosate" title="Glyphosate">glyphosate</a>.</p>
<p>Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method. Most pesticides work by <a href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">poisoning</a> pests. A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant. With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the <a href="/wiki/Xylem" title="Xylem">xylem</a>) and outward. Increased efficiency may be a result. Systemic insecticides, which poison <a href="/wiki/Pollen" title="Pollen">pollen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nectar" title="Nectar">nectar</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Flower" title="Flower">flowers</a>, may kill <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bees" title="Bees">bees</a> and other needed <a href="/wiki/Pollinator" title="Pollinator">pollinators</a>.</p>
<p>In 2009, the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced. These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins, which fungi then detoxify using enzymes. The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes. They are believed to be safer and greener.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>
<p>Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful. For example, they are used to kill <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mosquitoes" title="Mosquitoes">mosquitoes</a> that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Nile_virus" title="West Nile virus">West Nile virus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. They can also kill <a href="/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wasp" title="Wasp">wasps</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a> that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by <a href="/wiki/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">parasites</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Flea" title="Flea">fleas</a>. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by <a href="/wiki/Mold" title="Mold">moldy</a> food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush. They can also kill invasive <a href="/wiki/Weed" title="Weed">weeds</a> that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a> and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rodents" title="Rodents">rodents</a> and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochlorine that has been used to fight <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a> since the 1950s. Recent policy statements by the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> have given stronger support to this approach. However, DDT and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity. DDT use is not always effective, as <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_resistance" title="Pesticide resistance">resistance to DDT</a> was identified in Africa as early as 1955, and by 1972 nineteen species of mosquito worldwide were resistant to DDT.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Amount_used">Amount used</span></h2>
<p>In 2006 and 2007, the world used approximately <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)#106_to_1011_kg" title="Orders of magnitude (mass)">2.4 megatonnes (5.3<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 lb)</a> of pesticides, with herbicides constituting the biggest part of the world pesticide use at 40%, followed by insecticides (17%) and fungicides (10%). In 2006 and 2007 the U.S. used approximately 0.5 megatonnes (1.1<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 lb) of pesticides, accounting for 22% of the world total, including 857 million pounds (389 kt) of conventional pesticides, which are used in the agricultural sector (80% of conventional pesticide use) as well as the industrial, commercial, governmental and home &amp; garden sectors.Pesticides are also found in majority of U.S. households with 78 million out of the 105.5 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide. As of 2007, there were more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides, which yield over 20,000 pesticide products that are marketed in the United States.</p>
<p>The US used some 1 kg (2.2 pounds) per <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectare</a> of <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">arable land</a> compared with: 4.7 kg in China, 1.3 kg in the UK, 0.1 kg in <a href="/wiki/Cameroon" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, 5.9 kg in Japan and 2.5 kg in Italy. Insecticide use in the US has declined by more than half since 1980, (.6%/yr) mostly due to the near phase-out of <a href="/wiki/Organophosphate" title="Organophosphate">organophosphates</a>. In corn fields, the decline was even steeper, due to the switchover to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transgenic" title="Transgenic">transgenic</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bt_corn" title="Bt corn">Bt corn</a>.</p>
<p>For the global market of <a href="/wiki/Crop_protection" title="Crop protection">crop protection</a> products, market analysts forecast revenues of over 52 billion US$ in 2019.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefits">Benefits</span></h2>
<p>Pesticides can save farmers' money by preventing crop losses to insects and other pests; in the U.S., farmers get an estimated fourfold return on money they spend on pesticides. One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%. Another study, conducted in 1999, found that a ban on pesticides in the United States may result in a rise of food prices, loss of jobs, and an increase in world hunger.</p>
<p>There are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary. Primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Monetary">Monetary</span></h3>
<p>Every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved. This means based that, on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds. In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round. The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria. The use of pesticides creates a large job market within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agrichemical" title="Agrichemical">agrichemical</a> sector.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Costs">Costs</span></h2>
<p>On the cost side of pesticide use there can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_damage" title="Environmental damage">costs to the environment</a>, costs to human health, as well as costs of the development and research of new pesticides.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h3>

<p>Pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in people who are exposed. Pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects, ranging from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer. A 2007 <a href="/wiki/Systematic_review" title="Systematic review">systematic review</a> found that "most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure" and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased. There is substantial evidence of associations between organophosphate insecticide exposures and neurobehavioral alterations. Limited evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Birth_defects" title="Birth defects">birth defects</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fetal_death" title="Fetal death">fetal death</a>.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting exposure of children to pesticides and using safer alternatives:</p>
<p>The World Health Organization and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Environment_Programme" title="UN Environment Programme">UN Environment Programme</a> estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_poisoning" title="Pesticide poisoning">poisoning from pesticides</a>, about 18,000 of whom die. Owing to inadequate regulation and safety precautions, 99% of pesticide related deaths occur in developing countries that account for only 25% of pesticide usage. According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly. There are several careers aside from agriculture that may also put individuals at risk of health effects from pesticide exposure including pet groomers, <a href="/wiki/Groundskeeping" title="Groundskeeping">groundskeepers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fumigation" title="Fumigation">fumigators</a>.</p>
<p>One study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide, and recommended, among other things, more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans.</p>
<p>A 2014 epidemiological review found associations between autism and exposure to certain pesticides, but noted that the available evidence was insufficient to conclude that the relationship was causal.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_effect">Environmental effect</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_pesticides" title="Environmental effects of pesticides">Environmental effects of pesticides</a></div>
<p>Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil. <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_drift" title="Pesticide drift">Pesticide drift</a> occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of <a href="/wiki/Water_pollution" title="Water pollution">water pollution</a>, and some pesticides are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutants" title="Persistent organic pollutants">persistent organic pollutants</a> and contribute to <a href="/wiki/Soil_contamination" title="Soil contamination">soil contamination</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, pesticide use reduces <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, contributes to <a href="/wiki/Pollinator_decline" title="Pollinator decline">pollinator decline</a>, destroys habitat (especially for birds), and threatens <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered species</a>.<br/>
Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide (<a href="/wiki/Pesticide_resistance" title="Pesticide resistance">pesticide resistance</a>), necessitating a new pesticide. Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.</p>
<p>Since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fat-soluble" title="Fat-soluble">dissolve in fats</a> and are not excreted, organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely. <a href="/wiki/Biomagnification" title="Biomagnification">Biological magnification</a> is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons (pesticides) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain. Among marine animals, pesticide concentrations are higher in carnivorous fishes, and even more so in the fish-eating birds and mammals at the top of the <a href="/wiki/Ecological_pyramid" title="Ecological pyramid">ecological pyramid</a>. <a href="/wiki/Global_distillation" title="Global distillation">Global distillation</a> is the process whereby pesticides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the Earth, in particular the Poles and mountain tops. Pesticides that evaporate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances (thousands of kilometers) by the wind to an area of lower temperature, where they condense and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow.</p>
<p>In order to reduce negative impacts, it is desirable that pesticides be degradable or at least quickly deactivated in the environment. Such loss of activity or toxicity of pesticides is due to both innate chemical properties of the compounds and environmental processes or conditions. For example, the presence of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Halogens" title="Halogens">halogens</a> within a chemical structure often slows down degradation in an aerobic environment. <a href="/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">Adsorption</a> to soil may retard pesticide movement, but also may reduce <a href="/wiki/Bioavailability" title="Bioavailability">bioavailability</a> to microbial degraders.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h3>

<p>Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is estimated at <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(currency)" title="Orders of magnitude (currency)">$9.6 billion</a> offset by about $40 billion in increased agricultural production:</p>
<p>Additional costs include the registration process and the cost of purchasing pesticides. The registration process can take several years to complete (there are 70 different types of field test) and can cost $50–70 million for a single pesticide. Annually the United States spends $10 billion on pesticides.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternatives">Alternatives</span></h2>
<p>Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of <a href="/wiki/Biological_pest_control" title="Biological pest control">biological pest controls</a> (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>, and methods of interfering with insect breeding. Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests. These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.</p>
<p>Cultivation practices include <a href="/wiki/Polyculture" title="Polyculture">polyculture</a> (growing multiple types of plants), <a href="/wiki/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">crop rotation</a>, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of <a href="/wiki/Trap_crop" title="Trap crop">trap crops</a> that attract pests away from the real crop. In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.</p>
<p>Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use. These organisms can include natural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Predator" title="Predator">predators</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parasite" title="Parasite">parasites</a> of the pests. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_pesticides" title="Biological pesticides">Biological pesticides</a> based on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Entomopathogenic_fungi" title="Entomopathogenic fungi">entomopathogenic fungi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virus" title="Virus">viruses</a> cause disease in the pest species can also be used.</p>
<p>Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by <a href="/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique" title="Sterile insect technique">sterilizing males</a> of the target species and releasing them, so that they <a href="/wiki/Mating" title="Mating">mate</a> with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the <a href="/wiki/Cochliomyia_hominivorax" title="Cochliomyia hominivorax">screwworm fly</a> in 1958 and has since been used with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medfly" title="Medfly">medfly</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Tsetse_fly" title="Tsetse fly">tsetse fly</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gypsy_moth" title="Gypsy moth">gypsy moth</a>. However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Agroecology" title="Agroecology">Agroecology</a> emphasize nutrient recycling, use of locally available and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_resources" title="Renewable resources">renewable resources</a>, adaptation to local conditions, utilization of microenvironments, reliance on indigenous knowledge and yield maximization while maintaining soil productivity. Agroecology also emphasizes empowering people and local communities to contribute to development, and encouraging “multi-directional” communications rather than the conventional “top-down” method.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Push_pull_strategy">Push pull strategy</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_technology" title="Push–pull technology">Push–pull technology</a></div>
<p>The term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for <a href="/wiki/Integrated_pest_management" title="Integrated pest management">integrated pest management</a> (IPM). This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects. "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected. "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed. There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.</p>
<p>Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world. The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming. Another successful case study was performed on the control of <i>Helicoverpa</i> in cotton crops in Australia. In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of <i>Sitona lineatus</i> in bean fields.</p>
<p>Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method. Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable. Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Effectiveness">Effectiveness</span></h3>
<p>Some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals. For example, <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops. In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase. A study of <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">Maize</a> fields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_to_nitrogen_ratio" title="Carbon to nitrogen ratio">carbon to nitrogen ratio</a> to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic <a href="/wiki/Nematode" title="Nematode">nematodes</a> and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.</p>
<p>However, pesticide resistance is increasing. In the 1940s, U.S. farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests. Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used. Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h2>
<p>Pesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control. Pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides, which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds, or persistent pesticides, which may take months or years before they are broken down: it was the persistence of DDT, for example, which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain. Another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides or are derived from a common source or production method.</p>
<p>Some examples of chemically-related pesticides are:</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Organophosphate_pesticides">Organophosphate pesticides</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organophosphates" title="Organophosphates">Organophosphates</a> affect the nervous system by disrupting, acetylcholinesterase activity, the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Most organophosphates are insecticides. They were developed during the early 19th century, but their effects on insects, which are similar to their effects on humans, were discovered in 1932. Some are very poisonous. However, they usually are not persistent in the environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carbamate_pesticides">Carbamate pesticides</span></h3>
<p>Carbamate pesticides affect the nervous system by disrupting an enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. The enzyme effects are usually reversible. There are several subgroups within the carbamates.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Organochlorine_insecticides">Organochlorine insecticides</span></h3>
<p>They were commonly used in the past, but many have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g., DDT, chlordane, and <a href="/wiki/Toxaphene" title="Toxaphene">toxaphene</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyrethroid_pesticides">Pyrethroid pesticides</span></h3>
<p>They were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin, which is found in chrysanthemums. They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment. Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sulfonylurea_herbicides">Sulfonylurea herbicides</span></h3>
<p>The following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control: amidosulfuron, azimsulfuron, bensulfuron-methyl, chlorimuron-ethyl, ethoxysulfuron, flazasulfuron, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium, halosulfuron-methyl, imazosulfuron, nicosulfuron, oxasulfuron, primisulfuron-methyl, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, rimsulfuron, sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron, terbacil, bispyribac-sodium, cyclosulfamuron, and pyrithiobac-sodium. Nicosulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Acetolactate_synthase" title="Acetolactate synthase">acetolactate synthase</a>. In the 1960s, more than 1 kg/ha (0.89 lb/acre) crop protection chemical was typically applied, while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1% as much material to achieve the same effect.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biopesticides">Biopesticides</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biopesticide" title="Biopesticide">Biopesticide</a></div>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biopesticides" title="Biopesticides">Biopesticides</a> are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides. Biopesticides fall into three major classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbial" title="Microbial">Microbial</a> pesticides which consist of bacteria, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Entomopathogenic_fungi" title="Entomopathogenic fungi">entomopathogenic fungi</a> or viruses (and sometimes includes the metabolites that bacteria or fungi produce). Entomopathogenic <a href="/wiki/Nematode" title="Nematode">nematodes</a> are also often classed as microbial pesticides, even though they are multi-cellular.</li>
<li>Biochemical pesticides or herbal pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control (or monitor in the case of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pheromones" title="Pheromones">pheromones</a>) pests and microbial diseases.</li>
<li>Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) have genetic material from other species incorporated into their genetic material (<i>i.e.</i> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GM_crop" title="GM crop">GM crops</a>). Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Classified_by_type_of_pest">Classified by type of pest</span></h3>
<p>Pesticides that are related to the type of pests are:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Further_types_of_pesticides">Further types of pesticides</span></h3>
<p>The term pesticide also include these substances:</p>
<p><b>Defoliants</b> : Cause leaves or other foliage to drop from a plant, usually to facilitate harvest.<br/>
<b>Desiccants</b> : Promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops.<br/>
<b>Insect growth regulators</b> : Disrupt the molting, maturity from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects.<br/>
<b>Plant growth regulators</b> : Substances (excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients) that alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulation">Regulation</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International">International</span></h3>
<p>In most countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.</p>
<p>In Europe, recent EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carcinogenic" title="Carcinogenic">carcinogenic</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mutagenic" title="Mutagenic">mutagenic</a> or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioaccumulative" title="Bioaccumulative">bioaccumulative</a> and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB). Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.</p>
<p>Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides, and products on which they were used are traded across international borders. To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries. The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002. The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.</p>
<p>Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=United_Nations_London_Guidelines_for_the_Exchange_of_Information_on_Chemicals_in_International_Trade&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade (page does not exist)">United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Codex_Alimentarius" title="Codex Alimentarius">United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission</a>. The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries. Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_misuse" title="Pesticide misuse">pesticide misuse</a>, but do not eliminate all misuse. Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use. <a href="/wiki/Integrated_pest_management" title="Integrated pest management">Integrated pest management</a>, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, the U.S., <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>, so that natural balances are not upset. New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks. In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's lifecycle, which can be environmentally more friendly. For example, <a href="/wiki/Potato_cyst_nematode" title="Potato cyst nematode">potato cyst nematodes</a> emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop. A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the <a href="/wiki/Nematode" title="Nematode">nematodes</a> to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_regulation_in_the_United_States" title="Pesticide regulation in the United States">Pesticide regulation in the United States</a></div>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Insecticide,_Fungicide,_and_Rodenticide_Act" title="Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act">Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act</a> (FIFRA) and the <a href="/wiki/Food_Quality_Protection_Act" title="Food Quality Protection Act">Food Quality Protection Act</a> (FQPA). Studies must be conducted to establish the conditions in which the material is safe to use and the effectiveness against the intended pest(s). The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment. Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards. All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards. During the registration process, a label is created. The label contains directions for proper use of the material in addition to safety restrictions. Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxicity_Class" title="Toxicity Class">Toxicity Class</a>.</p>
<p>Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated <a href="/wiki/Restricted_use_pesticide" title="Restricted use pesticide">restricted use pesticides</a>. Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides. Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations. These records must be made available to employees and state or territorial environmental regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>The EPA regulates pesticides under two main acts, both of which amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. In addition to the EPA, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) and the United States <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops. The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. EPA uses the National Research Council's four-step process for human health risk assessment: (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.</p>
<p>Recently Kaua'i County (Hawai'i) passed Bill No. 2491 to add an article to Chapter 22 of the county's code relating to pesticides and GMOs. The bill strengthens protections of local communities in Kaua'i where many large pesticide companies test their products.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rig_Veda" title="Rig Veda">Rig Veda</a>, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a> were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, <a href="/wiki/Nicotine" title="Nicotine">nicotine</a> <a href="/wiki/Sulfate" title="Sulfate">sulfate</a> was extracted from <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, <a href="/wiki/Pyrethrum" title="Pyrethrum">pyrethrum</a>, which is derived from <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rotenone" title="Rotenone">rotenone</a>, which is derived from the roots of tropical <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. <a href="/wiki/Paul_Hermann_M%C3%BCller" title="Paul Hermann Müller">Paul Müller</a> discovered that <a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a> was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, <a href="/wiki/Pyrethrin" title="Pyrethrin">pyrethrin</a> compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".</p>
<p>The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910; however, decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread. Some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the "pesticide era." Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972, pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes (2.5 million short tons) of industrial pesticides are now used each year. Seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries, but use in developing countries is increasing. A study of USA pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the National Science Foundation's Center for Integrated Pest Management.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a> wrote the best-selling book <i><a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a></i> about <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_magnification" title="Biological magnification">biological magnification</a>. The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stockholm_Convention" title="Stockholm Convention">Stockholm Convention</a> on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.</p>
