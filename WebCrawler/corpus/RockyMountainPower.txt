<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>
<p>PacifiCorp was formed in 1910 from the merger of several small electric companies in eastern Oregon and Washington to form the <b>Pacific Power &amp; Light Company</b>. It gradually expanded its reach to include most of Oregon, as well as portions of California, Washington and Wyoming. In 1984, it reorganized itself as a holding company, PacifiCorp, headquartered in Portland with Pacific Power as its main subsidiary.</p>
<p>In 1987, PacifiCorp acquired Utah Power &amp; Light. Headquartered in <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a>, Utah Power had been formed in 1912 from the merger of four electric companies in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. In 1881, one of those companies made Salt Lake City the fifth city in the world with <a href="/wiki/Central_station" title="Central station">central station</a> electricity.</p>
<p>After the merger, Pacific Power and Utah Power operated as divisions of PacifiCorp. In a July 2006 reorganization, Pacific Power's territory in central and eastern Wyoming was merged with the Utah Power territory to form Rocky Mountain Power.</p>
