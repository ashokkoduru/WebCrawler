<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_history">Early history</span></h3>
<p>At the time of European encounter, the inhabitants of the area that became Columbia were a people called the <a href="/wiki/Congaree_people" title="Congaree people">Congaree</a>. In May 1540, a Spanish expedition led by <a href="/wiki/Hernando_de_Soto" title="Hernando de Soto">Hernando de Soto</a> traversed what is now Columbia while moving northward. The expedition produced the earliest written historical records of the area, which was part of the regional <a href="/wiki/Cofitachequi" title="Cofitachequi">Cofitachequi</a> chiefdom.</p>
<p>From the creation of Columbia by the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina_General_Assembly" title="South Carolina General Assembly">South Carolina General Assembly</a> in 1786, the site of Columbia was important to the overall development of the state. The Congarees, a frontier fort on the west bank of the <a href="/wiki/Congaree_River" title="Congaree River">Congaree River</a>, was the head of navigation in the <a href="/wiki/Santee_River" title="Santee River">Santee River</a> system. A ferry was established by the colonial government in 1754 to connect the fort with the growing settlements on the higher ground on the east bank.</p>
<p>Like many other significant early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_fall_line" title="Atlantic Seaboard fall line">fall line</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)" title="Piedmont (United States)">Piedmont</a> region. The <a href="/wiki/Fall_line" title="Fall line">fall line</a> is the spot where a river becomes unnavigable when sailing upstream and where falling water downstream cannot power a mill.</p>
<p>State Senator <a href="/wiki/John_Lewis_Gervais" title="John Lewis Gervais">John Lewis Gervais</a> of the town of <a href="/wiki/Ninety_Six,_South_Carolina" title="Ninety Six, South Carolina">Ninety Six</a> introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22, 1786, to create a new state capital. There was considerable argument over the name for the new city. According to published accounts, Senator Gervais said he hoped that "in this town we should find refuge under the wings of <a href="/wiki/Columbia_(name)" title="Columbia (name)">COLUMBIA</a>", for that was the name which he wished it to be called. One legislator insisted on the name "Washington", but "Columbia" won by a vote of 11–7 in the state senate.</p>

<p>The site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786, due to its central location in the state. The State Legislature first met there in 1790. After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence, Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854.</p>
<p>Columbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to <a href="/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Santee_Canal" title="Santee Canal">Santee Canal</a>. This canal connected the Santee and Cooper rivers in a 22-mile-long (35 km) section. It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800, making it one of the earliest canals in the United States. With increased railroad traffic, it ceased operation around 1850.</p>
<p>The commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a 2-mile (3 km) square along the river. The blocks were divided into lots of 0.5 acres (2,000 m) and sold to speculators and prospective residents. Buyers had to build a house at least 30 feet (9.1 m) long and 18 feet (5.5 m) wide within three years or face an annual 5% penalty. The perimeter streets and two through streets were 150 feet (46 m) wide. The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares 100 feet (30 m) wide. The width was determined by the belief that dangerous and pesky <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> could not fly more than 60 feet (18 m) without dying of starvation along the way. Columbians still enjoy most of the magnificent network of wide streets.</p>

<p>The commissioners comprised the local government until 1797 when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly. Three main issues occupied most of their time: public drunkenness, gambling, and poor sanitation.</p>
<p>As one of the first <a href="/wiki/Planned_community" title="Planned community">planned cities</a> in the United States, Columbia began to grow rapidly. Its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the start of the 19th century.</p>

<p>In 1801, South Carolina College (now the <a href="/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina" title="University of South Carolina">University of South Carolina</a>) was founded in Columbia. The original building survives. The city was chosen as the site of the institution in part to unite the citizens of the <a href="/wiki/Upstate_South_Carolina" title="Upstate South Carolina">Upcountry</a> and the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina_Lowcountry" title="South Carolina Lowcountry">Lowcountry</a> and to discourage the youth from migrating to England for their higher education. At the time, South Carolina sent more young men to England than did any other state. The leaders of South Carolina wished to monitor the progress and development of the school; for many years after the founding of the university, commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session.</p>
<p>Columbia received its first charter as a town in 1805. An intendant and six wardens would govern the town. John Taylor, the first elected intendant, later served in both houses of the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually as governor. By 1816, there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand. Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was the lifeblood of the Columbia community; in 1850 virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.</p>
<p>"In 1830, approximately 1,500 <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" title="Slavery in the United States">slaves</a> lived and worked in Columbia; this population grew to 3,300 by 1860. Some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters' households. Masters also frequently hired out slaves to Columbia residents and institutions, including South Carolina College. Hired-out slaves sometimes returned to their owner's home daily; others boarded with their temporary masters." During this period, "legislators developed state and local statutes to restrict the movement of urban slaves in hopes of preventing rebellion. Although various decrees established <a href="/wiki/Curfew" title="Curfew">curfews</a> and prohibited slaves from meeting and from learning to read and write, such rulings were difficult to enforce." Indeed, "several prewar accounts note that many Columbia slaves were literate; some slaves even conducted classes to teach others to read and write." As well, "many slaves attended services at local Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches, yet some struggled to obtain membership in these institutions."</p>
<p>Columbia's <a href="/wiki/First_Baptist_Church_(Columbia,_South_Carolina)" title="First Baptist Church (Columbia, South Carolina)">First Baptist Church</a> hosted the South Carolina Secession Convention on December 17, 1860. The delegates drafted a resolution in favor of <a href="/wiki/Secession" title="Secession">secession</a>, 159–0. Columbia's location made it an ideal location for other conventions and meetings within <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">the Confederacy</a>.</p>

<p>On February 17, 1865, in the last months of the Civil War, much of Columbia was <a href="/wiki/Capture_of_Columbia" title="Capture of Columbia">destroyed by fire</a> while being occupied by <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union</a> troops under the command of General <a href="/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman" title="William Tecumseh Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>. Jeff Goodwyn, mayor of Columbia, sent William B. Stanley and Thomas W. Radcliffe to surrender the city to Sherman's troops. According to legend, Columbia's First Baptist Church barely missed being torched by Sherman's troops. The soldiers marched up to the church and asked the sexton if he could direct them to the First Baptist Church. The sexton directed the men to the nearby Washington Street Methodist Church; thus, the historic landmark was saved from destruction by Union soldiers, and the sexton preserved his employment at the cost of another.</p>

<p>Controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended. General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton, which had been stacked in the streets. General Sherman denied ordering the burning, though he did order militarily significant structures, such as the Confederate Printing Plant, destroyed. Firsthand accounts by local residents, Union soldiers, and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by Union troops for Columbia's and South Carolina's pivotal role in leading Southern states to secede from the <a href="/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a>. Still other accounts portray it as mostly the fault of the Confederacy. Today, tourists can follow the path General Sherman's army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire.</p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstruction</a>, Columbia became the focus of considerable attention. Reporters, journalists, travelers, and tourists flocked to South Carolina's capital city to witness a Southern state legislature whose members included former slaves. The city also made somewhat of a rebound following the devastating fire of 1865; a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction, and repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created jobs for area citizens.</p>
<p>Following Reconstruction, the Columbia Music Festival Association (CMFA) was established in 1897, by Mayor William McB. Sloan and the aldermen of the city of Columbia. It was headquartered in the Opera House on Main Street, which was also City Hall. Its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>
<p>The first few years of the 20th century saw Columbia emerge as a regional textile manufacturing center. In 1907, Columbia had six mills in operation: <a href="/wiki/Richland_Cotton_Mill" title="Richland Cotton Mill">Richland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Granby_Mill_Village_Historic_District" title="Granby Mill Village Historic District">Granby</a>, <a href="/wiki/Olympia_Mill" title="Olympia Mill">Olympia</a>, Capital City, Columbia, and Palmetto. Combined, they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of $819,000, giving the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Midlands_(South_Carolina)" title="Midlands (South Carolina)">Midlands</a> an economic boost of over $4.8 million. Columbia had no paved streets until 1908, when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced. There were, however, 115 publicly maintained street crossings at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks. As an experiment, Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks. This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains. The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925.</p>
<p>The years 1911 and 1912 were something of a construction boom for Columbia, with $2.5 million worth of construction occurring in the city. These projects included the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais, the <a href="/wiki/Palmetto_Building" title="Palmetto Building">Palmetto National Bank</a>, a shopping arcade, and large hotels at Main and Laurel (the Jefferson) and at Main and Wheat (the Gresham). In 1917, the city was selected as the site of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Jackson_(South_Carolina)" title="Fort Jackson (South Carolina)">Camp Jackson</a>, a U.S. military installation which was officially classified as a "Field Artillery Replacement Depot". The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1, 1917.</p>
<p>In 1930, Columbia was the hub of a trading area with approximately 500,000 potential customers. It had 803 retail establishments, 280 of them being food stores. There were also 58 clothing and apparel outlets, 57 restaurants and lunch rooms, 55 filling stations, 38 pharmacies, 20 furniture stores, 19 auto dealers, 11 shoe stores, nine cigar stands, five department stores and one book store. Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119, with one-third of them dealing in food.</p>
<p>In 1934, the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall. Built of granite from nearby <a href="/wiki/Winnsboro,_South_Carolina" title="Winnsboro, South Carolina">Winnsboro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Columbia_City_Hall_(South_Carolina)" title="Columbia City Hall (South Carolina)">Columbia City Hall</a> is listed on the <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. Designed by Alfred Built Millet, President <a href="/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s federal architect, the building was completed in 1876. Millet, best known for his design of the Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., had originally designed the building with a clock tower. Large cost overruns probably caused it to be left out. Copies of Mullet's original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of Columbia's beginnings. Federal offices were moved to the <a href="/wiki/J._Bratton_Davis_United_States_Bankruptcy_Courthouse" title="J. Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse">J. Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse</a>.</p>
<p>Reactivated Camp Jackson became <a href="/wiki/Fort_Jackson_(South_Carolina)" title="Fort Jackson (South Carolina)">Fort Jackson</a> in 1940, giving the military installation the permanence desired by city leaders at the time. The fort was annexed into the city in the fall of 1968, with approval from <a href="/wiki/The_Pentagon" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. In the early 1940s, shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor which began America's involvement in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Lt. Colonel <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle" title="Jimmy Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a> and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the <a href="/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" title="Doolittle Raid">Doolittle Raid</a> over Tokyo at what is now <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Metropolitan_Airport" title="Columbia Metropolitan Airport">Columbia Metropolitan Airport</a>. They trained in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/B-25_Mitchell" title="B-25 Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> bombers, the same model as the plane that now rests at Columbia's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Owens_Field" title="Owens Field">Owens Field</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Curtiss-Wright" title="Curtiss-Wright">Curtiss-Wright</a> hangar.  The area's population continued to grow during the 1950s, having experienced a 40 percent increase from 186,844 to 260,828, with 97,433 people residing within the city limits of Columbia.</p>

<p>The 1940s saw the beginning of efforts to reverse <a href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" title="Jim Crow laws">Jim Crow laws</a> and <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racial discrimination</a> in Columbia. In 1945, a federal judge ruled that the city's black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts. However, in years following, the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials. Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">voting rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Racial_segregation" title="Racial segregation">segregation</a> (particularly regarding public schools). On August 21, 1962, eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time. The <a href="/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina" title="University of South Carolina">University of South Carolina</a> admitted its first black students in 1963; around the same time, many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city, blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions, and a non-discriminatory hiring policy was adopted by the city. These and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964 <a href="/wiki/All-America_City_Award" title="All-America City Award">All-America City Award</a> for the second time (the first being in 1951), and a 1965 article in <i><a href="/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> magazine lauded Columbia as a city that had "liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal <a href="/wiki/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>."</p>
<p>Historic preservation has played a significant part in shaping Columbia into the city that it is today. The historic <a href="/wiki/Robert_Mills_House" title="Robert Mills House">Robert Mills House</a> was restored in 1967, which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures such as the <a href="/wiki/Hampton-Preston_House" title="Hampton-Preston House">Hampton-Preston House</a> and homes associated with President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maxcy_Gregg" title="Maxcy Gregg">Maxcy Gregg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Boykin_Chesnut" title="Mary Boykin Chesnut">Mary Boykin Chesnut</a>, and noted free black Celia Mann. In the early 1970s, the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its "Horseshoe". Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time, among them the Fort Jackson Museum, the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina, and most notably the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina_State_Museum" title="South Carolina State Museum">South Carolina State Museum</a>, which opened in 1988.</p>
<p>Mayor Kirkman Finlay, Jr., was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park, now known as <a href="/wiki/Finlay_Park" title="Finlay Park">Finlay Park</a>, in the historic Congaree Vista district, as well as the compilation of the $60 million Palmetto Center package, which gave Columbia an office tower, parking garage, and the Columbia Marriott, which opened in 1983. The year 1980 saw the Columbia metropolitan population reach 410,088, and in 1990 this figure had hit approximately 470,000.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_history">Recent history</span></h3>

<p>The 1990s and early 2000s saw revitalization in the downtown area. The <a href="/wiki/Congaree_Vista" title="Congaree Vista">Congaree Vista</a> district along Gervais Street, once known as a <a href="/wiki/Warehouse_district" title="Warehouse district">warehouse district</a>, became a thriving district of art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Life_Arena" title="Colonial Life Arena">Colonial Life Arena</a> (formerly known as the Colonial Center) opened in 2002, and brought several big-named concerts and shows to Columbia. <a href="/wiki/EdVenture" title="EdVenture">EdVenture</a>, the largest children's museum in the Southeast, opened in 2003. The Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center opened in 2004, and a new convention center hotel opened in September 2007. A public-private City Center Partnership has been formed to implement the downtown revitalization and boost downtown growth. Mayor <a href="/wiki/Stephen_K._Benjamin" title="Stephen K.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography_and_climate">Geography and climate</span></h2>

<p>One of Columbia's more prominent geographical features is its <a href="/wiki/Fall_line" title="Fall line">fall line</a>, the boundary between the upland <a href="/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)" title="Piedmont (United States)">Piedmont region</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atlantic_Coastal_Plain" title="Atlantic Coastal Plain">Atlantic Coastal Plain</a>, across which rivers drop as falls or rapids. Columbia grew up at the fall line of the Congaree River, which is formed by the convergence of the <a href="/wiki/Broad_River_(Carolinas)" title="Broad River (Carolinas)">Broad River</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Saluda_River" title="Saluda River">Saluda River</a>. The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation. The energy of falling water also powered Columbia's early <a href="/wiki/Cotton_mill" title="Cotton mill">mills</a>. The city has capitalized on this location which includes three rivers by christening itself "The Columbia Riverbanks Region". Columbia is located roughly halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the <a href="/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains" title="Blue Ridge Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> and sits at an elevation of around 292 ft (89 m).</p>
<p>Soils in Columbia are well drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be yellowish red sandy clay loam (Orangeburg series), yellowish brown sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the <a href="/wiki/Ultisol" title="Ultisol">Ultisol</a> soil order.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of 134.9 square miles (349.5 km), of which 132.2 square miles (342.4 km) is land and 2.7 square miles (7.0 km) is water (2.01%). Approximately ⅔ of Columbia's land area, 81.2 square miles (210 km), is contained within the Fort Jackson Military Installation, much of which consists of uninhabited training grounds. The actual inhabited area for the city is slightly more than 50 square miles (130 km).</p>
<p>Columbia has a <a href="/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate" title="Humid subtropical climate">humid subtropical climate</a> (<a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification" title="Köppen climate classification">Köppen</a> <i>Cfa</i>), with mild winters, early springs, warm autumns, and very hot and humid summers. The area averages 53 nights below freezing, but extended cold or days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing are both rare. With an annual average of 5.4 days with 100 °F (38 °C)+ and 77 days with 90 °F (32 °C)+ temperatures, the city's current promotional slogan describes Columbia as "Famously Hot". Precipitation, at 44.6 inches (1,130 mm) annually, peaks in the summer months, and is the least during spring and fall. Snowfall averages 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), but many years receive no snowfall. Like much of the southeastern U.S., the city is prone to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperature_inversion" title="Temperature inversion">inversions</a>, which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area.</p>
<p>Official extremes in temperature have ranged from 109 °F (43 °C) on <a href="/wiki/Summer_2012_North_American_heat_wave" title="Summer 2012 North American heat wave">June 29 and 30, 2012</a> down to −2 °F (−19 °C), set on <a href="/wiki/Great_Blizzard_of_1899" title="Great Blizzard of 1899">February 14, 1899</a>, although a close second of −1 °F (−18 °C) was recorded on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/January_1985_Arctic_outbreak" title="January 1985 Arctic outbreak">January 21, 1985</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina" title="University of South Carolina">University of South Carolina</a> campus reached 113 °F (45 °C) on June 29, 2012, establishing a new state record high.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Downtown_revitalization">Downtown revitalization</span></h3>

<p>The city of Columbia has recently accomplished a number of urban redevelopment projects and has several more planned. The historic <a href="/wiki/Congaree_Vista" title="Congaree Vista">Congaree Vista</a>, a 1,200-acre (5 km) district running from the central business district toward the Congaree River, features a number of historic buildings that have been rehabilitated since its revitalization begun in the late 1980s. Of note is the <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_reuse" title="Adaptive reuse">adaptive reuse</a> of the Confederate Printing Plant on Gervais and Huger, used to print Confederate bills during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. The city cooperated with <a href="/wiki/Publix" title="Publix">Publix</a> grocery stores to preserve the look. This won Columbia an award from the International Downtown Association. The Vista district is also where the region's convention center and anchor <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hilton_Hotels" title="Hilton Hotels">Hilton</a> hotel with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ruth%27s_Chris_Steakhouse" title="Ruth's Chris Steakhouse">Ruth's Chris Steakhouse</a> restaurant are located. Other notable developments under construction and recently completed include high-end condos and townhomes, hotels, and mixed-use structures.</p>

<p>The older buildings lining the Vista's main thoroughfare, Gervais Street, now house art galleries, restaurants, unique shops, and professional office space. Near the end of Gervais is the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina_State_Museum" title="South Carolina State Museum">South Carolina State Museum</a> and the EdVenture Children's Museum. Private student housing and some residential projects are going up nearby; the CanalSide development at the site of the old Central Correctional Institution, is the most high-profile. At full build-out, the development will have 750 residential units and provides access to Columbia's waterfront. Lady Street between Huger and Assembly streets in the Vista and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_Points_(Columbia)" title="Five Points (Columbia)">Five Points neighborhood</a> have undergone beautification projects, which mainly consisted of replacing curbs and gutters, and adding brick-paved sidewalks and angled parking.</p>
<p>Special revitalization efforts are being aimed at Main Street, which began seeing an exodus of department and specialty stores in the 1990s. The goal is to re-establish Main Street as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, and the stretch of Main Street home to most businesses—-from Gervais to Blanding streets—-has been streetscaped in recent years. Notable developments completed in recent years along Main Street include an 18-story, $60 million tower at the high-profile corner of Main and Gervais streets, the renovation of the 1441 Main Street office building as the new Midlands headquarters for <a href="/wiki/Wells_Fargo" title="Wells Fargo">Wells Fargo</a> Bank (formerly <a href="/wiki/Wachovia" title="Wachovia">Wachovia</a> Bank), a new sanctuary for the Holy Trinity <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" title="Greek Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> Church, the location of Mast General store in the historic <a href="/wiki/Efird%27s_Department_Store" title="Efird's Department Store">Efird's building</a>, and the relocation of the Nickelodeon theater. A façade improvement program for the downtown business district, implemented in 2011, has resulted in the restoration and improvement of the façades of several historic Main Street shopfronts. One of the most ambitious development projects in the city's history is currently underway which involves old state mental health campus downtown on Bull Street. Known formally as Columbia Common, this project will consist of rehabbing several historic buildings on the campus for residential, hospitality, and retail use. A new minor league baseball stadium was recently built on the campus as well.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Parks_and_recreation">Parks and recreation</span></h2>

<p>The region's most popular park, <a href="/wiki/Finlay_Park" title="Finlay Park">Finlay Park</a> has hosted just about everything from festivals and political rallies to road races and Easter Sunrise services. This 18-acre (73,000 m) park has had two lives; first dedicated in 1859 as Sidney Park, named in honor of Algernon Sidney Johnson, a Columbia City Councilman, the park experienced an illustrious but short tenure. The park fell into disrepair after the Civil War and served as a site for commercial ventures until the late 20th century. In 1990, the park was reopened. It serves as the site for such events as Kids Day, The Summer Concert Series, plus many more activities. In 1992, the park was renamed Finlay Park, in honor of Kirkman Finlay, a past mayor of Columbia who had a vision to reenergize the historic Congaree Vista district, between Main Street and the river, and recreate the site that was formerly known as Sidney Park.</p>

<p>Memorial Park is a 4-acre (16,000 m) tract of land in the Congaree Vista between Main Street and the river. The property is bordered by Hampton, Gadsden, Washington, and Wayne Streets and is one block south of Finlay Park. This park was created to serve as a memorial to those who served their country and presently has monuments honoring the <a href="/wiki/USS_Columbia" title="USS Columbia">USS Columbia</a> warship and those that served with her during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the China-Burma-India Theater Veterans of WWII, casualties of the <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> attack of December 7, 1941, who were from South Carolina, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holocaust_survivors" title="Holocaust survivors">Holocaust survivors</a> who live in South Carolina as well as concentration camp liberators from South Carolina, and the State <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> Veterans. The park was dedicated in November 1986 along with the unveiling of the South Carolina Vietnam Monument. In June 2000, the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> Memorial was dedicated at Memorial Park. In November 2014, Columbia native and resident of Boston, Henry Crede, gave a bronze statue and plaza in the park dedicated to his WWII comrades who served in the Navy from South Carolina.</p>
<p>Granby Park opened in November 1998 as a gateway to the rivers of Columbia, adding another access to the many river activities available to residents. Granby is part of the Three Rivers Greenway, a system of green spaces along the banks of the rivers in Columbia, adding another piece to the long-range plan and eventually connecting to the existing Riverfront Park. Granby is a 24-acre (97,000 m) linear park with canoe access points, fishing spots, bridges, and ½ mile of nature trail along the banks of the Congaree River.</p>
<p>In the Five Points district of downtown Columbia is the park dedicated to the legacy and memory of the most celebrated civil rights leader in America, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr." title="Martin Luther King Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> Park. Formerly known as Valley Park, it was historically known to be largely restricted to Whites. Renaming the park after Martin Luther King Jr. in the late 1980s was seen as a progressive and unifying event on behalf of the city, civic groups, and local citizens. The park features a beautiful water sculpture and a community center. An integral element of the park is the Stone of Hope monument, unveiled in January 1996. Upon the monument is inscribed a portion of King's 1964 <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> acceptance speech: "History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued that self-defeating path of hate. Love is the key to the solutions of the problems of the world."</p>
<p>One of Columbia's greatest assets is <a href="/wiki/Riverbanks_Zoo" title="Riverbanks Zoo">Riverbanks Zoo &amp; Garden</a>. Riverbanks Zoo is a sanctuary for more than 2,000 animals housed in natural habitat exhibits along the Saluda River. Just across the river, the 70-acre (280,000 m) botanical garden is devoted to gardens, woodlands, plant collections, and historic ruins. Riverbanks has been named one of America's best zoos and the No. 1 travel attraction in the Southeast. It attracted over one million visitors in 2009.</p>
<p>Situated along the meandering Congaree River in central South Carolina, <a href="/wiki/Congaree_National_Park" title="Congaree National Park">Congaree National Park</a> is home to champion trees, primeval forest landscapes, and diverse plant and animal life. This 22,200-acre (90 km) park protects the largest contiguous tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States. The park is an international <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biosphere_reserve" title="Biosphere reserve">biosphere reserve</a>. Known for its giant hardwoods and towering pines, the park's floodplain forest includes one of the highest canopies in the world and some of the tallest trees in the eastern United States. Congaree National Park provides a sanctuary for plants and animals, a research site for scientists, and a place to walk and relax in a tranquil wilderness setting.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sesquicentennial_State_Park" title="Sesquicentennial State Park">Sesquicentennial State Park</a> is a 1,419-acre (6 km) park, featuring a beautiful 30-acre (120,000 m) lake surrounded by trails and picnic areas. The park's proximity to downtown Columbia and three major interstate highways attracts both local residents and travelers. Sesquicentennial is often the site of family reunions and group campouts. Interpretive nature programs are a major attraction to the park. The park also contains a two-story log house, dating back to the mid 18th century, which was relocated to the park in 1969. This house is believed to be the oldest building still standing in Richland County. The park was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Evidence of their craftsmanship is still present today.</p>
<p>In November 1996, the River Alliance proposed that a 12-mile (19 km) linear park system be created to link people to their rivers. This was named the Three Rivers Greenway, and the $18 million estimated cost was agreed to by member governments (the cities of <a href="/wiki/Cayce,_South_Carolina" title="Cayce, South Carolina">Cayce</a>, Columbia, and <a href="/wiki/West_Columbia,_South_Carolina" title="West Columbia, South Carolina">West Columbia</a>) with the proviso that the Alliance recommend an acceptable funding strategy.</p>
<p>While the funding process was underway, an existing city of Columbia site located on the <a href="/wiki/Congaree_River" title="Congaree River">Congaree River</a> offered an opportunity to be a pilot project for the Three Rivers Greenway. The Alliance was asked to design and permit for construction by a general contractor this component. This approximately one-half-mile segment of the system was opened in November 1998. It is complete with 8-foot (2.4 m) wide concrete pathways, vandal-proof lighting, trash receptacles, water fountains, picnic benches, overlooks, bank fishing access, canoe/kayak access, a public restroom and parking. These set the standards for the common elements in the rest of the system. Eventually, pathways will run from Granby to the Riverbanks Zoo. Boaters, sportspeople, and fisherpeople will have access to the area, and additional recreational uses are being planned along the miles of riverfront.</p>

<p>Running beside the historic <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Canal" title="Columbia Canal">Columbia Canal</a>, Riverfront Park hosts a two and a half-mile trail. Spanning the canal is an old railway bridge that now is a pedestrian walkway. The park is popular for walking, running, bicycling, and fishing. <a href="/wiki/Picnic_table" title="Picnic table">Picnic tables</a> and benches dot the walking trail. Markers are located along the trail so that visitors can measure distance. The park is part of the Palmetto Trail, a hiking and biking trail that stretches the entire length of the state, from <a href="/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina" title="Greenville, South Carolina">Greenville</a> to <a href="/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a>.</p>
