<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p>An <b>address</b> is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using <a href="/wiki/Border" title="Border">political boundaries</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Street_name" title="Street name">street names</a> as references, along with other identifiers such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/House_number" title="House number">house</a> or <a href="/wiki/Apartment" title="Apartment">apartment</a> numbers.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Functions">Functions</span></h2>

<p>Addresses have several functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing a means of physically locating a building, especially in a city where there are many buildings and streets;</li>
<li>identifying buildings as the end points of a <a href="/wiki/Mail" title="Mail">postal system</a>;</li>
<li>signalling social status;</li>
<li>as parameters in statistics collection, especially in <a href="/wiki/Census" title="Census">census</a>-taking and the <a href="/wiki/Insurance" title="Insurance">insurance</a> industry;</li>
<li>addresses are the most accepted representation of a <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Location" title="Location">location</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addresses may have drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are a non-standardised means of representing a location;</li>
<li>They do not contain the coordinates of the location they represent.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>Until the advent of modern postal systems around the 18th-19th century, most houses and buildings were not numbered. <a href="/wiki/Street" title="Street">Streets</a> may have been named for landmarks, such as a city gate or market, or for the professions of their inhabitants. In many cities in <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, most minor streets were never named. This is still the case today in much of Japan. A local postman would be familiar with the area and thus able to deliver mail, but as postal systems developed, it became necessary to number buildings to aid in mail delivery.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="House_numbering_or_naming">House numbering or naming</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/House_numbering" title="House numbering">House numbering</a></div>
<p>In most English-speaking countries, the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in one direction along a street, with odd numbers on one side (often west or south or the left-hand side leading away from a main road) and even numbers on the other side, although there is significant variation on this basic pattern. Many older towns and cities in the UK have "up and down" numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road, and then sequentially back down the other side. Cities in <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, particularly those planned on a <a href="/wiki/Grid_plan" title="Grid plan">grid plan</a>, often incorporate <a href="/wiki/City_block" title="City block">block</a> numbers, quadrants (explained below), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cardinal_directions" title="Cardinal directions">cardinal directions</a> into their street numbers, so that in many such cities, addresses roughly follow a <a href="/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="Cartesian coordinate system">Cartesian coordinate system</a>. Some other cities around the world have their own schemes.</p>
<p>Although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world, it is also common for houses in the United Kingdom and <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> to be identified by name, rather than number, especially in villages. In these cases, the street name will usually follow the house name. Such an address might read: "Smith Cottage, Frog Lane, Barchester, Barsetshire, BZ9 9BA" or "Dunroamin, Emo, Co. Laois, Ireland" (fictional examples).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quadrants"><span id="cartesian"></span>Quadrants</span></h3>
<p>In cities with Cartesian-coordinate-based addressing systems, the streets that form the north-south and east-west dividing lines constitute the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_plane" title="Cartesian coordinate plane">Cartesian coordinate plane</a> and thus divide the city into <b>quadrants.</b> The quadrants are typically identified in the street names, although the manner of doing so varies from city to city. For example, in one city, all streets in the northeast quadrant may have "NE" prefixed or suffixed to their street names, while in another, the intersection of <i>North</i> Calvert Street and <i>East</i> 27th Street can be only in the northeast quadrant.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Street-naming_conventions">Street-naming conventions</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Street_name" title="Street name">Street names</a> may follow a variety of themes. In many <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> cities, such as, <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> USA, and <a href="/wiki/Edmonton" title="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, Canada, streets are simply <a href="/wiki/Numbered_street" title="Numbered street">numbered sequentially</a> across the street grid. <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> has its <a href="/wiki/Numbered_street" title="Numbered street">numbered streets</a> running north-south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east-west, while diagonal avenues are typically named after states. In <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a>, and many other <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a> cities, streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks. A similar system is in use in <a href="/wiki/Detroit" title="Detroit">Detroit</a> with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mile_Road_System_(Detroit)" title="Mile Road System (Detroit)">Mile Road System</a>. In some housing developments in North America and elsewhere, street names may all follow the same theme (for example, bird species), or start with the same letter. Streets in <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">Continental Europe</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> are often named after famous people or significant dates.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_codes">Postal codes</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Postal_code" title="Postal code">Postal codes</a> are a relatively recent development in addressing, designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_alternatives_to_physical_addresses">Postal alternatives to physical addresses</span></h3>
<p>For privacy and other purposes, postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one's physical address or even having a fixed physical address. Examples are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_office_box" title="Post office box">post office boxes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Service_address" title="Service address">service addresses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Poste_restante" title="Poste restante">poste restante</a> (general delivery).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Address_format">Address format</span></h2>

<p>In most of the world, addresses are written in order from most specific to general, i.e. finest to coarsest information, starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit. For example:</p>

<p>In English-speaking countries, the <a href="/wiki/Postal_code" title="Postal code">postal code</a> usually comes last. In much of Europe, the code precedes the town name, thus: "1010 <a href="/wiki/Lausanne" title="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>". Often, the country code is still placed in front of the postal code: "<a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">CH</a>-1010 <a href="/wiki/Lausanne" title="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>". However, this is no longer demanded by postal authorities and has even been forbidden in certain countries.</p>
<p>If a house number is provided, it is written on the same line as the street name; a house name is written on the previous line. When addresses are written inline, line breaks are replaced by commas. Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ: either before or after the street name. Similarly, there are differences in the placement of postal codes: in the UK, they are written on a separate line at the end of the address; in Australia, Canada and the United States, they usually appear immediately after the state or province, on the same line; in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city, on the same line.</p>
<p><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=East_Asian_addressing_system&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="East Asian addressing system (page does not exist)">East Asian addressing systems</a>, including Chinese, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system" title="Japanese addressing system">Japanese</a> and Korean addressing systems, when written in their native scripts, use the opposite ordering, starting with the province/prefecture, ending with the addressee. However both have the same order as western countries when written in the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units, except the name of the addressee is put into the first line.</p>
<p>The Universal Postal Convention strongly recommends the following:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mailing_address_format_by_country">Mailing address format by country</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Argentina">Argentina</span></h3>
<p>In Argentina, an address must be mailed this way:</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Argentina" title="Postal codes in Argentina">postal code</a> has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format, which is shown in the example. The new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning, which allows it to be identified. As the system has been changed recently, the four digit format can still be used: in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Australia">Australia</span></h3>
<p>In common with the rest of the English-speaking world, addresses in Australia put the street number—which may be a range—before the street name, and the placename before the postcode. Unlike addresses in most other comparable places, the city is not included in the address, but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used, usually referred to in Australia as a <a href="/wiki/Suburbs_and_localities_(Australia)" title="Suburbs and localities (Australia)">suburb or town</a> – although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries. Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type, the <a href="/wiki/Postcodes_in_Australia" title="Postcodes in Australia">postcode</a> serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address. As an example, there are around 8000 localities in Victoria (cf. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_localities_in_Victoria_(Australia)" title="List of localities in Victoria (Australia)">List of localities in Victoria (Australia)</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Melbourne_suburbs" title="List of Melbourne suburbs">List of Melbourne suburbs</a>), yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes. For certain large volume receivers or post offices, the "locality" may be an institution or street name. It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address (unless this happens to be the name of the suburb), and doing so may delay delivery.</p>
<p>Australia Post recommends that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters. In Australia, subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces; apartments, flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash instead. As in the US, the state/territory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different states/territories; it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated. In printed matter, the postcode follows after two spaces; in handwritten matter, the postcode should be written in the boxes provided.</p>

<p>In addition to PO Boxes, other delivery types (which are typically abbreviated) may include:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Belarus">Belarus</span></h3>
<p>Some neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don't face a named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, a "main" building may have the same number as one or more "subsidiary" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as <i>vul. Lenina, d. 123</i> (<i>123 Lenin St</i>) An address may also cover one or more <i>subsidiary buildings</i> behind the main building, addressed as <i>vul. Lenina, d. 123, bud. 2</i> (<i>123 Lenin St, unit 2</i>, where <i>bud.</i> (abbreviation for будынак, <i>budynak</i>) means a '(subsidiary) building'). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that don't face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g. <i>123-а</i>, <i>123-б</i>, etc., in <a href="/wiki/Cyrillic_script" title="Cyrillic script">Cyrillic alphabetical</a> order.</p>
<p>In some <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microraion" title="Microraion">microraion</a></i> neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the <i>microraion</i> (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at <i>4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56</i>, i.e. <i>123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Belgium">Belgium</span></h3>
<p>The address starts with the most specific information (addressee individual identification) and ends with the most general information (postcode and town for domestic mail or country for cross border mail.) Spatial information of a physical address (including building, wing, stairwell, floor and door) may be useful for internal path of delivery, but is not allowed in the delivery point location line (i.e. the line containing street, number and box number). If needed, this information will appear on a line above the delivery point location line.</p>
<p>The street number is placed after the thoroughfare name (unlike in France), separated by a space. Separators such as punctuation (point, comma or other signs) or ‘n°’, or ‘nr’ are not allowed. Extension designation (box numbers), if present, appears in the delivery point location line, preceded by the word for "box" (<i>bus</i> in Dutch, <i>bte</i> in French). Symbols such as <i>b</i>, <i>Bt</i>, <i>#</i>, <i>-</i>, <i>/</i> are not allowed as separators between the street number element and the box number element.</p>
<p>Example of a correctly formatted postal address:</p>

<p>The Belgian addressing guidelines are registered with the Universal Postal Union (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UPU" title="UPU">UPU</a> and see the link <a class="external free" href="http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html</a>). These guidelines indicate exactly how to combine the various address components in order to obtain a correctly formatted postal address.</p>
<p>The complete set of addressing guidelines can be found on the website of the Belgian postal operator (bpost). The correct representation of an address is not limited to the correct structure of address components but also relates to the content of addresses and their position on envelopes (see <a class="external free" href="http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/letters-cards/send/best_practices.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/letters-cards/send/best_practices.html</a> (in French)).</p>
<p>It is also possible to validate a Belgian postal address on bpost's website and to receive feedback on the content and the format of an address. More information can be found on bpost's website (see <a class="external text" href="http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/customerservice/search/address.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bpost.be/validationadresse/</a> (in French)).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Brazil">Brazil</span></h3>
<p>In Brazil, an address must be mailed this way:</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/States_of_Brazil" title="States of Brazil">States</a> can have their name written entirely, abbreviated in some way, or totally abbreviated to two letters (SP = <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)" title="São Paulo (state)">São Paulo</a>, RJ = <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)" title="Rio de Janeiro (state)">Rio de Janeiro</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>Only towns with 60,000 inhabitants and above have postal codes individualized for streets, roads, avenues, etc. One way can have several postal codes (by odd/even numbers side or by segment). These postcodes range from -000 to -899. Other towns have only a generic postcode with the suffix -000. Recipients of bulk mail (large companies, condos, etc.) have specific postcodes, with a suffix ranging from -900 to -959. P.O. boxes are mailed to <i>Correios</i> offices, with suffixes ranging from -970 to -979. Some rural settlements have communitarian postboxes with suffix -990.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h3>
<p>Addressing guidelines can differ between English- and French-speaking populations in Canada. Here are some formatting rules that are used in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardinal directions like <i>North</i>, <i>North West</i>, etc. can be abbreviated in either English or French, and appear after the street name. Ordinal numbered streets (e.g. 6th, 2nd) can be written in either English or French.</li>
<li>Postal codes come in a letter-number-letter-space-number-letter-number format, for example: A1A 1A1. There should be two spaces between the province abbreviation and the postal code.</li>
<li>If sending a parcel from outside Canada, the word "CANADA" must be placed at the very bottom.</li>
<li>If there is an apartment number it should be written before the house number and separated by a hyphen. The postal code is then separated by two spaces and should be written on the same line as the city and province.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chile">Chile</span></h3>
<p>Chilean urban addresses require only the street name, house number, apartment number (if necessary) and municipality; however, more information is frequently included, such as neighbourhood, city, region. Postal codes are rarely included by people. All postal codes have seven digits, the first three indicating the municipality, the next four identifying a block or in large and scarcely populated areas a quadrant within the municipal territory.</p>
<p>The territories of most of the larger cities comprise several adjacent municipalities, so it is important to mention it.</p>

<p>Smaller cities often consist of only one municipality with several unofficial neighbourhoods that are usually mentioned even for official addressing purposes.</p>

<p>Several large and mostly rural municipalities contain more than one small town, in such cases, the recipient address must mention either the town, the postal code or both.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="China">China</span></h3>
<p>The Postal area when written in Chinese characters (preferably <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_character" title="Simplified Chinese character">Simplified Chinese characters</a>), has the order of the largest unit first, ending with the addressee, i.e. country, province, municipality, town, street or road, building name, floor/level, house/flat number, company name, addressee. This is the most common language used when posting within <a href="/wiki/Mainland_China" title="Mainland China">China</a>.</p>

<p>The whole address is commonly written as a string of characters with no particular format regarding where a new line would start, similar to one long sentence, with any new lines appearing depending on the space available on the envelope. Generally, the district is omitted when posting within China.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Croatia">Croatia</span></h3>

<p>Croatia uses five-digit postal code numbers. The Croatian postal service recommends using 2-letter ISO country codes as prefixes before international and domestic postal codes, though the practice is not mandatory.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</span></h3>
<p>Common format in Czech Republic:</p>

<p>Postal codes are in the format "### ##" (i.e. 158 00 = Prague 58) or "CZ-#####" (especially for international sendings). At pre-printed Czech postcards and envelopes, the postal code is filled into frames at separate last row. If the envelope doesn't have pre-printed rows and frames, the postal code should be before the town (or post office) name.</p>
<p>In private mails, the first line is usually constituted by a courtesy title (pan, paní, slečna, žák…) For private mails addressed to the workplace, the order is inverse (name + company) as in official mails (company + name).</p>
<p>The basic system of <a href="/wiki/House_numbering" title="House numbering">house numbering</a> are conscription house numbers (čísla popisná, čp. or č. p.). In case of temporary or recreational house, an evidentional house number (číslo evidenční, ev. č. or če., or distinguished by initial 0 or E prefix) is used instead. In most of bigger cities and also in some towns and big villages with street names, there is double system of house numbering. As the first number is used the conscription or evidentional number (which corresponds to the chronologic order of cadastral registration of the house), as the second number (past a slash) is used the orientational number (orientační číslo, č. or., č. o.) which expresses position on the street. Sometimes, only one of the two numbers is used or the numbers are used in inversed order and it can be difficult to distinguish which number is which. Generally, orientation numbers (if exists) are preferred for mail services.</p>

<p>In Denmark, apartment buildings will usually have two or three apartments per floor. Thus, if the addressee lives in an apartment, the address should contain the floor they live on, and a side (<i>t.v.</i>, <i>mf.</i> or <i>t.h.</i>, meaning "to the left", "in the middle" and "to the right", respectively) or an alphanumeric character (1,2,3... or A,B,C...= starting from left seen from the top most step just before the floor).</p>
<p>Also, for postal codes 2000 and up, there is a 1:1 relationship between postal code and town.</p>

<p>When written in the Latin alphabet, the address begins with the smallest geographical area and ends with the largest one as in the following example. Macrons (as on ō and ū) may be omitted.</p>
<p>Japanese-style envelopes are vertically aligned and the address is written from top to bottom, then right to left. Western-style envelopes are horizontally aligned and the address is written from left to right, top to bottom.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mexico">Mexico</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Correos_de_M%C3%A9xico" title="Correos de México">Correos de México</a> recommends the following formats:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Netherlands">Netherlands</span></h3>
<p>In the Netherlands, the address is generally formatted as follows:</p>

<p>The postal code is a unique street identifier, and always consists of four numbers followed by a space and then two capital letters. <a href="/wiki/PostNL" title="PostNL">PostNL</a>, which is appointed by the Dutch government to carry out the UPD (Dutch for <i>Universal Postal Service</i>), recommends putting two spaces between postal code and town. Also, the name of the town should be written in capitals.</p>
<p>Because the Dutch postal code uniquely identifies a street, a shortened format may also be used. This method only needs the postal code and the number. The ideal format for this method is the number after the postal code, meaning that this: '5631 AV 1092' will still get the letter delivered to the correct location.</p>
<p>It is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. "postbus 1200") or <a href="/wiki/Freepost" title="Freepost">freepost</a> number (e.g. "antwoordnummer 150"), which have their own postal code.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Zealand">New Zealand</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Post" title="New Zealand Post">New Zealand Post</a> recommends the following format:</p>

<p>Note that no space or full stops exists between P and O in PO Box or R and D in RD. One should put only one space between the town/city and the postcode.</p>
<p>Note for <a href="/wiki/Wellington" title="Wellington">Wellington</a> metropolitan area, users should use the city name (i.e. Wellington, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, Porirua), not the metropolitan area name. For example:</p>

<p>The city in this case is important, as if Wellington is used instead of Lower Hutt and the postcode is unclear (note only the first digit differs), someone's private mail could accidentally be sent to the <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament_Buildings" title="New Zealand Parliament Buildings">New Zealand Parliament Buildings</a> instead (or vice versa).</p>
<p>One anomaly about this system is the Wellington Mail Centre, which is addressed as <i>Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045</i>, due to its location in the Lower Hutt suburb of <a href="/wiki/Petone" title="Petone">Petone</a>.</p>

al. = Ave (Avenue)<br/>
pl. = Sq (Square, or Circus)</p>
<p>The abbreviation "m." (meaning "mieszkania" = "flat") can be used instead of "/" before the flat number.</p>
<p>The postal code always consists of five digits separated with a hyphen (in the "XX-XXX" format), i.e. 00-486 (00=Warsaw); 20-486 (20=Lublin), etc. The first digit signifies the postal district, the second: the code zone, the third: the code sector, the fourth and fifth signify the post office and its area of operation.

<p>Postal codes have the NNNN-NNN format. Street name and the number is traditionally separated by a comma, but nowadays <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CTT" title="CTT">CTT</a> recommends just a blank space, or two blank spaces for extra clarity; this is to avoid <a href="/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" title="Optical character recognition">OCR</a> mistakes. The º after the number is the ordinal for floor number. Usually followed by "Esq." (Left, abbr from "Esquerdo") or "Dir." (Right, abbr from "Direito"), or an apartment letter (A, B, C, etc.). PO Boxes are called Apartado, followed by a number (e.g., Apartado 1001).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Russia">Russia</span></h3>
<p>The address must be written in Cyrillic or Latin alphabet, in usual format (from most specific to general).</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<p><i>Note: sub-region and region names are void if the city is <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> or <a href="/wiki/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> or if it is sub-region administrative center.</i></p>
<p>Some neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings face no named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, such as the historical center of Moscow, a "main" building may have the same number as one or more "subsidiary" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as, for example, ul. Lenina, d. 123 (that is, 123 Lenin St). An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building, addressed as ul. Lenina, d. 123, str. 2 (123 Lenin St, Unit 2, where str. (abbreviation for строение, stroenie) means a '(subsidiary) building'. In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that face no named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, such as 123-а, 123-б, etc., in alphabetic order.</p>
<p>In some microraion neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the microraion (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at 4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56, that is, 123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56.</p>

<p>Generally, the last line <i>SINGAPORE</i> is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in the English language.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slovakia">Slovakia</span></h3>
<p>Common format in Slovakia:</p>

<p>Postal codes are in the format "### ##" (i.e. 851 01 = Bratislava 5).</p>
<p>Street numbers can be written as orientation numbers (related to street) or <a href="/wiki/House_numbering" title="House numbering">descriptive numbers</a> (unique within the town) or as a combination separated by a slash (descriptive/orientation). Descriptive numbers are also used within small villages that do not have named streets.</p>
<p>If the delivery is intended exclusively for a specific person at a company site, the address should begin with the individual's name and the company name should follow. The standard format of addresses enables anyone at the company to receive the delivery.</p>

<p>Some cities have more than one post office, thus having multiple postcodes (usually in the x1xx format). For example, Ljubljana which has a "general" postcode 1000, also has additional ones, ranging from 1101 to 1133 (for some reason, however, omitting 1103 and 1105), <a href="/wiki/Kamnik" title="Kamnik">Kamnik</a> has 1240 and 1241, etc. Albeit they exist, it is not necessary to use them - usually the "general" postcodes are used.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>The format specified by the postal operator <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mail" title="Royal Mail">Royal Mail</a> is as follows:</p>

<p>The locality is required only where its absence would cause ambiguity, for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets with the same name. Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals. Until 1996 a <a href="/wiki/Postal_counties_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Postal counties of the United Kingdom">postal county</a> (or permitted abbreviation) was required after the post town, unless it was a <a href="/wiki/Postal_counties_of_the_United_Kingdom#Special_post_towns" title="Postal counties of the United Kingdom">special post town</a>, for example <a href="/wiki/London_postal_district" title="London postal district">London</a>. The post town and postcode should each be on a separate line. Historically, each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line. Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre. The postcode identifies, from left to right, increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system. The first half of the postcode, known as the outward code, contains the <a href="/wiki/List_of_postcode_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom">postcode area</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_postcode_districts_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom">postcode district</a>. The second half, known as the inward code, contains the postcode sector and postcode unit.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, only the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) has been permitted to deliver to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/P.O._Box" title="P.O. Box">P.O. Box</a>. For this reason the recipient may choose to insert their physical (aka street) address as line two, expanding the complete address to four lines. Providing both allows a sender to ship via the USPS or via a private carrier. Some USPS facilities allow a user of a P.O. box to use the street address of the postal facility with the P.O. box number in the place of a suite number, in which case the user may receive packages from private carriers.</li>
<li>Mail will be delivered to the line immediately above the city, state, zip code line.</li>
<li>The state and type of street, e.g. <i>Lane</i>, is often abbreviated as shown in the PO standard.</li>
<li>The USPS discourages the use of all punctuation except the hyphen in ZIP+4 codes, slashes in fractional addresses, hyphenated street numbers, and periods in decimal addresses (e.g. the street name contains a decimal point). Hyphenated street numbers are common in the New York City borough of <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>, Hawaii, and Southern California; see <a href="/wiki/House_numbering" title="House numbering">house numbering</a>.</li>
<li>Sometimes the name of the town required by <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service</a> does not necessarily mean that address is within that city. See also <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ZIP_code#ZIP_codes_and_previous_zoning_lines" title="ZIP code">ZIP codes and previous zoning lines</a>.</li>
<li>Standards for variations on this format (apartment, rural route, general delivery, grid, P.O. Box and highway addresses) are covered in USPS Publication 28.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> addresses often include an urbanization or condominium name.</li>
<li>The USPS allows for Spanish conventions in addresses in Puerto Rico. The USPS prefers that territories be addressed in the standard domestic format (e.g. "San Juan PR 00907") but in practice territory names are sometimes written as if they are a country (e.g. "San Juan 00907 Puerto Rico").</li>
<li>International <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" title="United States Department of State">United States Department of State</a> mail will use "DPO" as the city; <a href="/wiki/Military_mail" title="Military mail">military mail</a> will use "APO" or "FPO". Both use "AE", "AP", or "AA" in place of the state code, depending on the continent.</li>
<li>Three independent countries with a <a href="/wiki/Compact_of_Free_Association" title="Compact of Free Association">Compact of Free Association</a> with the U.S. (<a href="/wiki/Palau" title="Palau">Palau</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia" title="Federated States of Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a>) have their own domestic government-run mail services, but are integrated into the USPS addressing and ZIP code system. (See <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service#International_services" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service#International services</a>.)</li>
