<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography">Biography</span></h2>
<p>James Lovelock was born in <a href="/wiki/Letchworth" title="Letchworth">Letchworth Garden City</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hertfordshire" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, England, to working class parents who were strong believers in education. Nell, his mother, started work at 13 in a pickle factory. His father, Tom, had served six months hard labour for poaching in his teens and was illiterate until attending technical college. The family moved to London where Lovelock's dislike of authority made him, by his own account, an unhappy pupil at <a href="/wiki/Strand_School" title="Strand School">Strand School</a>. Lovelock could not afford to go to university after school, something which he believes helped prevent him becoming over-specialised and aided the development of Gaia theory. He worked at a photography firm, attending <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Birkbeck_College" title="Birkbeck College">Birkbeck College</a> during the evenings, before being accepted to study chemistry at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Manchester" title="University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, where he was a student of the Nobel Prize laureate <a href="/wiki/Alexander_R._Todd" title="Alexander R. Todd">Professor Alexander Todd</a>. Lovelock worked at a Quaker farm before a recommendation from his professor led to him taking up a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medical_Research_Council_(UK)" title="Medical Research Council (UK)">Medical Research Council</a> post, working on ways of shielding soldiers from burns. Lovelock refused to use the shaved and anaesthetised rabbits that were used as burn victims, and exposed his own skin to heat radiation instead, an experience he describes as "exquisitely painful". His student status enabled temporary deferment of <a href="/wiki/Military_service" title="Military service">military service</a> during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, but he registered as a <a href="/wiki/Conscientious_objector" title="Conscientious objector">conscientious objector</a>. He later abandoned this position in the light of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> atrocities, and tried to enlist in the armed forces, but was told that his medical research was too valuable for the enlistment to be approved. In 1948 Lovelock received a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</a> degree in medicine at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/London_School_of_Hygiene_and_Tropical_Medicine" title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>. In the United States, he has conducted research at <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baylor_College_of_Medicine" title="Baylor College of Medicine">Baylor College of Medicine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>

<p>A lifelong inventor, Lovelock has created and developed many scientific instruments, some of which were designed for <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> in its program of planetary exploration. It was while working as a consultant for NASA that Lovelock developed the Gaia Hypothesis, for which he is most widely known. He also claims to have invented the <a href="/wiki/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave oven</a>.</p>
<p>In early 1961, Lovelock was engaged by NASA to develop sensitive instruments for the analysis of extraterrestrial atmospheres and planetary surfaces. The <a href="/wiki/Viking_program" title="Viking program">Viking program</a>, that visited <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> in the late 1970s, was motivated in part to determine whether Mars supported life, and many of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue. During work on a precursor of this program, Lovelock became interested in the composition of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Mars" title="Magnetosphere of Mars">Martian atmosphere</a>, reasoning that many life forms on Mars would be obliged to make use of it (and, thus, alter it). However, the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its <a href="/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium" title="Chemical equilibrium">chemical equilibrium</a>, with very little oxygen, methane, or hydrogen, but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide. To Lovelock, the stark contrast between the Martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of that of the Earth's biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on the planet. However, when they were finally launched to Mars, the Viking probes still searched (unsuccessfully) for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extant_taxon" title="Extant taxon">extant</a> life there.</p>

<p>Lovelock invented the <a href="/wiki/Electron_capture_detector" title="Electron capture detector">electron capture detector</a>, which ultimately assisted in discoveries about the persistence of <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">CFCs</a> and their role in <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratospheric</a> <a href="/wiki/Ozone_depletion" title="Ozone depletion">ozone depletion</a>. After studying the operation of the Earth's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sulphur_cycle" title="Sulphur cycle">sulphur cycle</a>, Lovelock and his colleagues, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Jay_Charlson" title="Robert Jay Charlson">Robert Jay Charlson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meinrat_Andreae" title="Meinrat Andreae">Meinrat Andreae</a> and Stephen G. Warren developed the <a href="/wiki/CLAW_hypothesis" title="CLAW hypothesis">CLAW hypothesis</a> as a possible example of biological control of the Earth's climate.</p>
<p>Lovelock was elected a Fellow of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> in 1974. He served as the president of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_Biological_Association" title="Marine Biological Association">Marine Biological Association</a> (MBA) from 1986 to 1990, and has been an Honorary Visiting Fellow of <a href="/wiki/Green_Templeton_College,_Oxford" title="Green Templeton College, Oxford">Green Templeton College, Oxford</a> (formerly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_College,_Oxford" title="Green College, Oxford">Green College, Oxford</a>) since 1994. He has been awarded a number of prestigious prizes including the Tswett Medal (1975), an <a href="/wiki/American_Chemical_Society" title="American Chemical Society">American Chemical Society</a> chromatography award (1980), the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> Norbert Gerbier Prize (1988), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dr_A.H._Heineken_Prize" title="Dr A.H. Heineken Prize">Dr A.H. Heineken Prize</a> for the Environment (1990) and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society" title="Royal Geographical Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> Discovery Lifetime award (2001). In 2006 he received the <a href="/wiki/Wollaston_Medal" title="Wollaston Medal">Wollaston Medal</a>, the Geological Society's highest Award, whose previous recipients include Charles Darwin <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jameslovelock.org/page7.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a> in 1990, and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour" title="Order of the Companions of Honour">Companions of Honour</a> in 2003. He is a patron of population concern charity <a href="/wiki/Population_Matters" title="Population Matters">Population Matters</a>.</p>
<p>As an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gentleman_scientist" title="Gentleman scientist">independent scientist</a>, inventor, and author, Lovelock worked out of a barn-turned-laboratory he called his "experimental station" located in a wooded valley on the <a href="/wiki/Devon" title="Devon">Devon</a>/<a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> border in the south-west of England.</p>
<p>On 8 May 2012, he appeared on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radio_Four" title="Radio Four">Radio Four</a> series "The Life Scientific", talking to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jim_al-Khalili" title="Jim al-Khalili">Jim al-Khalili</a> about the Gaia hypothesis. On the program, he mentioned how his ideas had been received by various people, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jonathan_Porritt" title="Jonathan Porritt">Jonathan Porritt</a>. He also mentioned how he had a claim for inventing the <a href="/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwave</a> oven. He later explained this claim in an interview with <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=The_Manchester_Magazine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Manchester Magazine (page does not exist)">The Manchester Magazine</a>. Lovelock said that he did create an instrument during his time studying causes of damage to living cells and tissue, which had, according to him, "almost everything you would expect in an ordinary microwave oven". He invented the instrument for the purpose of heating up frozen hamsters in a way that caused less suffering to the animals, as opposed to the traditional way which involved putting red hot spoons on the animals' chest to heat them up. He believes that at the time, nobody had gone that far and made an embodiment of an actual microwave oven. However, he does not claim to have been the first person to have the idea of using microwaves for cooking.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_radical_halogenation" title="Free radical halogenation">Free radical halogenation</a></div>
<p>After the development of his <a href="/wiki/Electron_capture_detector" title="Electron capture detector">electron capture detector</a>, in the late 1960s, Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. He found a concentration of 60 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_trillion" title="Parts per trillion">parts per trillion</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CFC-11" title="CFC-11">CFC-11</a> over Ireland and, in a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972, went on to measure the concentration of CFC-11 from the northern hemisphere to the Antarctic aboard the <a href="/wiki/Research_vessel" title="Research vessel">research vessel</a> <a href="/wiki/RRS_Shackleton" title="RRS Shackleton">RRS <i>Shackleton</i></a>. He found the gas in each of the 50 air samples that he collected but, not realising that the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere would release <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> that posed a threat to the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>, concluded that the level of CFCs constituted "no conceivable hazard". He has since stated that he meant "no conceivable toxic hazard".</p>
<p>However, the experiment did provide the first useful data on the ubiquitous presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused to the ozone layer by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photolysis" title="Photolysis">photolysis</a> of CFCs was later discovered by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frank_Sherwood_Rowland" title="Frank Sherwood Rowland">Sherwood Rowland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mario_J._Molina" title="Mario J. Molina">Mario Molina</a>. After hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's results, Sherwood and Molina embarked on research that resulted in the first published paper that suggested a link between stratospheric CFCs and <a href="/wiki/Ozone_depletion" title="Ozone depletion">ozone depletion</a> in 1974 (for which they later shared the 1995 <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize in Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> with <a href="/wiki/Paul_J._Crutzen" title="Paul J. Crutzen">Paul Crutzen</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gaia">Gaia</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis" title="Gaia hypothesis">Gaia hypothesis</a></div>
<p>First formulated by Lovelock during the 1960s as a result of work for <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> concerned with detecting life on Mars, the Gaia hypothesis proposes that living and non-living parts of the Earth form a <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" title="Cybernetics">complex interacting system</a> that can be thought of as a single <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a>. Named after the <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greek_primordial_gods" title="Greek primordial gods">goddess</a> <a href="/wiki/Gaia_(mythology)" title="Gaia (mythology)">Gaia</a> at the suggestion of novelist <a href="/wiki/William_Golding" title="William Golding">William Golding</a>, the hypothesis postulates that the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> has a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that acts to sustain life.</p>
<p>While the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gaia_theory_(science)" title="Gaia theory (science)">Gaia hypothesis</a> was readily accepted by many in the <a href="/wiki/Environmentalist" title="Environmentalist">environmentalist</a> community, it has not been widely accepted within the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_community" title="Scientific community">scientific community</a>. Among its most prominent critics are the evolutionary biologists <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Doolittle" title="Ford Doolittle">Ford Doolittle</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould" title="Stephen Jay Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> – notable, given the diversity of this trio's views on other scientific matters. These (and other) critics have questioned how <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> operating on individual organisms can lead to the evolution of planetary-scale <a href="/wiki/Homeostasis" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>.</p>
<p>In response to this — together with <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Watson_(scientist)" title="Andrew Watson (scientist)">Andrew Watson</a> — Lovelock published the computer model <a href="/wiki/Daisyworld" title="Daisyworld">Daisyworld</a> in 1983, that postulated a hypothetical <a href="/wiki/Planet" title="Planet">planet</a> orbiting a star whose radiant energy is <a href="/wiki/Geologic_time_scale" title="Geologic time scale">slowly</a> <a href="/wiki/Stellar_evolution" title="Stellar evolution">increasing or decreasing</a>. In the non-biological case, the temperature of this planet simply tracks the energy received from the star. However, in the biological case, ecological competition between "daisy" species with different albedo values produces a homeostatic effect on global temperature. When energy received from the star is low, black daisies proliferate since they absorb a greater fraction of the heat, while when energy input is high, white daisies are competitively advantaged since they reflect excess heat away. As the daisies, white and black, affect the planet's overall albedo and temperature, changes in their relative populations act to stabilise the planet's climate and to keep temperature within an optimal range despite changes in <a href="/wiki/Solar_constant" title="Solar constant">energy from the star</a>. Lovelock argued that Daisyworld, although a parable, illustrates how conventional natural selection operating on individual organisms can still produce planetary-scale homeostasis.</p>
<p>In Lovelock's 2006 book, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Revenge_of_Gaia" title="The Revenge of Gaia">The Revenge of Gaia</a></i>, he argues that the lack of respect humans have had for Gaia, through the damage done to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rainforests" title="Rainforests">rainforests</a> and the reduction in planetary biodiversity, is testing Gaia's capacity to minimize the effects of the addition of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a> in the atmosphere. This eliminates the planet's <a href="/wiki/Negative_feedback" title="Negative feedback">negative feedbacks</a> and increases the likelihood of <a href="/wiki/Homeostasis" title="Homeostasis">homeostatic</a> <a href="/wiki/Positive_feedback" title="Positive feedback">positive feedback</a> potential associated with runaway <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. Similarly the warming of the oceans is extending the oceanic <a href="/wiki/Thermocline" title="Thermocline">thermocline</a> layer of tropical oceans into the Arctic and Antarctic waters, preventing the rise of oceanic nutrients into the surface waters and eliminating the <a href="/wiki/Algal_bloom" title="Algal bloom">algal blooms</a> of <a href="/wiki/Phytoplankton" title="Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> on which oceanic <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chains</a> depend. As phytoplankton and forests are the main ways in which Gaia draws down greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, taking it out of the atmosphere, the elimination of this environmental buffering will see, according to Lovelock, most of the earth becoming uninhabitable for humans and other life-forms by the middle of this century, with a massive extension of tropical deserts. (In 2012, Lovelock distanced himself from these conclusions, saying he had "gone too far" in describing the consequences of climate change over the next century in this book.)</p>
<p>In his 2009 book, "<i>The Vanishing Face of Gaia</i>", he rejects scientific modelling that disagrees with the scientific findings that sea levels are rising faster, and Arctic ice is melting faster, than the models predict and he suggests that we may already be beyond the tipping point of terrestrial climate resilience into a permanently hot state. Given these conditions, Lovelock expects human civilization will be hard pressed to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/End_of_civilization" title="End of civilization">survive</a>. He expects the change to be similar to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum" title="Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a> when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_carbon_dioxide" title="Atmospheric carbon dioxide">atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub></a> was 450 ppm. At that point the Arctic Ocean was 23 °C and had crocodiles in it, with the rest of the world mostly scrub and desert.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nuclear_power">Nuclear power</span></h3>
<p>Lovelock has become concerned about the threat of global warming from the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a>. In 2004 he caused a media sensation when he broke with many fellow environmentalists by pronouncing that "only nuclear power can now halt global warming". In his view, nuclear energy is the only realistic alternative to fossil fuels that has the capacity to both fulfill the large scale energy needs of humankind while also reducing greenhouse emissions. He is an open member of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmentalists_for_Nuclear_Energy" title="Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy">Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, against the backdrop of renewed UK government interest in nuclear power, Lovelock again publicly announced his support for nuclear energy, stating, "I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy". Although these interventions in the public debate on nuclear power are recent, his views on it are longstanding. In his 1988 book <i>The Ages of Gaia</i> he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have never regarded <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_radiation" title="Nuclear radiation">nuclear radiation</a> or nuclear power as anything other than a normal and inevitable part of the environment. Our <a href="/wiki/Prokaryote" title="Prokaryote">prokaryotic</a> forebears evolved on a planet-sized lump of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fallout" title="Nuclear fallout">fallout</a> from a star-sized nuclear explosion, a <a href="/wiki/Supernova" title="Supernova">supernova</a> that <a href="/wiki/Nucleosynthesis" title="Nucleosynthesis">synthesised</a> the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">elements</a> that go to make our planet and ourselves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Revenge_of_Gaia" title="The Revenge of Gaia">The Revenge of Gaia</a></i> (2006), where he puts forward the concept of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_retreat" title="Sustainable retreat">sustainable retreat</a>, Lovelock writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A television interviewer once asked me, 'But what about nuclear waste? Will it not poison the whole biosphere and persist for millions of years?' I knew this to be a nightmare fantasy wholly without substance in the real world... One of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife. This is true of the land around <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl</a>, the bomb test sites of the Pacific, and areas near the United States' <a href="/wiki/Savannah_River" title="Savannah River">Savannah River</a> nuclear weapons plant of the Second World War. Wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous, and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets... I find it sad, but all too human, that there are vast bureaucracies concerned about nuclear waste, huge organisations devoted to decommissioning power stations, but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste, carbon dioxide."</p>

<p>Writing in the British newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> in January 2006, Lovelock argued that, as a result of global warming, "billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable" by the end of the 21st century. He has been quoted in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> that 80% of humans will perish by 2100 AD, and this climate change will last 100,000 years. According to James Lovelock, by 2040, the world population of more than six billion will have been culled by floods, drought and famine. Indeed, "[t]he people of Southern Europe, as well as South-East Asia, will be fighting their way into countries such as Canada, Australia and Britain".</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"By 2040, parts of the Sahara desert will have moved into middle Europe. We are talking about Paris – as far north as Berlin. In Britain we will escape because of our oceanic position."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He further predicted, the average temperature in temperate regions would increase by as much as 8 °C and by up to 5 °C in the tropics, leaving much of the world's land uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming, with northerly migrations and new cities created in the Arctic. He predicted much of Europe will have become uninhabitable having turned to desert and Britain will have become Europe's "life-raft" due to its stable temperature caused by being surrounded by the ocean. He suggested that "we have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act, and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation for as long as they can".</p>
<p>He partly retreated from this position in a September 2007 address to the <a href="/wiki/World_Nuclear_Association" title="World Nuclear Association">World Nuclear Association</a>'s Annual Symposium, suggesting that climate change would stabilise and prove survivable, and that the Earth itself is in "no danger" because it would stabilise in a new state. Life, however, might be forced to migrate <i>en masse</i> to remain in habitable climes. In 2009, he became a patron of <a href="/wiki/Population_Matters" title="Population Matters">Population Matters</a> (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust), which campaigns for a gradual decline in the global human population to a sustainable level.</p>
<p>In a March 2010 interview with <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper, he said that democracy might have to be "put on hold" to prevent climate change. He continued:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"Even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must be put on hold for the time being. I have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Statements from 2012 portray Lovelock as continuing his concern over global warming while at the same time criticizing extremism and suggesting alternatives to oil, coal and the green solutions he does not support.</p>
<p>In an April 2012 interview, aired on <a href="/wiki/MSNBC" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a>, Lovelock stated that he had been "alarmist", using the words “All right, I made a mistake,” about the timing of climate change and noted the documentary <i><a href="/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth" title="An Inconvenient Truth">An Inconvenient Truth</a></i> and the book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Weather_Makers" title="The Weather Makers">The Weather Makers</a></i> as examples of the same kind of alarmism. Lovelock still believes the climate to be warming although the rate of change is not as he once thought, he admitted that he had been “extrapolating too far." He believes that climate change is still happening, but it will be felt farther in the future. Of the claims “the science is settled” on global warming he states:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"One thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don’t know it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He criticizes environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>“It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion,” Lovelock observed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>“I don’t think people have noticed that, but it’s got all the sort of terms that religions use … The greens use guilt. That just shows how religious greens are. You can’t win people round by saying they are guilty for putting (carbon dioxide) in the air.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the MSNBC article Lovelock is quoted as proclaiming:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"The problem is we don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn’t happened;" he continues</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"The climate is doing its usual tricks. There’s nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now," he said</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The world has not warmed up very much since the millennium. Twelve years is a reasonable time ... it (the temperature) has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising - carbon dioxide is rising, no question about that", he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow up interview Lovelock stated his support for <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>; he now favors <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fracking" title="Fracking">fracking</a> as a low-polluting alternative to coal. He opposes the concept of "sustainable development", where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines, calling it meaningless drivel. He keeps a poster of a <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbine</a> to remind himself how much he detests them.</p>

<p>In September 2007, Lovelock and <a href="/wiki/Chris_Rapley" title="Chris Rapley">Chris Rapley</a> proposed the construction of ocean pumps to pump water up from below the <a href="/wiki/Thermocline" title="Thermocline">thermocline</a> to "fertilize algae in the surface waters and encourage them to bloom".

A scheme similar to that proposed by Lovelock and Rapley is already being independently developed by a commercial company.</p>
<p>The proposal attracted widespread <a href="/wiki/Media_(communication)" title="Media (communication)">media</a> attention and criticism. Commenting on the proposal, <a href="/wiki/Corinne_Le_Qu%C3%A9r%C3%A9" title="Corinne Le Quéré">Corinne Le Quéré</a>, a <a href="/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia" title="University of East Anglia">University of East Anglia</a> researcher, said "It doesn’t make sense. There is absolutely no evidence that <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a> options work or even go in the right direction. I’m astonished that they published this. Before any geoengineering is put to work a massive amount of research is needed – research which will take 20 to 30 years". Other researchers have claimed that "this scheme would bring water with high natural <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> levels (associated with the nutrients) back to the surface, potentially causing exhalation of CO<sub>2</sub>". Lovelock subsequently said that his proposal was intended to stimulate interest and research would be the next step.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainable_retreat">Sustainable retreat</span></h4>
<p>Sustainable retreat is a concept developed by James Lovelock in order to define the necessary changes to human settlement and dwelling at the global scale with the purpose of adapting to global warming and preventing its expected negative consequences on humans.</p>
<p>Lovelock thinks the time is past for <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>, and that we have come to a time when development is no longer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable" title="Sustainable">sustainable</a>. Therefore, we need to retreat. Lovelock states the following in order to explain the concept:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Retreat, in his view, means it's time to start talking about changing where we live and how we get our food; about making plans for the migration of millions of people from low-lying regions like <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> into Europe; about admitting that <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> is a goner and moving the people to cities better positioned for the future. Most of all, he says, it's about everybody "absolutely doing their utmost to sustain civilization, so that it doesn't degenerate into Dark Ages, with warlords running things, which is a real danger. We could lose everything that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of sustainable retreat emphasized a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs with lower levels and/or less environmentally harmful types of resources.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Awards_and_honours">Awards and honours</span></h2>
<p>Lovelock was elected a Fellow of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> in 1974. His nomination reads:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Lovelock has made distinguished contributions to several diverse fields, including a study of the transmission of <a href="/wiki/Respiratory_system" title="Respiratory system">respiratory</a> infection, and methods of air <a href="/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)" title="Sterilization (microbiology)">sterilisation</a>; the role of <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">Ca</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Divalent" title="Divalent">divalent</a> <a href="/wiki/Ion" title="Ion">ions</a> in <a href="/wiki/Coagulation" title="Coagulation">blood clotting</a>; damage to various living cells by freezing, thawing and <a href="/wiki/Thermal_shock" title="Thermal shock">thermal shock</a> and its prevention by the presence of neutral <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solute" title="Solute">solutes</a>; methods of freezing and thawing small live animals; methods for preparing sperm for <a href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination" title="Artificial insemination">artificial insemination</a>, which have been of major economic importance.</p>
