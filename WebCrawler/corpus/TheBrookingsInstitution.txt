<p>The <b>Brookings Institution</b> is a century-old American research group on <a href="/wiki/Think_Tank_Row_(Washington_DC)" title="Think Tank Row (Washington DC)">Think Tank Row</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> It conducts research and education in the social sciences, primarily in economics, metropolitan policy, governance, foreign policy, and global economy and development. Its stated mission is to "provide innovative and practical recommendations that advance three broad goals: strengthen American democracy; foster the economic and social welfare, security and opportunity of all Americans; and secure a more open, safe, prosperous, and cooperative international system."</p>
<p>Brookings has five research programs at its Washington, D.C. campus (Economic Studies, Foreign Policy, Governance Studies, Global Economy and Development, and Metropolitan Policy) and three international centers based in Doha, Qatar (<a href="/wiki/Brookings_Doha_Center" title="Brookings Doha Center">Brookings Doha Center</a>), Beijing, China (Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy), and New Delhi, India (Brookings India).</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>'s <i>2015 Global Go To Think Tanks Report</i>, Brookings was named "Think Tank of the Year," "Best Think Tank in the World," and "Best Think Tank in the U.S.A." for the ninth consecutive year, dating back to the inaugural index of 2006. In the same report, Brookings was also named best think tank for "Domestic Economic Policy" and "International Development," in addition to being "Best Managed," having "Best Quality Assurance and Integrity Policies," and having the "Most Significant Impact on Public Policy."</p>
<p>Brookings states that its staff "represent diverse points of view" and describes itself as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-partisan" title="Non-partisan">non-partisan</a>, while the media sometimes describes Brookings as "liberal". An academic analysis of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referenced by conservative politicians almost as frequently as liberal politicians, earning a score of 53 on a 1–100 scale with 100 representing the most liberal score. The same study found Brookings to be the most frequently cited think tank by the U.S. media and politicians.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1916.E2.80.931979">1916–1979</span></h3>

<p>Brookings was founded in 1916 as the Institute for Government Research (IGR), with the mission of becoming "the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level".</p>
<p>The Institution's founder, philanthropist <a href="/wiki/Robert_S._Brookings" title="Robert S. Brookings">Robert S. Brookings</a> (1850–1932), originally financed the formation of three organizations: the Institute for Government Research, the Institute of Economics, and the Robert Brookings Graduate School affiliated with <a href="/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis" title="Washington University in St. Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. The three were merged into the Brookings Institution on December 8, 1927.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> economists at Brookings embarked on a large scale study commissioned by President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to understand the underlying causes of the depression. Brookings's first president <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Harold_Moulton&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Harold Moulton (page does not exist)">Harold Moulton</a> and other Brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose President Roosevelt's <a href="/wiki/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> policies because they thought such measures were impeding economic recovery. With the entry into World War II in 1941, Brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization.</p>
<p>In 1948, Brookings was asked to submit a plan for the administration of the European Recovery Program. The resulting organization scheme assured that the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Plan" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> was run carefully and on a businesslike basis.</p>
<p>In 1952, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Robert_Calkins&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert Calkins (page does not exist)">Robert Calkins</a> succeeded Moulton as president of the Brookings Institution. He secured grants from the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation" title="Rockefeller Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Foundation" title="Ford Foundation">Ford Foundation</a> that put the Institution on a strong financial basis. He reorganized the Institution around the Economic Studies, Government Studies, and Foreign Policy Programs. In 1957, the Institution moved from Jackson Avenue to a new research center near <a href="/wiki/Dupont_Circle" title="Dupont Circle">Dupont Circle</a> in Washington, DC.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Kermit_Gordon" title="Kermit Gordon">Kermit Gordon</a> assumed the presidency of Brookings in 1967. He began a series of studies of program choices for the federal budget in 1969 entitled "Setting National Priorities". He also expanded the Foreign Policy Studies Program to include research in national security and defense. After the election of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> to the presidency in 1968, the relationship between the Brookings Institution and the White House deteriorated; at one point Nixon's aide <a href="/wiki/Charles_Colson" title="Charles Colson">Charles Colson</a> proposed a firebombing of the Institution. Yet throughout the 1970s, Brookings was offered more federal research contracts than it could handle.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1980.E2.80.932015">1980–2015</span></h3>



<p>By the 1980s, the Institution faced an increasingly competitive and ideologically charged intellectual environment. The need to reduce the federal budget <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government_budget_deficit" title="Government budget deficit">deficit</a> became a major research theme as well as investigating problems with national security and government inefficiency. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Bruce_MacLaury&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Bruce MacLaury (page does not exist)">Bruce MacLaury</a>, fourth president of Brookings, also established the Center for Public Policy Education to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs.</p>
<p>In 1995, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Armacost" title="Michael Armacost">Michael Armacost</a> became the fifth president of the Brookings Institution and led an effort to refocus the Institution's mission heading into the 21st Century. Under Armacost's direction, Brookings created several interdisciplinary research centers such as the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy (now the Metropolitan Policy Program, led by <a href="/wiki/Bruce_J._Katz" title="Bruce J. Katz">Bruce J. Katz</a>), brought attention to the strengths of cities and metropolitan areas, and the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, which brings together specialists from different Asian countries to examine regional problems.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Strobe_Talbott" title="Strobe Talbott">Strobe Talbott</a> became president of Brookings in 2002. Shortly thereafter, Brookings launched the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saban_Center_for_Middle_East_Policy" title="Saban Center for Middle East Policy">Saban Center for Middle East Policy</a> and the John L. Thornton China Center. In October 2006, Brookings announced the establishment of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. In July 2007, the Institution announced the creation of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform to be directed by senior fellow <a href="/wiki/Mark_McClellan" title="Mark McClellan">Mark McClellan</a>, and then in October 2007, the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Brookings_Doha_Center" title="Brookings Doha Center">Brookings Doha Center</a> directed by fellow <a href="/wiki/Hady_Amr" title="Hady Amr">Hady Amr</a> in Qatar.</p>
<p>In 2015, Brookings found itself at the center of controversy over the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fiduciary_obligation" title="Fiduciary obligation">fiduciary obligation</a> of brokers to savers. A nonresident senior fellow, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Robert_Litan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert Litan (page does not exist)">Robert Litan</a>, presented a study to Congress in July 2015 that contained a cost/benefit analysis regarding a new agency rule. He resigned that position as a result of a firestorm, months later in September 2015, kicked up by Senator <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren" title="Elizabeth Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> charging Litan—who had testified against a fiduciary obligation rule. Mr. Litan was unaware of the brand new rule when he presented, and settled with the Brookings Institute immediately after the presentation when they brought it to his attention. Litan's defenders continue to point out that he did disclose, and that Warren's real motive was to silence a reasonable concern over the cost/benefit balance.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Publications">Publications</span></h2>
<p>Brookings as an institution produces an Annual Report.

In a 1997 survey of congressional staff and journalists, Brookings ranked as the second-most influential and first in credibility among 27 think tanks. Moreover, “Brookings and its researchers are not so concerned, in their work, in affecting the ideological direction of the nation” and rather tend “to be staffed by researchers with strong academic credentials”.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Foreign_funding">Foreign funding</span></h3>
<p>An investigation by <i>The New York Times</i>, reported on September 6, 2014, found the Brookings Institution to be among more than a dozen Washington research groups to have received tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments in recent years, while producing policy papers, hosting forums, and organizing private briefings with U.S. officials to encourage support for policies aligned with those foreign governments' agenda.</p>
<p><i>The New York Times</i> published documents showing that Brookings Institution accepted grants from Norway with specific policy requests and helped the country gain access to U.S. government officials, as well as other "deliverables". In June 2014, Norway agreed to make an additional $4 million donation to Brookings. Several legal specialists, who examined the documents between the Norway government and Brookings at <i>The Times'</i> request, told the paper that the language of the transactions "appeared to necessitate Brookings filing as a foreign agent" under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foreign_Agent_Registration_Act" title="Foreign Agent Registration Act">Foreign Agent Registration Act</a>.</p>
<p>The Qatari government was named by <i>The New York Times</i> as "the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings", having reportedly made a $14.8 million, four-year contribution in 2013. A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said "he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers". Brookings officials denied any connection between the views of their funders and their scholars' work, citing reports that questioned the Qatari government's education reform efforts and criticized its support of militants in Syria. However, Brookings officials also reportedly acknowledged that they meet with Qatari government officials regularly to discuss the center's activities and budget, and that the former prime minister of Qatar currently serves on the center's advisory board.</p>
