<p>Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames "the Strong", "the Saxon Hercules" and "Iron-Hand." He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking <a href="/wiki/Horseshoe" title="Horseshoe">horseshoes</a> with his bare hands and engaging in <a href="/wiki/Fox_tossing" title="Fox tossing">fox tossing</a> by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end.</p>
<p>In order to be elected King of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism.

<p>As Elector of <a href="/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony" title="Electorate of Saxony">Saxony</a>, he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He established the Saxon capital of <a href="/wiki/Dresden" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> as a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw.</p>
<p>His reigns brought Poland some troubled times. He led the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern_War" title="Great Northern War">Great Northern War</a>, which led to the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> strengthening its influence in Europe, especially within Poland. His main pursuit was bolstering royal power in the Commonwealth, characterized by broad decentralization in comparison with other European monarchies. He tried to accomplish this goal using foreign powers and thus destabilized the state.</p>

<p>Augustus was born in Dresden on 12 May 1670, the younger son of the Elector <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_George_III_of_Saxony" title="John George III of Saxony">Johann Georg III</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anne_Sophie_of_Denmark" title="Anne Sophie of Denmark">Anne Sophie of Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>As the second son, Augustus had no expectation of inheriting the electorate, since his older brother, <a href="/wiki/John_George_IV,_Elector_of_Saxony" title="John George IV, Elector of Saxony">Johann Georg IV</a>, assumed the post after the death of their father on 12 September 1691.</p>
<p>Augustus married <a href="/wiki/Christiane_Eberhardine_of_Brandenburg-Bayreuth" title="Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Kristiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bayreuth" title="Bayreuth">Bayreuth</a> on 20 January 1693. They had a son, <a href="/wiki/Augustus_III_of_Poland" title="Augustus III of Poland">Frederick Augustus II</a> (1696–1763), who succeeded his father as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elector_of_Saxony" title="Elector of Saxony">Elector of Saxony</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/King_of_Poland" title="King of Poland">King of Poland</a> as Augustus III.</p>
<p>While cavorting during the carnival season in Venice, his older brother, the Elector Johann Georg IV, contracted <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> from his mistress Magdalene Sybille of Neidschutz. On 27 April 1694, Johann Georg died without legitimate issue and Augustus became <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elector_of_Saxony" title="Elector of Saxony">Elector of Saxony</a>, as Friedrich Augustus I.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conversion_to_Catholicism">Conversion to Catholicism</span></h2>
<p>To be eligible for election to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1697, Augustus had to convert to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Saxony" title="Duchy of Saxony">Saxon</a> dukes had traditionally been called "champions of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a>." Saxony had been a stronghold of German <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> and Augustus' conversion was therefore considered shocking in Protestant <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Although the prince-elector guaranteed Saxony's religious status quo, Augustus' conversion alienated many of his Protestant subjects. As a result of the enormous expenditure of money used to bribe the Polish nobility and clergy, Augustus' contemporaries derisively referred to the Saxon duke's royal ambitions as his "Polish adventure."</p>
<p>His church policy within the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> followed orthodox <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> and ran counter to his new-found religious and absolutist convictions. The Protestant princes of the empire and the two remaining Protestant electors (of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electorate_of_Hanover" title="Electorate of Hanover">Hanover</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Electorate_of_Prussia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Electorate of Prussia (page does not exist)">Prussia</a>) were anxious to keep Saxony well-integrated in their camp. According to the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Augsburg" title="Peace of Augsburg">Peace of Augsburg</a>, Augustus theoretically had the right to re-introduce Roman Catholicism (see <i><a href="/wiki/Cuius_regio,_eius_religio" title="Cuius regio, eius religio">Cuius regio, eius religio</a></i>), or at least grant full religious freedom to his fellow Catholics in Saxony, but this never happened. Saxony remained Lutheran and the few Roman Catholics residing in Saxony lacked any political or civil rights. In 1717, it became clear just how awkward the situation was: to realize his ambitious dynastic plans in Poland and Germany, it was necessary for Augustus' heirs to become Roman Catholic. After five years as a convert, his son—the future Augustus III—publicly avowed his Roman Catholicism. The Saxon Estates were outraged and revolted. It was becoming clearer that the conversion to Roman Catholicism was not only a matter of form, but of substance as well.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia" title="Peace of Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a>, the Elector of Saxony had been the director of the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Diet_(Holy_Roman_Empire)#Religious_bodies" title="Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)">Protestant body in the Reichstag</a>. To placate the other Protestant states in the Empire, Augustus nominally delegated the directorship of the Protestant body to <a href="/wiki/Johann_Adolf_II,_Duke_of_Saxe-Weissenfels" title="Johann Adolf II, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels">Johann Adolf II</a>, Duke of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Saxe-Weissenfels" title="Duchy of Saxe-Weissenfels">Saxe-Weissenfels</a>. However, when <a href="/wiki/Augustus_III_of_Poland" title="Augustus III of Poland">the Elector's son</a> also converted to Catholicism, the Electorate faced a hereditary Catholic succession instead of a return to a Protestant Elector upon Augustus's death. When the conversion became public in 1717, <a href="/wiki/Brandenburg-Prussia" title="Brandenburg-Prussia">Brandenburg-Prussia</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electorate_of_Brunswick-Luneburg" title="Electorate of Brunswick-Luneburg">Hanover</a> attempted to oust Saxony from the directorship and appoint themselves as joint directors, but they gave up the attempt in 1720. Saxony would retain the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, despite the fact that all remaining Electors of Saxony were Catholic.</p>
<p>The wife of Augustus I, the Electress Christiane Eberhardine, refused to follow her husband's example and remained a staunch Protestant. She did not attend her husband's coronation in Poland and led a rather quiet life outside Dresden, gaining some popularity for her stubbornness.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="King_of_Poland_for_the_first_time">King of Poland for the first time</span></h2>

<p>Following the death of Polish King <a href="/wiki/John_III_Sobieski" title="John III Sobieski">John III Sobieski</a> and having converted to Catholicism, Augustus was elected King of the <a href="/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in 1697 with the backing of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, which financed him through the banker, <a href="/wiki/Issachar_Berend_Lehmann" title="Issachar Berend Lehmann">Berend Lehmann</a>. At the time, some questioned the legality of Augustus' elevation, since another candidate, <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Louis,_Prince_of_Conti" title="François Louis, Prince of Conti">François Louis</a>, Prince of <a href="/wiki/Conty" title="Conty">Conti</a>, had received more votes. Both candidates, Conti and Augustus, were proclaimed as king by different ecclesiastical authorities (by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primate_of_Poland" title="Primate of Poland">Primate</a> Michaŀ Radziejowski and bishop of Kujawy, Stanisław Dąmbski, respectively, with <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Heinrich_von_Flemming" title="Jacob Heinrich von Flemming">Jacob Heinrich von Flemming</a> swearing to the <i><a href="/wiki/Pacta_conventa" title="Pacta conventa">pacta conventa</a></i> in Augustus's place). However, Augustus hurried to the Commonwealth with a Saxon army, while Conti stayed in France for two months.</p>
<p>Augustus continued the war of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_League_(1684)" title="Holy League (1684)">Holy League</a> against Turkey, and after a campaign in Moldavia, his Polish army eventually defeated the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tatar" title="Tatar">Tatar</a> expedition in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Podhajce_(1698)" title="Battle of Podhajce (1698)">Battle of Podhajce</a> in 1698. This victory compelled the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> to sign the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Karlowitz" title="Treaty of Karlowitz">Treaty of Karlowitz</a> in 1699. <a href="/wiki/Podolia" title="Podolia">Podolia</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kamieniec_Podolski" title="Kamieniec Podolski">Kamieniec Podolski</a> returned to Poland. An ambitious ruler, Augustus hoped to make the Polish throne hereditary within his family, and to use his resources as Elector of <a href="/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony" title="Electorate of Saxony">Saxony</a> to impose some order on the chaotic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was, however, soon distracted from his internal reform projects by the possibility of external conquest. He formed an alliance with Denmark's <a href="/wiki/Frederick_IV_of_Denmark" title="Frederick IV of Denmark">Frederick IV</a> and Russia's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peter_I_of_Russia" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter I</a> to strip Sweden's young King <a href="/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden" title="Charles XII of Sweden">Charles XII</a> (who was Augustus' cousin) of his possessions. Poland's reward for participation in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern_War" title="Great Northern War">Great Northern War</a> was to have been the Swedish territory of <a href="/wiki/Livonia" title="Livonia">Livonia</a>. Charles proved an able military commander, however, quickly forcing the Danes out of the war and then driving back the Russians at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Narva_(1700)" title="Battle of Narva (1700)">Narva</a>, thereby allowing him to focus on the struggle with Augustus. However, this war ultimately proved as disastrous for Sweden as for Poland.</p>
<p>Charles defeated Augustus' army at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Daugava" title="Crossing of the Daugava">Riga</a> in July 1701, forcing the Polish-Saxon army to withdraw from Livonia, and followed this up with an invasion of Poland. He captured <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> on 14 May 1702, defeated the Polish-Saxon army again at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Klisz%C3%B3w" title="Battle of Kliszów">Battle of Kliszów</a>, and took <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>. He defeated another of Augustus' armies under the command of <a href="/wiki/Generalfeldmarschall" title="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a> <a href="/wiki/Adam_Heinrich_von_Steinau" title="Adam Heinrich von Steinau">Adam Heinrich von Steinau</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pu%C5%82tusk_(1703)" title="Battle of Pułtusk (1703)">Battle of Pułtusk</a> in spring 1703, and besieged and captured Thorn (<a href="/wiki/Toru%C5%84" title="Toruń">Toruń</a>).</p>
<p>By this time, Augustus was certainly ready for peace, but Charles felt that he would be more secure if he could establish someone with whom he had more influence on the Polish throne. In 1704 the Swedes installed <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Leszczy%C5%84ski" title="Stanisław Leszczyński">Stanisław Leszczyński</a> and <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Warsaw_(1705)" title="Treaty of Warsaw (1705)">tied the commonwealth to Sweden</a>, which compelled Augustus to initiate military operations in Poland alongside Russia (<a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Narva" title="Treaty of Narva">an alliance was concluded</a> in <a href="/wiki/Narva" title="Narva">Narva</a> in summer 1704). The resulting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civil_war_in_Poland_(1704-1706)" title="Civil war in Poland (1704-1706)">civil war in Poland (1704-1706)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Campaign_of_Grodno" title="Campaign of Grodno">Grodno campaign</a> did not go well for August. Following the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fraustadt" title="Battle of Fraustadt">Battle of Fraustadt</a>, on 1 September 1706, Charles invaded <a href="/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony" title="Electorate of Saxony">Saxony</a>, forcing Augustus to yield the Polish throne to Leszczyński by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Altranst%C3%A4dt_(1706)" title="Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)">Treaty of Altranstädt</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia's Tsar <a href="/wiki/Peter_the_Great" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a> had reformed his army, and dealt a crippling defeat to the Swedes at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Poltava" title="Battle of Poltava">Battle of Poltava</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="King_of_Poland_for_the_second_time">King of Poland for the second time</span></h2>


<p>The weakened <a href="/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> soon came to be regarded as almost a <a href="/wiki/Protectorate" title="Protectorate">protectorate</a> of Russia. In 1709 Augustus II <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Thorn_(1709)" title="Treaty of Thorn (1709)">returned to the Polish throne under Russian auspices</a>. Once again he attempted to establish an <a href="/wiki/Absolute_monarchy" title="Absolute monarchy">absolute monarchy</a> in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but was faced with opposition from the nobility (<i><a href="/wiki/Szlachta" title="Szlachta">szlachta</a></i>, see <a href="/wiki/Tarnogr%C3%B3d_Confederation" title="Tarnogród Confederation">Tarnogród Confederation</a>). Peter the Great seized on this opportunity to pose as mediator, threatened the Commonwealth militarily, and in 1717 forced Augustus and the nobility to sign an accommodation favorable to Russian interests, at the <a href="/wiki/Silent_Sejm" title="Silent Sejm">Silent Sejm</a> (<i>Sejm Niemy</i>).</p>
<p>For the remainder of his reign, in an uneasy relationship, Augustus was more or less dependent on Russia (and to a lesser extent, on Austria) to maintain his throne. He gave up his dynastic ambitions and concentrated instead on attempts to strengthen the Commonwealth. Faced with both internal and foreign opposition, however, he achieved little.</p>
<p>Augustus died at Warsaw in 1733. Although he had failed to make the Polish throne hereditary in his house, his eldest son, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, did succeed him to the Polish throne as <a href="/wiki/Augustus_III_of_Poland" title="Augustus III of Poland">Augustus III of Poland</a>—although he had to be installed by the Russian army in the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Polish_Succession" title="War of the Polish Succession">War of the Polish Succession</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Augustus_II_and_the_arts">Augustus II and the arts</span></h3>

<p>Augustus is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He loved fine arts and architecture, and he had beautiful palaces built in Dresden, a city that became renowned for extraordinary cultural brilliance. He introduced the first public museums, such as the <a href="/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnes_Gew%C3%B6lbe" title="Grünes Gewölbe">Green Vault</a> in 1723, and started systematic collection of paintings that are now on display in the <a href="/wiki/Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie_Alte_Meister" title="Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister">Old Masters Gallery</a>.</p>
<p>From 1687 to 1689, Augustus toured France and Italy. The extravagant court in <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles" title="Palace of Versailles">Versailles</a>—perfectly tailored to fit the needs of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_monarch" title="Absolute monarch">absolute monarch</a>—impressed him deeply. In accordance with the spirit of the <a href="/wiki/Baroque" title="Baroque">baroque</a> age, Augustus invested heavily in the representative splendor of <a href="/wiki/Dresden_Castle" title="Dresden Castle">Dresden Castle</a>, his major residence, to advertise his wealth and power.</p>
<p>With strict building regulations, major urban development plans, and a certain feeling for art, the king began to transform Dresden into a renowned cultural center with one of Germany's finest art collections, though most of the city's famous sights and landmarks were completed during the reign of his son Augustus III. The most famous building started under Augustus the Strong was the <a href="/wiki/Zwinger_(Dresden)" title="Zwinger (Dresden)">Zwinger</a>. Also known are <a href="/wiki/Pillnitz_Castle" title="Pillnitz Castle">Pillnitz Castle</a>, his summer residence, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Schloss_Moritzburg" title="Schloss Moritzburg">Moritzburg Castle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hubertusburg" title="Hubertusburg">Hubertusburg</a> Castle, his hunting lodges.</p>
<p>A man of pleasure, the king sponsored lavish court balls, Venetian-style <i>balli in maschera</i>, and luxurious court gatherings, games, and garden festivities. His court acquired a reputation for extravagance throughout Europe. He held a famous <a href="/wiki/Fox_tossing" title="Fox tossing">animal-tossing</a> contest in <a href="/wiki/Dresden" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> at which 647 foxes, 533 <a href="/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hares</a>, 34 <a href="/wiki/Badger" title="Badger">badgers</a> and 21 <a href="/wiki/Wildcat" title="Wildcat">wildcats</a> were tossed and killed. Augustus himself participated, reportedly demonstrating his strength by holding the end of his sling by just one finger, with two of the strongest men in his court on the other end.</p>

<p>Augustus II successfully sponsored efforts to discover the secret of manufacturing porcelain. In 1701 he rescued the young alchemist <a href="/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_B%C3%B6ttger" title="Johann Friedrich Böttger">Johann Friedrich Böttger</a>, who had fled from the court of the king of Prussia, <a href="/wiki/Frederick_I_of_Prussia" title="Frederick I of Prussia">Frederick I</a>, who had expected that he produce gold for him as he had boasted he could.</p>
<p>Augustus imprisoned Böttger and tried to force him to reveal the secret of manufacturing gold. Böttger's transition from alchemist to potter was orchestrated as an attempt to avoid the impossible demands of the king. Being an alchemist by profession rather than a potter, gave Böttger an advantage. He realised that the current approaches, which involved mixing fine white substances like crushed egg shells into clay, would not work. Rather, his approach was to attempt to bake clay at higher temperatures than had ever before been attained in European kilns. That approach yielded the breakthrough that had eluded European potters for a century. The manufacture of fine porcelain continues at the <a href="/wiki/Meissen_porcelain" title="Meissen porcelain">Meissen porcelain</a> factory.</p>
