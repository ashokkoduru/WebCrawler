<p>The <b>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</b> (<b>IPCC</b>) is a scientific and <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization" title="Intergovernmental organization">intergovernmental body</a> under the auspices of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, set up at the request of member governments, dedicated to the task of providing the world with an objective, scientific view of climate change and its political and economic impacts. It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO) and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP), and later endorsed by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> through Resolution 43/53. Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP. The IPCC produces reports that support the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty on climate change. The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system". IPCC reports cover "the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">its potential impacts</a> and options for <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation" title="Climate change adaptation">adaptation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">mitigation</a>."</p>
<p>The IPCC does not carry out its own original research, nor does it do the work of monitoring climate or related phenomena itself. The IPCC <a href="/wiki/Systematic_review" title="Systematic review">bases its assessment on the published literature</a>, which includes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peer-review" title="Peer-review">peer-reviewed</a> and non-peer-reviewed sources.</p>
<p>Thousands of scientists and other experts contribute (on a voluntary basis, without payment from the IPCC) to writing and reviewing reports, which are then reviewed by governments. IPCC reports contain a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Summary_for_Policymakers" title="Summary for Policymakers">Summary for Policymakers</a>", which is subject to line-by-line approval by delegates from all participating governments. Typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries.</p>
<p>The IPCC provides an internationally accepted authority on climate change, producing reports which have the agreement of leading climate scientists and the consensus of participating governments. The <a href="/wiki/2007_Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="2007 Nobel Peace Prize">2007</a> <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> was shared, in equal parts, between the IPCC and <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins_and_aims">Origins and aims</span></h2>
<p>The IPCC developed from an international scientific body, the <a href="/wiki/Advisory_Group_on_Greenhouse_Gases" title="Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases">Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases</a> set up in 1985 by the <a href="/wiki/International_Council_for_Science" title="International Council for Science">International Council of Scientific Unions</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP), and the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO) to provide recommendations based on current research. This small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of climate science, The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_State_Department" title="United States State Department">State Department</a> wanted an international convention to agree restrictions on <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a>, and the conservative <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan" title="Presidency of Ronald Reagan">Reagan Administration</a> was concerned about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from United Nations bodies including UNEP and the WMO. The U.S. government was the main force in forming the IPCC as an autonomous intergovernmental body in which scientists took part both as experts on the science and as official representatives of their governments, to produce reports which had the firm backing of all the leading scientists worldwide researching the topic, and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every one of the participating governments. In this way, it was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organisation.</p>
<p>The principles that the IPCC operates under are set out in the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions, as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process.</p>
<p>The aims of the IPCC are to assess scientific information relevant to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human-induced climate change,</li>
<li>The impacts of human-induced climate change,</li>
<li>Options for adaptation and mitigation.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>
<p>Korean economist <a href="/wiki/Hoesung_Lee" title="Hoesung Lee">Hoesung Lee</a> is the chair of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the election of the new IPCC Bureau. Before this election, the IPCC was led by his vice-Chair <a href="/wiki/Ismail_El_Gizouli" title="Ismail El Gizouli">Ismail El Gizouli</a>, who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of <a href="/wiki/Rajendra_K._Pachauri" title="Rajendra K. Pachauri">Rajendra K. Pachauri</a> in February 2015. The previous chairs were <a href="/wiki/Rajendra_K._Pachauri" title="Rajendra K. Pachauri">Rajendra K. Pachauri</a>, elected in May 2002; <a href="/wiki/Robert_Watson_(scientist)" title="Robert Watson (scientist)">Robert Watson</a> in 1997; and <a href="/wiki/Bert_Bolin" title="Bert Bolin">Bert Bolin</a> in 1988. The chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs, working group co-chairs, and a secretariat.</p>
<p>The IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations. Participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged. Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC <a href="/wiki/Working_group" title="Working group">Working groups</a> are held at the level of government representatives. Non Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers. Sessions of the IPCC Bureau, workshops, expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only. Attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts. After the opening ceremonies, closed plenary sessions were held. The meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at Sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations.</p>
<p>There are several major groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPCC Panel: Meets in plenary session about once a year and controls the organization's structure, procedures, and work program. The Panel is the IPCC corporate entity.</li>
<li>Chair: Elected by the Panel.</li>
<li>Secretariat: Oversees and manages all activities. Supported by UNEP and WMO.</li>
<li>Bureau: Elected by the Panel. Chaired by the Chair. 30 members include IPCC Vice-Chairs, Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs of Working Groups and Task Force.</li>
<li>Working Groups: Each has two Co-Chairs, one from the developed and one from developing world, and a technical support unit.
<ul>
<li>Working Group I: Assesses scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. Co-Chairs: Valérie Masson-Delmotte and Panmao Zhai</li>
<li>Working Group II: Assesses vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, consequences, and adaptation options. Co-Chairs: Hans-Otto Pörtner and Debra Roberts</li>
<li>Working Group III: Assesses options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change. Co-Chairs: Priyadarshi R. Shukla and <a href="/wiki/James_Skea" title="James Skea">Jim Skea</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</li>
</ul>
<p>The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund, established in 1989 by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) and the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO), Costs of the Secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO, while UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary. Annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP, and by IPCC Members; the scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel, which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget. The organisation is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Assessment_reports">Assessment reports</span></h2>

<p>The IPCC has published five comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science, as well as a number of special reports on particular topics. These reports are prepared by teams of relevant researchers selected by the Bureau from government nominations. Drafts of these reports are made available for comment in open review processes to which anyone may contribute.</p>
<p>The IPCC published its <a href="/wiki/IPCC_First_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC First Assessment Report">first assessment report</a> in 1990, a supplementary report in 1992, a <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Second_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Second Assessment Report">second assessment report (SAR)</a> in 1995, a <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Third_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Third Assessment Report">third assessment report (TAR)</a> in 2001, a <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">fourth assessment report (AR4)</a> in 2007 and a <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fifth Assessment Report">fifth assessment report (AR5)</a> in 2014.</p>
<p>Each assessment report is in three volumes, corresponding to Working Groups I, II, and III. Unqualified, "the IPCC report" is often used to mean the Working Group I report, which covers the basic science of climate change.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scope_and_preparation_of_the_reports">Scope and preparation of the reports</span></h3>
<p>The IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data. Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources. According to IPCC guidelines, authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources. Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources (the "grey literature"), provided that they are of sufficient quality. Examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals. Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required.</p>
<p>There are generally three stages in the review process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expert review (6–8 weeks)</li>
<li>Government/expert review</li>
<li>Government review of:
<ul>
<li>Summaries for Policymakers</li>
<li>Overview Chapters</li>
<li>Synthesis Report</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Review comments are in an open archive for at least five years.</p>
<p>There are several types of endorsement which documents receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approval. Material has been subjected to detailed, line by line discussion and agreement.
<ul>
<li>Working Group Summaries for Policymakers are <i>approved</i> by their Working Groups.</li>
<li>Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers is <i>approved</i> by Panel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adoption. Endorsed section by section (and not line by line).
<ul>
<li>Panel <i>adopts</i> Overview Chapters of Methodology Reports.</li>
<li>Panel <i>adopts</i> IPCC Synthesis Report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceptance. Not been subject to line by line discussion and agreement, but presents a comprehensive, objective, and balanced view of the subject matter.
<ul>
<li>Working Groups <i>accept</i> their reports.</li>
<li>Task Force Reports are <i>accepted</i> by the Panel.</li>
<li>Working Group Summaries for Policymakers are <i>accepted</i> by the Panel after group <i>approval</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Panel is responsible for the IPCC and its endorsement of Reports allows it to ensure they meet IPCC standards.</p>
<p>There have been a range of commentaries on the IPCC's procedures, examples of which are discussed later in the article (see also <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Summary_for_Policymakers" title="IPCC Summary for Policymakers">IPCC Summary for Policymakers</a>). Some of these comments have been supportive, while others have been critical. Some commentators have suggested changes to the IPCC's procedures.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Authors">Authors</span></h3>

<p>Each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter typically has two "coordinating lead authors", ten to fifteen "lead authors", and a somewhat larger number of "contributing authors". The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs. Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters. Contributing authors prepare text, graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors.</p>
<p>Authors for the IPCC reports are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments and participating organisations, and by the Working Group/Task Force Bureaux, as well as other experts known through their published work. The choice of authors aims for a range of views, expertise and geographical representation, ensuring representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition.</p>

<p>The IPCC first assessment report was completed in 1990, and served as the basis of the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>The executive summary of the WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a>, resulting on average in an additional warming of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface. They calculate with confidence that CO<sub>2</sub> has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect. They predict that under a "business as usual" (BAU) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °C per decade during the [21st] century. They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability. The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supplementary_report_of_1992">Supplementary report of 1992</span></h3>
<p>The 1992 supplementary report was an update, requested in the context of the negotiations on the UNFCCC at the <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a> (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in 1992.</p>
<p>The major conclusion was that research since 1990 did "not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first IPCC scientific assessment". It noted that transient (time-dependent) simulations, which had been very preliminary in the FAR, were now improved, but did not include aerosol or ozone changes.</p>

<p><i>Climate Change 1995</i>, the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR), was finished in 1996. It is split into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A synthesis to help interpret UNFCCC article 2.</li>
<li><i>The Science of Climate Change</i> (WG I)</li>
<li><i>Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change</i> (WG II)</li>
<li><i>Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change</i> (WG III)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the last three parts was completed by a separate working group, and each has a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) that represents a consensus of national representatives. The SPM of the WG I report contains headings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase</li>
<li>Anthropogenic <a href="/wiki/Aerosol" title="Aerosol">aerosols</a> tend to produce negative radiative forcings</li>
<li>Climate has changed over the past century (air temperature has increased by between 0.3 and 0.6 °C since the late 19th century; this estimate has not significantly changed since the 1990 report).</li>
<li>The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate (considerable progress since the 1990 report in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate, because of: including aerosols; coupled models; pattern-based studies)</li>
<li>Climate is expected to continue to change in the future (increasing realism of simulations increases confidence; important uncertainties remain but are taken into account in the range of model projections)</li>
<li>There are still many uncertainties (estimates of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling; models; instrument data for model testing, assessment of variability, and detection studies)</li>

<p>The Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports, three of them from its working groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working Group I: The Scientific Basis</li>
<li>Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability</li>
<li>Working Group III: Mitigation</li>
<li>Synthesis Report</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of the TAR's conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct, e.g., greater than 66% probability of being correct. These are "<a href="/wiki/Bayesian_probability" title="Bayesian probability">Bayesian</a>" probabilities, which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence.</p>
<p>"Robust findings" of the TAR Synthesis Report include:</p>

Atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic (i.e., human-emitted) <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> have increased substantially.</li>
<li>Since the mid-20th century, most of the observed warming is "likely" (greater than 66% probability, based on expert judgement) due to human activities.</li>
<li>Projections based on the <i><a href="/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios" title="Special Report on Emissions Scenarios">Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</a></i> suggest warming over the 21st century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years.</li>

<p>In 2001, 16 national <a href="/wiki/Academy_of_sciences" title="Academy of sciences">science academies</a> issued a joint statement on climate change. The joint statement was made by the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Academy_of_Science" title="Australian Academy of Science">Australian Academy of Science</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Flemish_Academy_of_Belgium_for_Science_and_the_Arts" title="Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts">Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Brazilian Academy of Sciences">Brazilian Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Canada" title="Royal Society of Canada">Royal Society of Canada</a>, the Caribbean Academy of Sciences, the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a href="/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences" title="French Academy of Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Academy_of_Sciences_Leopoldina" title="German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina">German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Science_Academy" title="Indian National Science Academy">Indian National Science Academy</a>, the Indonesian Academy of Sciences, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy" title="Royal Irish Academy">Royal Irish Academy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Accademia_dei_Lincei" title="Accademia dei Lincei">Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei</a> (Italy), the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society_of_New_Zealand" title="Royal Society of New Zealand">Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> (UK). The statement, also published as an editorial in the journal <a href="/wiki/Science_(journal)" title="Science (journal)">Science</a>, stated "we support the [TAR's] conclusion that it is at least 90% certain that temperatures will continue to rise, with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels by 2100". The TAR has also been endorsed by the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Foundation_for_Climate_and_Atmospheric_Sciences" title="Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences">Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Meteorological_and_Oceanographic_Society" title="Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society">Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society</a>, and <a href="/wiki/European_Geosciences_Union" title="European Geosciences Union">European Geosciences Union</a> (refer to "<a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change#Endorsements_of_the_IPCC" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Endorsements of the IPCC</a>").</p>
<p>In 2001, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_National_Research_Council" title="US National Research Council">US National Research Council</a> (US NRC) produced a report that assessed Working Group I's (WGI) contribution to the TAR. US NRC (2001) "generally agrees" with the WGI assessment, and describes the full WGI report as an "admirable summary of research activities in climate science".</p>
<p>IPCC author <a href="/wiki/Richard_Lindzen" title="Richard Lindzen">Richard Lindzen</a> has made a number of criticisms of the TAR. Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report. For example, Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_climate_model" title="Global climate model">climate models</a>. <a href="/wiki/John_T._Houghton" title="John T. Houghton">John Houghton</a>, who was a co-chair of TAR WGI, has responded to Lindzen's criticisms of the SPM. Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence.</p>
<p>IPCC author <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kevin_Trenberth" title="Kevin Trenberth">Kevin Trenberth</a> has also commented on the WGI SPM. Trenberth has stated that during the drafting of the WGI SPM, some government delegations attempted to "blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report". However, Trenberth concludes that the SPM is a "reasonably balanced summary".</p>
<p>US NRC (2001) concluded that the WGI SPM and Technical Summary are "consistent" with the full WGI report. US NRC (2001) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] the full [WGI] report is adequately summarized in the Technical Summary. The full WGI report and its Technical Summary are not specifically directed at policy. The Summary for Policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change. This change in emphasis appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with policy makers on the document. Written responses from U.S. coordinating and lead scientific authors to the committee indicate, however, that (a) no changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors (this group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors) and (b) most changes that did occur lacked significant impact.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">IPCC Fourth Assessment Report</a></div>
<p>The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) was published in 2007. Like previous assessment reports, it consists of four reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis</li>
<li>Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability</li>
<li>Working Group III: Mitigation</li>
<li>Synthesis Report</li>
</ul>
<p>People from over 130 countries contributed to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, which took 6 years to produce. Contributors to AR4 included more than 2500 scientific expert reviewers, more than 800 contributing authors, and more than 450 lead authors.</p>
<p>"Robust findings" of the Synthesis report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level".</li>
<li>Most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is "very likely" (greater than 90% probability, based on expert judgement) due to human activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Impacts [of climate change] will very likely increase due to increased frequencies and intensities of some extreme weather events".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries even if GHG emissions were to be reduced sufficiently for GHG concentrations to stabilise, due to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks". Stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is discussed in <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">climate change mitigation</a>.</li>
<li>"Some planned adaptation (of human activities) is occurring now; more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability to climate change".</li>
<li>"Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt".</li>
<li>"Many impacts [of climate change] can be reduced, delayed or avoided by mitigation".</li>
</ul>
<p>Global warming projections from AR4 are shown below. The projections apply to the end of the 21st century (2090–99), relative to temperatures at the end of the 20th century (1980–99). Add 0.7 °C to projections to make them relative to pre-industrial levels instead of 1980–99. Descriptions of the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios can be found in <a href="/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios" title="Special Report on Emissions Scenarios">Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</a>.</p>

<p>"Likely" means greater than 66% probability of being correct, based on expert judgement.</p>

These reviews are generally supportive of AR4's conclusions. PBL (2010) make some recommendations to improve the IPCC process. A literature assessment by the US National Research Council (US NRC, 2010) concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for—and in many cases is already affecting—a broad range of human and natural systems</b> [<i>emphasis in original text</i>].

<p>The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was completed in 2014. AR5 followed the same general format as of AR4, with three Working Group reports and a Synthesis report. The Working Group I report (WG1) was published in September 2013.</p>
<p>Conclusions of AR5 are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia".</li>
<li>"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years".</li>
<li>Human influence on the climate system is clear. It is extremely likely (95-100% probability) that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951-2010.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>"Increasing magnitudes of [global] warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts"</li>
<li>"A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability"</li>
<li>"The overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Without new policies to mitigate climate change, projections suggest an increase in global mean temperature in 2100 of <a href="/wiki/4_Degrees_and_Beyond_International_Climate_Conference" title="4 Degrees and Beyond International Climate Conference">3.7 to 4.8 °C</a>, relative to pre-industrial levels (<a href="/wiki/Median" title="Median">median</a> values; the range is 2.5 to 7.8 °C including climate uncertainty).</li>
<li>The current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels. Pledges made as part of the <a href="/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference" title="2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference">Cancún Agreements</a> are broadly consistent with cost-effective scenarios that give a "likely" chance (66-100% probability) of limiting global warming (in 2100) to below 3 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Projections in AR5 are based on "<a href="/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways" title="Representative Concentration Pathways">Representative Concentration Pathways</a>" (RCPs). The RCPs are consistent with a wide range of possible changes in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_reports">Special reports</span></h2>
<p>In addition to climate assessment reports, the IPCC is publishing Special Reports on specific topics. The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports. In the year 2011 two IPCC Special Report were finalized, the Special Report on <a href="/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Sources_and_Climate_Change_Mitigation" title="Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation">Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation</a> (SRREN) and the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). Both Special Reports were requested by governments.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios_.28SRES.29">Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios" title="Special Report on Emissions Scenarios">Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</a> (SRES) is a report by the IPCC which was published in 2000. The SRES contains "<a href="/wiki/Climate_change_scenario" title="Climate change scenario">scenarios</a>" of future changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>. One of the uses of the SRES scenarios is to project future changes in climate, e.g., changes in global mean temperature. The SRES scenarios were used in the IPCC's Third and Fourth Assessment Reports.</p>
<p>The SRES scenarios are "baseline" (or "reference") scenarios, which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>). SRES emissions projections are broadly comparable in range to the baseline projections that have been developed by the scientific community.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Comments_on_the_SRES">Comments on the SRES</span></h4>
<p>There have been a number of comments on the SRES. Parson <i>et al.</i> (2007) stated that the SRES represented "a substantial advance from prior scenarios". At the same time, there have been criticisms of the SRES.</p>
<p>The most prominently publicized criticism of SRES focused on the fact that all but one of the participating models compared gross domestic product (GDP) across regions using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Market_exchange_rate" title="Market exchange rate">market exchange rates</a> (MER), instead of the more correct <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Purchasing-power_parity" title="Purchasing-power parity">purchasing-power parity</a> (PPP) approach. This criticism is discussed in the <a href="/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios#MER_and_PPP" title="Special Report on Emissions Scenarios">main SRES article</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Methodology_reports">Methodology reports</span></h3>
<p>Within IPCC the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Program develops methodologies to estimate emissions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a>. This has been undertaken since 1991 by the IPCC WGI in close collaboration with the <a href="/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> and the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a>. The objectives of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to develop and refine an internationally agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals; and</li>
<li>to encourage the widespread use of this methodology by countries participating in the IPCC and by signatories of the UNFCCC.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Revised_1996_IPCC_Guidelines_for_National_Greenhouse_Gas_Inventories">Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</span></h4>
<p>The 1996 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Investories provide the methodological basis for the estimation of national greenhouse gas <a href="/wiki/Emission_inventory" title="Emission inventory">emissions inventories</a>. Over time these guidelines have been completed with good practice reports: <i>Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</i> and <i>Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry</i>.</p>

<p>The 2006 <i>IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</i> is the latest version of these emission estimation methodologies, including a large number of default emission factors. Although the IPCC prepared this new version of the guidelines on request of the parties to the UNFCCC, the methods have not yet been officially accepted for use in national greenhouse gas emissions reporting under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Activities">Activities</span></h2>
<p>The IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process. While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function, it also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, required under the UNFCCC. This involves publishing default <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emission_factor" title="Emission factor">emission factors</a>, which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production and so on.</p>
<p>The IPCC also often answers inquiries from the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Third_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Third Assessment Report">third assessment report (TAR)</a> prominently featured a graph labeled "Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction" based on a 1999 paper by <a href="/wiki/Michael_E._Mann" title="Michael E.

The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval <a href="/wiki/Wine_from_the_United_Kingdom" title="Wine from the United Kingdom">vineyards in England</a>. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007.

<p>These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity.

Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the <a href="/wiki/Soon_and_Baliunas_controversy" title="Soon and Baliunas controversy">Soon and Baliunas controversy</a>, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Inhofe" title="James Inhofe">James Inhofe</a> alleged that "manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people".

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservative_nature_of_IPCC_reports">Conservative nature of IPCC reports</span></h3>
<p>Some critics have contended that the IPCC reports tend to underestimate dangers, understate risks, and report only the "lowest common denominator" findings.</p>
<p>On 1 February 2007, the eve of the publication of IPCC's major report on climate, a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001. The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations. Over the six years studied, the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 projection, and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.</p>
<p>Another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC, far from overstating dangers and risks, have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels. When the researchers' analysis was "applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [50–140 cm] above 1990 levels. These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001". This may have been due, in part, to the expanding human understanding of climate.</p>
<p>In reporting criticism by some scientists that IPCC's then-impending January 2007 report understates certain risks, particularly sea level rises, an AP story quoted <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Rahmstorf" title="Stefan Rahmstorf">Stefan Rahmstorf</a>, professor of physics and oceanography at Potsdam University as saying "In a way, it is one of the strengths of the IPCC to be very conservative and cautious and not overstate any climate change risk".</p>
<p>In his December 2006 book, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hell_and_High_Water:_Global_Warming" title="Hell and High Water: Global Warming">Hell and High Water: Global Warming</a></i>, and in an interview on <a href="/wiki/Fox_News" title="Fox News">Fox News</a> on 31 January 2007, energy expert <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Romm" title="Joseph Romm">Joseph Romm</a> noted that the <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">IPCC Fourth Assessment Report</a> is already out of date and omits recent observations and factors contributing to global warming, such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing tundra.</p>
<p>Political influence on the IPCC has been documented by the release of a memo by ExxonMobil to the Bush administration, and its effects on the IPCC's leadership. The memo led to strong Bush administration lobbying, evidently at the behest of ExxonMobil, to oust <a href="/wiki/Robert_Watson_(scientist)" title="Robert Watson (scientist)">Robert Watson</a>, a climate scientist, from the IPCC chairmanship, and to have him replaced by Pachauri, who was seen at the time as more mild-mannered and industry-friendly.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="IPCC_processes">IPCC processes</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Michael_Oppenheimer" title="Michael Oppenheimer">Michael Oppenheimer</a>, a long-time participant in the IPCC and coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report conceded in <a href="/wiki/Science_Magazine" title="Science Magazine">Science Magazine</a>'s State of the Planet 2008–2009 some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring, smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous IPCC assessment reports. It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties. Others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the IPCC process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties.</p>
<p>The IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges (compare <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ozone_depletion_and_global_warming" title="Ozone depletion and global warming">Ozone depletion and global warming</a>). In case of the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_depletion" title="Ozone depletion">Ozone depletion</a> global regulation based on the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Protocol" title="Montreal Protocol">Montreal Protocol</a> has been successful, in case of Climate Change, the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> failed. The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process. The lockstep situation of the IPCC is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different, if not opposing goals. The underlying linear model of policy-making of <i>more knowledge we have, the better the political response will be</i> is being doubted.</p>
<p>According to Sheldon Ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties. The ozone case communicated to lay persons "with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>" and related to "immediate risks with everyday relevance", while the <a href="/wiki/Public_opinion_on_climate_change" title="Public opinion on climate change">public opinion on climate change</a> sees no imminent danger. The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the <a href="/wiki/Stern_Review" title="Stern Review">Stern Review</a> ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Outdatedness_of_reports">Outdatedness of reports</span></h3>
<p>Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies, and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release. In principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included. In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing, this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science. However, there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next.</p>
<p>The submission deadlines for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) differed for the reports of each Working Group. Deadlines for the Working Group I report were adjusted during the drafting and review process in order to ensure that reviewers had access to unpublished material being cited by the authors. The final deadline for cited publications was 24 July 2006. The final WG I report was released on 30 April 2007 and the final AR4 Synthesis Report was released on 17 November 2007.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rajendra_Pachauri" title="Rajendra Pachauri">Rajendra Pachauri</a>, the IPCC chair, admitted at the launch of this report that since the IPCC began work on it, scientists have recorded "much stronger trends in climate change", like the unforeseen dramatic melting of polar ice in the summer of 2007, and added, "that means you better start with intervention much earlier".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Burden_on_participating_scientists">Burden on participating scientists</span></h3>
<p>Scientists who participate in the IPCC assessment process do so without any compensation other than the normal salaries they receive from their home institutions. The process is labor-intensive, diverting time and resources from participating scientists' research programs. Concerns have been raised that the large uncompensated time commitment and disruption to their own research may discourage qualified scientists from participating.</p>
<p>In May 2010, Pachauri noted that the IPCC currently had no process for responding to errors or flaws once it issued a report. The problem, according to Pachauri, was that once a report was issued the panels of scientists producing the reports were disbanded.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposed_organizational_overhaul">Proposed organizational overhaul</span></h3>
<p>In February 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AR4" title="AR4">Fourth Assessment Report</a>, five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> calling for changes to the IPCC. They suggested a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body, or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_Forum#Moderators" title="Internet Forum">moderated</a> "living" Wikipedia-IPCC. Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="InterAcademy_Council_review">InterAcademy Council review</span></h2>
<p>In March 2010, at the invitation of the United Nations secretary-general and the chair of the IPCC, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/InterAcademy_Council" title="InterAcademy Council">InterAcademy Council</a> (IAC) was asked to review the IPCC's processes for developing its reports. The IAC panel, chaired by <a href="/wiki/Harold_Tafler_Shapiro" title="Harold Tafler Shapiro">Harold Tafler Shapiro</a>, convened on 14 May 2010 and released its report on 1 September 2010.</p>
<p>The IAC found that, "The IPCC assessment process has been successful overall". The panel, however, made seven formal recommendations for improving the IPCC's assessment process, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>establish an executive committee;</li>
<li>elect an executive director whose term would only last for one assessment;</li>
<li>encourage review editors to ensure that all reviewer comments are adequately considered and genuine controversies are adequately reflected in the assessment reports;</li>
<li>adopt a better process for responding to reviewer comments;</li>
<li>working groups should use a qualitative level-of-understanding scale in the Summary for Policy Makers and Technical Summary;</li>
<li>"Quantitative probabilities (as in the likelihood scale) should be used to describe the probability of well-defined outcomes only when there is sufficient evidence"; and</li>
<li>implement a communications plan that emphasizes transparency and establish guidelines for who can speak on behalf of the organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The panel also advised that the IPCC avoid appearing to advocate specific policies in response to its scientific conclusions. Commenting on the IAC report, <i>Nature News</i> noted that "The proposals were met with a largely favourable response from climate researchers who are eager to move on after the media scandals and credibility challenges that have rocked the United Nations body during the past nine months".</p>
