<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Methanol_fuel" title="Methanol fuel">Methanol fuel</a></div>
<p>Methanol is a fuel for heat engines and fuel cells. Due to its high <a href="/wiki/Octane_rating" title="Octane rating">octane rating</a> it can be used directly as a fuel in <a href="/wiki/Flexible-fuel_vehicle" title="Flexible-fuel vehicle">flex-fuel cars</a> (including <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle" title="Hybrid electric vehicle">hybrid</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid" title="Plug-in hybrid">plug-in hybrid</a> vehicles) using existing internal combustion engines (ICE). Methanol can also be used as a fuel in fuel cells, either directly in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct_Methanol_Fuel_Cell" title="Direct Methanol Fuel Cell">Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</a> (DMFC) or indirectly (after conversion into <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> by reforming).</p>
<p>In an economy based on methanol, methanol could be used as a fuel:</p>
<ul>
<li>In internal combustion engines (ICEs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Methanol has a high <a href="/wiki/Octane_rating" title="Octane rating">octane rating</a> (RON of 107 and MON of 92), making it a suitable gasoline substitute. It has a higher <a href="/wiki/Flame_speed" title="Flame speed">flame speed</a> than gasoline, leading to higher efficiency as well as a higher latent heat of vaporization (3.7 times higher than gasoline), meaning that the heat generated by the engine can be removed more effectively, making it possible to use air cooled engines. Methanol can have an efficiency increase of 5% to 10% relative to gasoline engine efficiency, if the compression ratio is increased. Methanol burns cleaner than gasoline and is safer in the case of a fire, but has only half the volumetric energy content of gasoline (15.6 MJ/L vs. 32.4 MJ/L).</p>
<ul>
<li>In compression ignition engines (<a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Methanol itself is not a good substitute for <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel fuels</a>. Methanol can, however, be converted by <a href="/wiki/Dehydration_reaction" title="Dehydration reaction">dehydration</a> to <a href="/wiki/Dimethyl_ether" title="Dimethyl ether">dimethyl ether</a>, which is a good diesel fuel with a <a href="/wiki/Cetane_number" title="Cetane number">cetane number</a> of 55-60 as compared to 45-55 for regular diesel fuel. This improves its cold-start ability in winters and reduces its noise. Compared to diesel fuel, DME has much lower emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and CO and emits no particulate matter, SO<sub>x</sub>. Methanol can also be, and is in fact already, used to produce <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> via <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a> of <a href="/wiki/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oil</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Straight_Vegetable_Oil" title="Straight Vegetable Oil">SVO</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>In advanced methanol-powered vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of methanol and dimethyl ether can be combined with hybrid and <a href="/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle" title="Plug-in electric vehicle">plug-in vehicle</a> technologies allowing higher gas mileage and lower emissions. These fuels can also be used in fuel cells either via onboard reforming to hydrogen or directly in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct_Methanol_Fuel_Cells" title="Direct Methanol Fuel Cells">Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</a> (DMFC).</p>
<ul>
<li>For electricity production</li>
</ul>
<p>Methanol and DME can be used in existing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas_turbines" title="Gas turbines">gas turbines</a> to generate electricity. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fuel_cells" title="Fuel cells">Fuel cells</a> (PAFC, MCFC, SOFC) can also be used for electricity generation.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a domestic fuel</li>
</ul>
<p>Methanol and DME can be used in commercial buildings and homes to generate heat and/or electricity. DME can be used in a commercial gas stove without modifications. DME can also be blended with LPG and used as a cooking or heating fuel as is already the case in China. In developing countries methanol could be used as a cooking fuel, burning much cleaner than wood and thus mitigating indoor air quality problems.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Precursor">Precursor</span></h3>
<p>Methanol is already used today on a large scale as raw material to produce a variety of chemicals and products. Through the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process, it can be transformed into gasoline. Using the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process, methanol can also be converted to <a href="/wiki/Ethylene" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propylene" title="Propylene">propylene</a>, the two chemicals produced in largest amounts by the petrochemical industry. These are important building blocks for the production of essential polymers (LDPE, HDPE, PP) and like other chemical intermediates are currently produced mainly from petroleum feedstock. Their production from methanol could therefore reduce our dependency on petroleum. It would also make it possible to continue producing these chemicals when fossil fuels reserves are depleted.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>Methanol is already used today on a large scale (about 37 million tonnes per year) as feedstock to produce numerous chemical products and materials. In addition, it can be readily converted in the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Methanol-to-olefin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Methanol-to-olefin (page does not exist)">methanol-to-olefin</a> (MTO) process into <a href="/wiki/Ethylene" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propylene" title="Propylene">propylene</a>, industrial chemicals which can be used to produce synthetic hydrocarbons and their products, currently obtained from oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>Today most <a href="/wiki/Methanol" title="Methanol">methanol</a> is produced from <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> through <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a>. <a href="/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> is currently the world's largest methanol exporter, with exports mainly to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Although conventional natural gas resources are currently the preferred feedstock for the production of methanol, unconventional gas resources such as <a href="/wiki/Coalbed_methane" title="Coalbed methane">coalbed methane</a>, tight sand gas and eventually the very large <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methane_hydrate" title="Methane hydrate">methane hydrate</a> resources present under the continental shelves of the seas and Siberian and Canadian tundra could also be used. Besides methane all other conventional or unconventional (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tar_sands" title="Tar sands">tar sands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oil_shale" title="Oil shale">oil shale</a>,etc.) fossil fuels could be utilized to produce methanol.</p>
<p>Besides the conventional route to methanol from <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> passing through syngas generation by <a href="/wiki/Steam_reforming" title="Steam reforming">steam reforming</a> combined (or not) with partial oxidation, new and more efficient ways to produce methanol from methane are being developed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methane oxidation with homogeneous catalysts in <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> media</li>
<li>Methane bromination followed by hydrolysis of the obtained <a href="/wiki/Bromomethane" title="Bromomethane">bromomethane</a></li>
<li>Direct oxidation of methane with oxygen</li>
<li>Microbial or photochemical conversion of methane</li>
</ul>
<p>All these synthetic routes emit the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> CO<sub>2</sub>. To mitigate this, methanol can be made through ways minimizing the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>. One solution is to produce it from syngas obtained by biomass gasification. For this purpose any biomass can be used including <a href="/wiki/Wood_economy" title="Wood economy">wood</a>, wood wastes, grass, agricultural crops and their by-products, animal waste, aquatic plants and municipal waste. There is no need to use food crops as in the case of ethanol from corn, sugar cane and wheat.</p>

<p>Methanol can be synthesized from carbon and hydrogen from any source, including still available <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>. CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industries and eventually even the CO<sub>2</sub> contained in the air, can be a source of carbon. It can also be made from chemical recycling of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, which <a href="/wiki/Carbon_Recycling_International" title="Carbon Recycling International">Carbon Recycling International</a> has demonstrated with its first commercial scale plant. Initially the major source will be the CO<sub>2</sub> rich flue gases of fossil-fuel-burning power plants or exhaust from cement and other factories. In the longer range however, considering diminishing fossil fuel resources and the effect of their utilization on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">earth's atmosphere</a>, even the low concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> itself could be captured and recycled via methanol, thus supplementing nature’s own photosynthetic cycle. Efficient new absorbents to capture atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are being developed, mimicking plants' ability. Chemical recycling of CO<sub>2</sub> to new fuels and materials could thus become feasible, making them renewable on the human timescale.</p>
<p>Methanol can also be produced from CO<sub>2</sub> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalytic_hydrogenation" title="Catalytic hydrogenation">catalytic hydrogenation</a> of CO<sub>2</sub> with H<sub>2</sub> where the hydrogen has been obtained from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_electrolysis" title="Water electrolysis">water electrolysis</a>. This is the process used by <a href="/wiki/Carbon_Recycling_International" title="Carbon Recycling International">Carbon Recycling International</a> of <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Methanol may also be produced through CO<sub>2</sub> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrochemical_reduction" title="Electrochemical reduction">electrochemical reduction</a>, if electrical power is available. The energy needed for these reactions in order to be carbon neutral would come from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectricity and solar as well as nuclear power. In effect, all of them allow free energy to be stored in easily transportable methanol, which is made immediately from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, rather than attempting to store energy in free hydrogen.</p>

<p>or with electric energy</p>

<p>The necessary CO<sub>2</sub> would be captured from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industrial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flue_gases" title="Flue gases">flue gases</a> including cement factories. With diminishing fossil fuel resources and therefore CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the CO<sub>2</sub> content in the air could also be used. Considering the low concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in air (0.04%) improved and economically viable technologies to absorb CO<sub>2</sub> will have to be developed. This would allow the chemical recycling of CO<sub>2</sub>, thus mimicking nature’s photosynthesis.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Advantages">Advantages</span></h2>
<p>In the process of <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, green plants use the energy of sunlight to split water into free oxygen (which is released) and free hydrogen. Rather than attempt to store the hydrogen, plants immediately capture carbon dioxide from the air to allow the hydrogen to reduce it to storable fuels such as hydrocarbons (plant oils and <a href="/wiki/Terpene" title="Terpene">terpenes</a>) and polyalcohols (<a href="/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Starch" title="Starch">starches</a>). In the methanol economy, any process which similarly produces free hydrogen, proposes to immediately use it "captively" to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol, which, like plant products from photosynthesis, has great advantages in storage and transport over free hydrogen itself.</p>
<p>Methanol is a liquid under normal conditions, allowing it to be stored, transported and dispensed easily, much like <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel fuel</a>. It can also be readily transformed by dehydration into <a href="/wiki/Dimethyl_ether" title="Dimethyl ether">dimethyl ether</a>, a diesel fuel substitute with a <a href="/wiki/Cetane_number" title="Cetane number">cetane number</a> of 55.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_with_hydrogen">Comparison with hydrogen</span></h3>
<p>Methanol economy advantages compared to a hydrogen economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient energy storage by volume, as compared with <a href="/wiki/Compressed_hydrogen" title="Compressed hydrogen">compressed hydrogen</a>. And when hydrogen pressure-confinement vessel is taken into account, an advantage in energy storage by weight can also be realized. The volumetric energy density of methanol is considerably higher than liquid hydrogen, in part because of the low density of liquid hydrogen of 71 grams/litre. Hence there is actually more hydrogen in a litre of methanol (99 grams/litre) than in a litre of liquid hydrogen, and methanol needs no cryogenic container maintained at a temperature of -253 °C .</li>
<li>A liquid hydrogen infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive. Methanol can use existing gasoline infrastructure with only limited modifications.</li>
<li>Can be blended with gasoline (for example in <a href="/wiki/M85_fuel" title="M85 fuel">M85</a>, a mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline).</li>
<li>User friendly. Hydrogen is volatile and requires high pressure or cryogenic system confinement.</li>
<li>Less losses : making storage systems hydrogen leakage proof is a lot more difficult then preventing leakage from methanol. With liquid hydrogen heat will evaporate liquid, giving expected losses up to 0.3% per day in storage tanks due to release of overpressure (see <a class="external text" href="http://www.chart-ferox.com/getattachment/37f20eca-f9ee-4eaa-88c7-0f373e93f8ca/VT_FULL_EN.aspx" rel="nofollow">Chart Ferox storage tanks Liquid oxygen</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Methanol may be viewed as a compact way of storing hydrogen. One m of methanol at ambient pressure and temperature contains 1660 Nm (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Normal_cubic_metre" title="Normal cubic metre">normal cubic metres</a>) of hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). This may be compared to <a href="/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen" title="Liquid hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> where one m of liquid hydrogen (LH2) at -253 °C contains only 788 Nm of hydrogen gas.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_with_ethanol">Comparison with ethanol</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be made from any organic material using proven technology going through syngas. There is no need to use food crops and compete with food production. The amount of methanol that can be generated from biomass is much greater than ethanol.</li>
<li>Can compete with and complement ethanol in a diversified energy marketplace. Methanol obtained from fossil fuels has a lower price than ethanol.</li>
<li>Can be blended in gasoline like ethanol. In 2007, China blended more than 1 billion US gallons (3,800,000 m) of methanol into fuel and will introduce methanol fuel standard by mid-2008. <a href="/wiki/M85_fuel" title="M85 fuel">M85</a>, a mixture of 85% methanol and 15% gasoline can be used much like <a href="/wiki/E85" title="E85">E85</a> sold in some gas stations today.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>High energy costs associated with generating hydrogen (when needed to synthesize methanol)</li>
<li>Depending on the feedstock the generation in itself may be not clean</li>
<li>Presently generated from <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a> still dependent on fossil fuels (although in theory any energy source can be used).</li>
<li>Energy density (by weight or volume) one half of that of gasoline and 24% less than ethanol</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corrosive" title="Corrosive">Corrosive</a> to some metals including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aluminum" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a>. Parts of the engine fuel-intake systems are made from aluminum. Similar to ethanol, compatible material for fuel tanks, gasket and engine intake have to be used.</li>
<li>As with <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport#Ethanol" title="Pipeline transport">similarly corrosive and hydrophilic ethanol</a>, existing <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipelines</a> designed for petroleum products cannot handle methanol. Thus methanol requires shipment at higher energy cost in trucks and trains, until a whole new pipeline infrastructure can be built.</li>
<li>Methanol, as an alcohol, increases the permeability of some plastics to fuel vapors (e.g. high-density polyethylene). This property of methanol has the possibility of increasing emissions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) from fuel, which contributes to increased tropospheric <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> and possibly human exposure.</li>
<li>Low volatility in cold weather: pure methanol-fueled engines can be difficult to start, and they run inefficiently until warmed up. This is why a mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline called M85 is generally used in ICEs. The gasoline allows the engine to start even at lower temperatures.</li>
<li>With the exception of low level exposure, methanol is toxic. Methanol is lethal when ingested in larger amounts (30 to 100 mL). But so are most motor fuels, including gasoline (120 to 300 mL) and diesel fuel. Gasoline also contains many compounds known to be carcinogenic (e.g. benzene). Methanol is not a carcinogen, nor does it contain any carcinogens. However, methanol may be metabolized in the body to formaldehyde, which is both toxic and carcinogenic. Methanol occurs naturally in small quantities in the human body and in edible fruits.</li>
<li>Methanol is a liquid: this creates a greater fire risk compared to hydrogen in open spaces. Methanol leaks do not dissipate. A methanol-based fire burns invisibly unlike gasoline. Compared to gasoline, however, methanol is much safer. It is more difficult to ignite and releases less heat when it burns. Methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water, whereas gasoline floats on water and continues to burn. The EPA has estimated that switching fuels from gasoline to methanol would reduce the incidence of fuel related fires by 90%.</li>
<li>Methanol accidentally released from leaking underground fuel storage tanks may undergo relatively rapid groundwater transport and contaminate well water, although this risk has not been thoroughly studied. The history of the fuel additive methyl t-butyl ether (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MTBE" title="MTBE">MTBE</a>) as a groundwater contaminant has highlighted the importance of assessing the potential impacts of fuel and fuel additives on multiple environmental media. An accidental release of methanol in the environment would, however, cause much less damage than a comparable gasoline or crude oil spill. Unlike these fuels, methanol, being totally soluble in water, would be rapidly diluted to a concentration low enough for <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganism</a> to start <a href="/wiki/Biodegradation" title="Biodegradation">biodegradation</a>. Methanol is in fact used for <a href="/wiki/Denitrification" title="Denitrification">denitrification</a> in water treatment plants as a nutrient for bacteria.</li>
