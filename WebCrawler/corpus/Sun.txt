<p>The <b>Sun</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Star" title="Star">star</a> at the center of the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a>. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot <a href="/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a>, with internal <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convective</a> motion that generates a <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> via a <a href="/wiki/Solar_dynamo" title="Solar dynamo">dynamo process</a>. It is by far the most important source of <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> for <a href="/wiki/Life" title="Life">life</a> on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and <a href="/wiki/Solar_mass" title="Solar mass">its mass</a> is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> (~73%); the rest is mostly <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neon" title="Neon">neon</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a>.</p>

It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" title="Gravitational collapse">gravitational collapse</a> of matter within a region of a large <a href="/wiki/Molecular_cloud" title="Molecular cloud">molecular cloud</a>. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that <a href="/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System" title="Formation and evolution of the Solar System">became the Solar System</a>.

It is thought that almost all stars <a href="/wiki/Star_formation" title="Star formation">form by this process</a>.</p>
<p>The Sun is roughly middle-aged: it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen_fusion" title="Hydrogen fusion">hydrogen fusion</a> in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes and become a <a href="/wiki/Red_giant" title="Red giant">red giant</a>.

The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (<a href="/wiki/Sol_Invictus" title="Sol Invictus">Sol Invictus</a>).

<p>The Sun is a <a href="/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" title="G-type main-sequence star">G-type main-sequence star</a> that comprises about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. The Sun has an <a href="/wiki/Absolute_magnitude" title="Absolute magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>, most of which are <a href="/wiki/Red_dwarf" title="Red dwarf">red dwarfs</a>. The Sun is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_I_stars" title="Population I stars">Population I</a>, or heavy-element-rich, star. The formation of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby <a href="/wiki/Supernova" title="Supernova">supernovae</a>. This is suggested by a high <a href="/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements" title="Abundance of the chemical elements">abundance</a> of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as <a href="/wiki/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_II" title="Population II">Population II</a>, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Endothermic" title="Endothermic">endothermic</a> nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">transmutation</a> through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neutron_absorption" title="Neutron absorption">neutron absorption</a> within a massive second-generation star.</p>
<p>The Sun is by far the brightest object in the sky, with an <a href="/wiki/Apparent_magnitude" title="Apparent magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of −26.74. This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, <a href="/wiki/Sirius" title="Sirius">Sirius</a>, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The mean distance of the Sun's center to Earth's center is approximately 1 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">astronomical unit</a> (about 150,000,000 km; 93,000,000 mi), though the distance varies as Earth moves from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Perihelion" title="Perihelion">perihelion</a> in January to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aphelion" title="Aphelion">aphelion</a> in July. At this average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 19 seconds, while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> supports almost all life on Earth by <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, and drives <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_climate" title="Earth's climate">Earth's climate</a> and weather.</p>
<p>The Sun does not have a definite boundary, and in its outer parts its density decreases exponentially with increasing distance from its center. For the purpose of measurement, however, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the <a href="/wiki/Photosphere" title="Photosphere">photosphere</a>, the apparent visible surface of the Sun. By this measure, the Sun is a near-perfect sphere with an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oblateness" title="Oblateness">oblateness</a> estimated at about 9 millionths, which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometres (6.2 mi). The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its <a href="/wiki/Equator" title="Equator">equator</a> than at its <a href="/wiki/Poles_of_astronomical_bodies" title="Poles of astronomical bodies">poles</a>. This <a href="/wiki/Solar_rotation" title="Solar rotation">differential rotation</a> is caused by <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convective motion</a> due to heat transport and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">Coriolis force</a> due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the <i>apparent rotational period</i> of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Solar_constant" title="Solar constant">solar constant</a> is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7003136800000000000♠</span>1,368 W/m</span> (watts per square meter) at a distance of one <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">astronomical unit</a> (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth). Sunlight on the surface of Earth is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attenuation_(electromagnetic_radiation)" title="Attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)">attenuated</a> by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7003100000000000000♠</span>1,000 W/m</span>) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the <a href="/wiki/Zenith" title="Zenith">zenith</a>. Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light. The atmosphere in particular filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths. Solar <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation" title="Ultraviolet radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting <a href="/wiki/Ionosphere" title="Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>.</p>
<p>The Sun's color is white, with a <a href="/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space" title="CIE 1931 color space">CIE</a> color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When measuring all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, <a href="/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation" title="Diffuse sky radiation">atmospheric scattering</a> renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; the reasons for this are the subject of debate. The Sun is a <a href="/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" title="G-type main-sequence star">G2V</a> star, with <i>G2</i> indicating its <a href="/wiki/Effective_temperature" title="Effective temperature">surface temperature</a> of approximately 5,778 K (5,505 °C, 9,941 °F), and <i>V</i> that it, like most stars, is a <a href="/wiki/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main-sequence</a> star.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Composition">Composition</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Molecules_in_stars" title="Molecules in stars">Molecules in stars</a></div>
<p>The Sun is composed primarily of the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements, called <i><a href="/wiki/Metallicity" title="Metallicity">metals</a></i> in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.</p>
<p>The Sun inherited its chemical composition from the <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a> out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="Big Bang nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>, and the heavier elements were produced by <a href="/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" title="Stellar nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> in generations of stars that completed their <a href="/wiki/Stellar_evolution" title="Stellar evolution">stellar evolution</a> and returned their material to the interstellar medium before the formation of the Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the <a href="/wiki/Metallicity" title="Metallicity">metallicity</a> is only 84% of what it was in the <a href="/wiki/Protostar" title="Protostar">protostellar</a> phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition is believed to have been 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.</p>
<p>Today, nuclear fusion in the Sun's core has modified the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost portion of the Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the abundance of heavier elements unchanged. Because heat is transferred from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see <a href="#Radiative_zone">Radiative zone</a> below), none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere.</p>
<p>The reactive core zone of "hydrogen burning", where hydrogen is converted into helium, is starting to surround an inner core of "helium ash". This development will continue and will eventually cause the Sun to leave the <a href="/wiki/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main sequence</a>, to become a <a href="/wiki/Red_giant" title="Red giant">red giant</a>.</p>
<p>The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy" title="Astronomical spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a> of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meteorites" title="Meteorites">meteorites</a> that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Singly_ionized_iron-group_elements">Singly ionized iron-group elements</span></h3>
<p>In the 1970s, much research focused on the abundances of <a href="/wiki/Iron_group" title="Iron group">iron-group</a> elements in the Sun. Although significant research was done, until 1978 it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a>) via <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spectrography" title="Spectrography">spectrography</a> because of their <a href="/wiki/Hyperfine_structure" title="Hyperfine structure">hyperfine structures</a>.</p>
<p>The first largely complete set of <a href="/wiki/Oscillator_strength" title="Oscillator strength">oscillator strengths</a> of singly ionized iron-group elements were made available in the 1960s, and these were subsequently improved. In 1978, the abundances of singly ionized elements of the iron group were derived.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Isotopic_composition">Isotopic composition</span></h3>

<p>Prior to 1983, it was thought that the whole Sun has the same composition as the solar atmosphere.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Solar_core" title="Solar core">Solar core</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Solar_core" title="Solar core">core</a> of the Sun extends from the center to about 20–25% of the solar radius. It has a density of up to <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7005150000000000000♠</span>150 g/cm</span> (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">kelvins</a> (K). By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5,800 K. Recent analysis of <a href="/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory" title="Solar and Heliospheric Observatory">SOHO</a> mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above. Through most of the Sun's life, energy is produced by <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" title="Nuclear fusion">nuclear fusion</a> in the core region through a series of steps called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proton-proton_chain_reaction" title="Proton-proton chain reaction">p–p (proton–proton) chain</a>; this process converts <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> into <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>. Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the <a href="/wiki/CNO_cycle" title="CNO cycle">CNO cycle</a>, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older.</p>
<p>The core is the only region in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of <a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy" title="Thermal energy">thermal energy</a> through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. The remainder of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space as sunlight or the <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of particles.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain" title="Proton–proton chain">proton–proton chain</a> occurs around <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7037919999999999999♠</span>9.2<span style="margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em;">×</span>10</span> times each second in the core, converting about 3.7<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 protons into <a href="/wiki/Alpha_particle" title="Alpha particle">alpha particles</a> (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 kg/s.

<p>The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and <a href="/wiki/Thermal_expansion" title="Thermal expansion">expand</a> slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the <a href="/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)" title="Perturbation (astronomy)">perturbation</a>; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.</p>

This <a href="/wiki/Temperature_gradient" title="Temperature gradient">temperature gradient</a> is less than the value of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Adiabatic lapse rate">adiabatic lapse rate</a> and hence cannot drive convection, hence, energy is transferred by <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ions" title="Ions">Ions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> emit <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photons" title="Photons">photons</a>, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm to only 0.2 g/cm) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.</p>

<p>The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the <a href="/wiki/Tachocline" title="Tachocline">tachocline</a>. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. The fluid motion of the convection zone above, slowly disappears from the top of this layer to its bottom where it matches that of the radiative zone. Presently, it is hypothesized (see <a href="/wiki/Solar_dynamo" title="Solar dynamo">Solar dynamo</a>) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Convective_zone">Convective zone</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Convection_zone" title="Convection zone">Convection zone</a></div>
<p>The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (200,000 km) to near the surface. In this layer, the temperature is lower than in the radiative zone and heavier atoms are not fully ionized. As a result, radiative heat transport is less effective and convection moves the Sun's energy outward through this layer. The density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into <a href="/wiki/Thermal" title="Thermal">thermal cells</a> that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).</p>
<p>The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the <a href="/wiki/Granule_(solar_physics)" title="Granule (solar physics)">solar granulation</a> at the smallest scale and <a href="/wiki/Supergranulation" title="Supergranulation">supergranulation</a> at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains "small-scale" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun. The Sun's thermal columns are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/B%C3%A9nard_cells" title="Bénard cells">Bénard cells</a> and take the shape of hexagonal prisms.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Photosphere">Photosphere</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Photosphere" title="Photosphere">Photosphere</a></div>
<p>The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes <a href="/wiki/Opacity_(optics)" title="Opacity (optics)">opaque</a> to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_anion" title="Hydrogen anion">H ions</a>, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atoms to produce H ions. The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or <i>limb</i> of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as <a href="/wiki/Limb_darkening" title="Limb darkening">limb darkening</a>. The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black-body" title="Black-body">black-body</a> radiating at about 6,000 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a>, interspersed with atomic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absorption_line" title="Absorption line">absorption lines</a> from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~10 m (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.</p>
<p>During early studies of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optical_spectrum" title="Optical spectrum">optical spectrum</a> of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> then known on Earth. In 1868, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Lockyer" title="Norman Lockyer">Norman Lockyer</a> hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed <i><a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a></i>, after the Greek Sun god <a href="/wiki/Helios" title="Helios">Helios</a>. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.</p>

<p>During a total <a href="/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a>, when the disk of the Sun is covered by that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's surrounding atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the <a href="/wiki/Chromosphere" title="Chromosphere">chromosphere</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Solar_transition_region" title="Solar transition region">transition region</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Corona" title="Corona">corona</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Heliosphere" title="Heliosphere">heliosphere</a>.</p>
<p>The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7005500000000000000♠</span>500 km</span> above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7003410000000000000♠</span>4,100 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a></span>. This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and water, which can be detected via their absorption spectra.</p>
<p>The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun. The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that <a href="/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave" title="Alfvén wave">Alfvén waves</a> may have enough energy to heat the corona.</p>
<p>Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7006200000000000000♠</span>2,000 km</span> thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines. It is called the <i>chromosphere</i> from the Greek root <i>chroma</i>, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total <a href="/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipses</a>. The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7004200000000000000♠</span>20,000 K</span> near the top. In the upper part of the chromosphere <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> becomes partially <a href="/wiki/Ionization" title="Ionization">ionized</a>.</p>

<p>Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) <a href="/wiki/Solar_transition_region" title="Solar transition region">transition region</a>, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a> in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a>. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of <a href="/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)" title="Halo (optical phenomenon)">nimbus</a> around chromospheric features such as <a href="/wiki/Spicule_(solar_physics)" title="Spicule (solar physics)">spicules</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_filament" title="Solar filament">filaments</a>, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">space</a> by instruments sensitive to the <a href="/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet" title="Extreme ultraviolet">extreme ultraviolet</a> portion of the <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Corona" title="Corona">corona</a> is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 10 m to 10 m. The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection" title="Magnetic reconnection">magnetic reconnection</a>. The corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Heliosphere" title="Heliosphere">heliosphere</a>, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with the solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a> becomes <i>superalfvénic</i>—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of <a href="/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave" title="Alfvén wave">Alfvén waves</a>, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parker_spiral" title="Parker spiral">spiral</a> shape, until it impacts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heliopause_(astronomy)" title="Heliopause (astronomy)">heliopause</a> more than 50 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">AU</a> from the Sun. In December 2004, the <a href="/wiki/Voyager_1" title="Voyager 1">Voyager 1</a> probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_ray" title="Cosmic ray">cosmic ray</a> collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Photons_and_neutrinos">Photons and neutrinos</span></h3>
<p>High-energy <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma-ray</a> photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the <a href="/wiki/Neutrino" title="Neutrino">neutrinos</a>, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were <a href="/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem" title="Solar neutrino problem">lower than theories predicted</a> by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of <a href="/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation" title="Neutrino oscillation">neutrino oscillation</a>: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the <a href="/wiki/Theory" title="Theory">theory</a>, but neutrino detectors were missing <span class="nowrap"> </span><span class="frac nowrap">⁄<sub>3</sub></span> of them because the neutrinos had changed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flavor_(particle_physics)" title="Flavor (particle physics)">flavor</a> by the time they were detected.</p>

<p>The Sun has a <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> that varies across the surface of the Sun. Its polar field is 1–2 <a href="/wiki/Gauss_(unit)" title="Gauss (unit)">gauss</a> (0.0001–0.0002 <a href="/wiki/Tesla_(unit)" title="Tesla (unit)">T</a>), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called <a href="/wiki/Sunspot" title="Sunspot">sunspots</a> and 10–100 gauss (0.001–0.01 T) in <a href="/wiki/Solar_prominence" title="Solar prominence">solar prominences</a>.</p>
<p>The magnetic field also varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year <a href="/wiki/Solar_cycle" title="Solar cycle">solar cycle</a> is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.</p>
<p>Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's <a href="/wiki/Photosphere" title="Photosphere">photosphere</a>, and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convective transport</a> of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical <a href="/wiki/Solar_minimum" title="Solar minimum">solar minimum</a>, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its <a href="/wiki/Solar_maximum" title="Solar maximum">maximum</a>, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as <a href="/wiki/Sp%C3%B6rer%27s_law" title="Spörer's law">Spörer's law</a>. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.</p>
<p>An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year <a href="/wiki/Babcock_Model" title="Babcock Model">Babcock</a>–Leighton <a href="/wiki/Solar_dynamo" title="Solar dynamo">dynamo</a> cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between <a href="/wiki/Toroidal_and_poloidal" title="Toroidal and poloidal">toroidal and poloidal</a> solar magnetic fields. At <a href="/wiki/Solar_maximum" title="Solar maximum">solar-cycle maximum</a>, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal <a href="/wiki/Toroidal_and_poloidal" title="Toroidal and poloidal">toroidal</a> quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.</p>
<p>During the solar cycle’s declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number. At <a href="/wiki/Solar_minimum" title="Solar minimum">solar-cycle minimum</a>, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.</p>
<p>The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the <a href="/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field" title="Interplanetary magnetic field">interplanetary magnetic field</a>. In an approximation known as ideal <a href="/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics" title="Magnetohydrodynamics">magnetohydrodynamics</a>, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin <a href="/wiki/Heliospheric_current_sheet" title="Heliospheric current sheet">current sheet</a> is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an <a href="/wiki/Archimedean_spiral" title="Archimedean spiral">Archimedean spiral</a> structure called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parker_spiral" title="Parker spiral">Parker spiral</a>. The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400 <a href="/wiki/Tesla_(unit)" title="Tesla (unit)">μT</a> (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1 nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5 nT, about a hundred times greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Variation_in_activity">Variation in activity</span></h3>

<p>The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_variation" title="Solar variation">solar activity</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_flares" title="Solar flares">Solar flares</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejections" title="Coronal mass ejections">coronal-mass ejections</a> tend to occur at sunspot groups.

Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and <a href="/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field" title="Interplanetary magnetic field">interplanetary magnetic field</a> outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)" title="Aurora (astronomy)">auroras</a> at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" title="Electric power">electric power</a>.

<p>With solar-cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding modulation of <a href="/wiki/Space_weather" title="Space weather">space weather</a> conditions, including those surrounding Earth where technological systems can be affected.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Long-term_change">Long-term change</span></h3>
<p>Long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought, by some scientists, to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance, which, in turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate. For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maunder_minimum" title="Maunder minimum">Maunder minimum</a>. This coincided in time with the era of the <a href="/wiki/Little_Ice_Age" title="Little Ice Age">Little Ice Age</a>, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tree_ring" title="Tree ring">tree rings</a> and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.</p>
<p>A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years. These could provide a better explanation of the <a href="/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice ages</a> than the <a href="/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" title="Milankovitch cycles">Milankovitch cycles</a>.</p>

<p>The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life. It has not changed dramatically for over four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes, both internally and externally.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Formation">Formation</span></h3>
<p>The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant <a href="/wiki/Molecular_cloud" title="Molecular cloud">molecular cloud</a> that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars. This age is estimated using <a href="/wiki/Computer_simulation" title="Computer simulation">computer models</a> of <a href="/wiki/Stellar_evolution" title="Stellar evolution">stellar evolution</a> and through <a href="/wiki/Nucleocosmochronology" title="Nucleocosmochronology">nucleocosmochronology</a>. The result is consistent with the <a href="/wiki/Radiometric_dating" title="Radiometric dating">radiometric date</a> of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago. Studies of ancient <a href="/wiki/Meteorite" title="Meteorite">meteorites</a> reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iron-60" title="Iron-60">iron-60</a>, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A <a href="/wiki/Shock_wave" title="Shock wave">shock wave</a> from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity. As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum" title="Conservation of angular momentum">conservation of angular momentum</a> and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering <a href="/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" title="Stellar nucleosynthesis">nuclear fusion</a>. Thus, the Sun was born.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Main_sequence">Main sequence</span></h3>

<p>The Sun is about halfway through its <a href="/wiki/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main-sequence</a> stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing <a href="/wiki/Neutrino" title="Neutrino">neutrinos</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_radiation" title="Solar radiation">solar radiation</a>. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1000000000_(number)" title="1000000000 (number)">billion</a> years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_atom" title="Hydrogen atom">hydrogen atoms</a> that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the <a href="/wiki/Inverse-square_law" title="Inverse-square law">inverse-square law</a>. This stronger force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion">After core hydrogen exhaustion</span></h3>

<p>The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a <a href="/wiki/Supernova" title="Supernova">supernova</a>. Instead it will exit the <a href="/wiki/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main sequence</a> in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a <a href="/wiki/Red_giant" title="Red giant">red giant</a>. As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.</p>
<p>Even before it becomes a red giant, the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will be hotter than Venus is today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a <a href="/wiki/Subgiant" title="Subgiant">subgiant</a> phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous. This then starts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_giant_branch" title="Red giant branch">red-giant-branch</a> phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.</p>

<p>After the red-giant branch the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core, full of <a href="/wiki/Degenerate_matter" title="Degenerate matter">degenerate</a> helium ignites violently in the <a href="/wiki/Helium_flash" title="Helium flash">helium flash</a>, where it is estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the <a href="/wiki/Triple-alpha_process" title="Triple-alpha process">triple-alpha process</a>. The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the <a href="/wiki/Red_clump" title="Red clump">red clump</a> or <a href="/wiki/Horizontal_branch" title="Horizontal branch">horizontal branch</a>, but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core.</p>
<p>When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the <a href="/wiki/Asymptotic_giant_branch" title="Asymptotic giant branch">asymptotic-giant-branch</a> phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_pulse" title="Thermal pulse">thermal pulses</a> that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU. According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tidal_forces" title="Tidal forces">tidal forces</a> (and, eventually, drag from the lower <a href="/wiki/Chromosphere" title="Chromosphere">chromosphere</a>), so that it is engulfed by the Sun near the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius. For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a <a href="/wiki/Planetary_nebula" title="Planetary nebula">planetary nebula</a>. By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.</p>
<p>The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionised into a <a href="/wiki/Planetary_nebula" title="Planetary nebula">planetary nebula</a> as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K. The final naked core, a <a href="/wiki/White_dwarf" title="White dwarf">white dwarf</a>, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K, and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present day mass. The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical <a href="/wiki/Black_dwarf" title="Black dwarf">black</a>.</p>

The Sun is contained within the <a href="/wiki/Local_Bubble" title="Local Bubble">Local Bubble</a>, a space of rarefied hot gas, possibly produced by the supernova remnant <a href="/wiki/Geminga" title="Geminga">Geminga</a>. The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the <a href="/wiki/Perseus_Arm" title="Perseus Arm">Perseus Arm</a>, is about 6,500 light-years. The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is found in what scientists call the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_habitable_zone" title="Galactic habitable zone">galactic habitable zone</a>. The <i>Apex of the Sun's Way</i>, or the <a href="/wiki/Solar_apex" title="Solar apex">solar apex</a>, is the direction that the Sun travels relative to other nearby stars.

Of the 50 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nearest_stars" title="Nearest stars">nearest stellar systems</a> within 17 light-years from Earth (the closest being the red dwarf <a href="/wiki/Proxima_Centauri" title="Proxima Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a> at approximately 4.2 light-years), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.</p>
<p>The Sun is orbiting the center of the Milky Way, going in the direction of <a href="/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)" title="Cygnus (constellation)">Cygnus</a>. The Sun's orbit around the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. It has been argued that the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mass_extinction" title="Mass extinction">mass extinctions</a> on Earth, perhaps due to increased <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Impact_events" title="Impact events">impact events</a>. It takes the Solar System about 225–250 million years to complete one orbit through the Milky Way (a <i><a href="/wiki/Galactic_year" title="Galactic year">galactic year</a></i>), so it is thought to have completed 20–25 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun. The <a href="/wiki/Orbital_speed" title="Orbital speed">orbital speed</a> of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is approximately 251 km/s (156 mi/s).

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Corona" title="Corona">Corona</a></div>
<p>The temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 K, whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000–2,000,000 K. The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_conduction" title="Heat conduction">heat conduction</a> from the photosphere.</p>
<p>It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is <a href="/wiki/Wave" title="Wave">wave</a> heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat. The other is <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic</a> heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection" title="Magnetic reconnection">magnetic reconnection</a> in the form of large <a href="/wiki/Solar_flare" title="Solar flare">solar flares</a> and myriad similar but smaller events—<a href="/wiki/Nanoflares" title="Nanoflares">nanoflares</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except <a href="/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave" title="Alfvén wave">Alfvén waves</a> have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.</p>

<p>Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the <a href="/wiki/Archean" title="Archean">Archean period</a>, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today.

However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. The consensus among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> reaching it.</p>

<p>The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the <a href="/wiki/Sky" title="Sky">sky</a>, whose presence above the <a href="/wiki/Horizon" title="Horizon">horizon</a> creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a <a href="/wiki/Solar_deity" title="Solar deity">solar deity</a> or other <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> entity. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sun_worship" title="Sun worship">Worship of the Sun</a> was central to civilizations such as the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inca" title="Inca">Inca</a> of South America and the <a href="/wiki/Aztec" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a> of what is now <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. In religions such as <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, the Sun is still considered a god.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Development_of_scientific_understanding">Development of scientific understanding</span></h3>
<p>In the early first millennium BC, <a href="/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy" title="Babylonian astronomy">Babylonian astronomers</a> observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> in an <a href="/wiki/Elliptic_orbit" title="Elliptic orbit">elliptic orbit</a> around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at <a href="/wiki/Apsis" title="Apsis">perihelion</a> and moving slower when it is farther away at <a href="/wiki/Apsis" title="Apsis">aphelion</a>.</p>
<p>One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <a href="/wiki/Philosopher" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="/wiki/Anaxagoras" title="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a>, who reasoned that it is a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnese" title="Peloponnese">Peloponnesus</a> rather than the <a href="/wiki/Chariot" title="Chariot">chariot</a> of <a href="/wiki/Helios" title="Helios">Helios</a>, and that the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> reflected the light of the Sun. For teaching this <a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">heresy</a>, he was imprisoned by the authorities and <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital punishment">sentenced to death</a>, though he was later released through the intervention of <a href="/wiki/Pericles" title="Pericles">Pericles</a>. <a href="/wiki/Eratosthenes" title="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the 3rd century BC as "of stadia <a href="/wiki/Myriad" title="Myriad">myriads</a> 400 and 80000", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 <a href="/wiki/Stadion_(unit)" title="Stadion (unit)">stadia</a> (755,000 km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the 1st century AD, <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> estimated the distance as 1,210 times <a href="/wiki/Earth_radius" title="Earth radius">the radius of Earth</a>, approximately 7.71 million kilometers (0.0515 AU).</p>
<p>The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek <a href="/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos" title="Aristarchus of Samos">Aristarchus of Samos</a> in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by <a href="/wiki/Seleucus_of_Seleucia" title="Seleucus of Seleucia">Seleucus of Seleucia</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Heliocentrism" title="Heliocentrism">Heliocentrism</a>).

<p>Observations of sunspots were recorded during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Han_Dynasty" title="Han Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> (206 BC–AD 220) by <a href="/wiki/Chinese_astronomy" title="Chinese astronomy">Chinese astronomers</a>, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. <a href="/wiki/Averroes" title="Averroes">Averroes</a> also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.

In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lord_Kelvin" title="Lord Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat. Kelvin and <a href="/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz" title="Hermann von Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> then proposed a <a href="/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_mechanism" title="Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism">gravitational contraction</a> mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time. In 1890 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Norman_Lockyer" title="Joseph Norman Lockyer">Joseph Lockyer</a>, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.</p>

In 1920, Sir <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Eddington" title="Arthur Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass. The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by <a href="/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin" title="Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin">Cecilia Payne</a> using the <a href="/wiki/Ionization" title="Ionization">ionization</a> theory developed by <a href="/wiki/Meghnad_Saha" title="Meghnad Saha">Meghnad Saha</a>, an Indian physicist.

Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of <a href="/wiki/Comet" title="Comet">comets</a>, mostly tiny <a href="/wiki/Sungrazing_comet" title="Sungrazing comet">sungrazing comets</a> that incinerate as they pass the Sun.</p>

<p>All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ulysses_probe" title="Ulysses probe">Ulysses probe</a> was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, to "slingshot" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_ray" title="Cosmic ray">cosmic rays</a>.</p>
<p>Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy" title="Astronomical spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a> sample return mission, <a href="/wiki/Genesis_(spacecraft)" title="Genesis (spacecraft)">Genesis</a>, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/STEREO" title="STEREO">Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory</a> (STEREO) mission was launched in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind Earth. This enables <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stereoscopic" title="Stereoscopic">stereoscopic</a> imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejections" title="Coronal mass ejections">coronal mass ejections</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Indian_Space_Research_Organisation" title="Indian Space Research Organisation">Indian Space Research Organisation</a> has scheduled the launch of a 100 kg satellite named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aditya_(spacecraft)" title="Aditya (spacecraft)">Aditya</a> for 2017–18. Its main instrument will be a <a href="/wiki/Coronagraph" title="Coronagraph">coronagraph</a> for studying the dynamics of the Solar corona.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Observation_and_effects">Observation and effects</span></h2>


<p>The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the <a href="/wiki/Naked_eye" title="Naked eye">naked eye</a>; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes <a href="/wiki/Phosphene" title="Phosphene">phosphene</a> visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">UV</a> exposure gradually yellows the lens of the eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cataracts" title="Cataracts">cataracts</a>, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.</p>
<p>Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating <a href="/wiki/Optics" title="Optics">optics</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Binoculars" title="Binoculars">binoculars</a> may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or <a href="/wiki/Infrared" title="Infrared">IR</a> rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels. <a href="/wiki/Herschel_wedge" title="Herschel wedge">Herschel wedges</a>, also called Solar Diagonals, are effective and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>Partial <a href="/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipses</a> are hazardous to view because the eye's <a href="/wiki/Pupil" title="Pupil">pupil</a> is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view, <i>not</i> by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same <a href="/wiki/Surface_brightness" title="Surface brightness">surface brightness</a> as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2 mm to ~6 mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.</p>

<p>During <a href="/wiki/Sunrise" title="Sunrise">sunrise</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sunset" title="Sunset">sunset</a>, sunlight is attenuated because of <a href="/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" title="Rayleigh scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mie_theory" title="Mie theory">Mie scattering</a> from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.</p>
<p>An <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optical_phenomenon" title="Optical phenomenon">optical phenomenon</a>, known as a <a href="/wiki/Green_flash" title="Green flash">green flash</a>, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being <a href="/wiki/Refraction" title="Refraction">bent</a> (usually through a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperature_inversion" title="Temperature inversion">temperature inversion</a>) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is <a href="/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" title="Rayleigh scattering">scattered</a> more, leaving light that is perceived as green.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a> light from the Sun has <a href="/wiki/Antiseptic" title="Antiseptic">antiseptic</a> properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. It also causes <a href="/wiki/Sunburn" title="Sunburn">sunburn</a>, and has other biological effects such as the production of <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_D" title="Vitamin D">vitamin D</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sun_tanning" title="Sun tanning">sun tanning</a>. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a> and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in <a href="/wiki/Human_skin_color" title="Human skin color">human skin color</a> in different regions of the globe.</p>
