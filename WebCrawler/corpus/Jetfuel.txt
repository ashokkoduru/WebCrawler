<p><b>Jet fuel</b>, <b>aviation turbine fuel</b> (<b>ATF</b>), or <b>avtur</b>, is a type of <a href="/wiki/Aviation_fuel" title="Aviation fuel">aviation fuel</a> designed for use in <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> powered by <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">gas-turbine engines</a>. It is colorless to straw-colored in appearance. The most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A-1, which are produced to a standardized international specification. The only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is Jet B, which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance.</p>
<p>Jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a>. The range of their sizes (molecular weights or carbon numbers) is defined by the requirements for the product, such as the freezing or smoke point. <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">Kerosene</a>-type jet fuel (including Jet A and Jet A-1) has a <a href="/wiki/Carbon_number" title="Carbon number">carbon number</a> distribution between about 8 and 16 (carbon atoms per molecule); wide-cut or <a href="/wiki/Naphtha" title="Naphtha">naphtha</a>-type jet fuel (including Jet B), between about 5 and 15.</p>

<p>Fuel for <a href="/wiki/Reciprocating_engine" title="Reciprocating engine">piston-engine</a> powered aircraft (usually a high-<a href="/wiki/Octane_rating" title="Octane rating">octane</a> <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Avgas" title="Avgas">avgas</a>) has a low <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash point</a> to improve its ignition characteristics. Turbine engines can operate with a wide range of fuels, and jet-aircraft engines typically use fuels with higher <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash points</a>, which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle.</p>

Gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption. Other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures. Most jet fuels in use since the end of World War II are kerosene-based. Both British and American standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of World War II. British standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lamps—known as paraffin in the UK—whereas American standards derived from aviation gasoline practices. Over the subsequent years, details of specifications were adjusted, such as minimum freezing point, to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels. Very low temperature <a href="/wiki/Melting_point" title="Melting point">freezing points</a> reduce the availability of fuel. Higher <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash point</a> products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce. In the United States, <a href="/wiki/ASTM_International" title="ASTM International">ASTM International</a> produces standards for civilian fuel types, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> produces standards for military use. The <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)">British Ministry of Defence</a> establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels. For reasons of inter-operational ability, British and United States military standards are harmonized to a degree. In Russia and former Soviet Union countries, grades of jet fuels are covered by the State Standard (GOST) number, or a Technical Condition number, with the principal grade available in Russia and members of the CIS being TS-1.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jet_A">Jet A</span></h3>



<p>Jet A specification fuel has been used in the United States since the 1950s and is usually not available outside the United States and a few Canadian airports such as <a href="/wiki/Toronto_Pearson_International_Airport" title="Toronto Pearson International Airport">Toronto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vancouver_International_Airport" title="Vancouver International Airport">Vancouver</a>, whereas Jet A-1 is the standard specification fuel used in the rest of the world other than the former Soviet states where TS-1 is the most common standard. Both Jet A and Jet A-1 have a <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash point</a> higher than 38 °C (100 °F), with an <a href="/wiki/Autoignition_temperature" title="Autoignition temperature">autoignition temperature</a> of 210 °C (410 °F).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_Jet_A_and_Jet_A-1">Differences between Jet A and Jet A-1</span></h3>
<p>The primary difference is the lower freezing point of A-1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jet A's is −40 °C (−40 °F)</li>
<li>Jet A-1's is −47 °C (−53 °F)</li>
</ul>
<p>The other difference is the mandatory addition of an anti-static additive to Jet A-1.</p>
<p>Jet A trucks, storage tanks, and plumbing that carry Jet A are marked with a black sticker with "Jet A" in white printed on it, adjacent to another black stripe.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jet_B">Jet B</span></h3>
<p>Jet B is a fuel in the naphtha-kerosene region that is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance. However, Jet B's lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle. For this reason, it is rarely used, except in very cold climates. A blend of approximately 30% kerosene and 70% gasoline, it is known as wide-cut fuel. It has a very low freezing point of −60 °C (−76 °F), and a low <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash point</a> as well. It is primarily used in some military aircraft. It is also used in Canada, Alaska, and sometimes Russia, because of its low freezing point.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Additives">Additives</span></h2>
<p>The DEF STAN 91-91 (UK) and ASTM D1655 (international) specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel, including:</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Biocide" title="Biocide">Biocides</a> are to remediate microbial (i.e., bacterial and fungal) growth present in aircraft fuel systems. Currently, two biocides are approved for use by most aircraft and turbine engine <a href="/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer" title="Original equipment manufacturer">original equipment manufacturers</a> (OEMs); Kathon FP1.5 Microbiocide and Biobor JF.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Metal_deactivator" title="Metal deactivator">Metal deactivator</a> can be added to remediate the deleterious effects of trace metals on the thermal stability of the fuel. The one allowable additive is <a href="/wiki/1,2-Diaminopropane#metaldeactivating" title="1,2-Diaminopropane">N,N’-disalicylidene 1,2-propanediamine</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the aviation industry’s jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5% of all refined products derived from crude, it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene, a high value product, by varying process techniques. New processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes, the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the manufacture of synthetic blend stocks. Due to the number and severity of the processes used, it is often necessary and sometimes mandatory to use additives. These additives may, for example, prevent the formation of harmful chemical species or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_in_jet_fuel">Water in jet fuel</span></h2>
<p>It is very important that jet fuel be free from water <a href="/wiki/Contamination" title="Contamination">contamination</a>. During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">atmosphere</a>. This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel. The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °C. If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes. This was the cause of the <a href="/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_38" title="British Airways Flight 38">British Airways Flight 38</a> accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing.</p>
<p>There are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel. A visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water, as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance. An industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm (parts per million) free water. A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Military_jet_fuels">Military jet fuels</span></h2>

<p>Military organizations around the world use a different classification system of JP (for "Jet Propellant") numbers. Some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives; Jet A-1 is similar to <a href="/wiki/JP-8" title="JP-8">JP-8</a>, Jet B is similar to <a href="/wiki/JP-4_(fuel)" title="JP-4 (fuel)">JP-4</a>. Other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications.</p>
<p>Jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphtha-type. Kerosene-type fuels include Jet A, Jet A-1, JP-5 and JP-8. Naphtha-type jet fuels, sometimes referred to as "wide-cut" jet fuel, include Jet B and JP-4.</p>




<p>The JP-4 and JP-5 fuels, covered by the MIL-DTL-5624 and meeting the British Specification DEF STAN 91-86 AVCAT/<a href="/wiki/Fuel_system_icing_inhibitor" title="Fuel system icing inhibitor">FSII</a> (formerly DERD 2452), are intended for use in aircraft <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">turbine engines</a>. These fuels require military-unique additives that are necessary in military <a href="/wiki/Weapon_system" title="Weapon system">weapon systems</a>, engines, and missions.</p>








<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Piston_engine_use">Piston engine use</span></h2>

<p>Jet fuel is very similar to <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel fuel</a>, and in some cases, may be burned in <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engines</a>. The possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of <a href="/wiki/Tetraethyllead" title="Tetraethyllead">leaded</a> avgas, and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance, has left aircraft designers and pilot's organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft. As a result, a few aircraft engine manufacturers, most notably <a href="/wiki/Thielert" title="Thielert">Thielert</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austro_Engine" title="Austro Engine">Austro Engine</a>, have begun offering <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_diesel_engine" title="Aircraft diesel engine">aircraft diesel engines</a> which run on jet fuel. This technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required. Jet fuel is available in most places in the world, whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of <a href="/wiki/General_aviation" title="General aviation">general aviation</a> aircraft. A diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine. However, very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities. Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today, even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the <a href="/wiki/Junkers_Jumo_205" title="Junkers Jumo 205">Junkers Jumo 205</a> family had been used during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Jet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports, instead of diesel. The United States military makes heavy use of JP-8, for instance. However, jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel, thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine parts. Civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use, or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its <a href="/wiki/Lubricity" title="Lubricity">lubricity</a>. Jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Jet fuel contains more sulfur, up to 1,000 ppm, which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require. The introduction of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers. Pipeline diesels before ULSD were able to contain up to 500 ppm of sulfur and was called Low Sulfur Diesel or LSD. LSD is now only available to the off-road construction, locative and marine markets. As more EPA regulations are introduced, more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production, thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel, as determined by ASTM Standard D445.</p>

The USAF has a stated goal of certifying its entire fleet for use with FT synthetic fuel blends by 2011. The CAAFI initiative aims to certify the civilian aviation fleet for FT synthetic fuels blends by 2010, and has programs under way to certify Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) (aka Hydrogenated Renewable Jet (HRJ)) SPK biofuels as early as 2013. "Hydroprocessed" and "hydrotreated" have also been used in lieu of "hydrogenated". Both FT and HEFA based SPKs blended with JP-8 are specified in MIL-DTL-83133H.</p>
<p>Synthetic jet fuels show a reduction in pollutants such as SOx, NOx, particulate matter, and hydrocarbon emissions. It is envisaged that usage of synthetic jet fuels will increase air quality around airports which will be particularly advantageous at inner city airports.</p>
