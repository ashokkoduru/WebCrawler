<p><b>Propulsion</b> is a means of creating force leading to <a href="/wiki/Motion_(physics)" title="Motion (physics)">movement</a>. The term is derived from two Latin words: <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pro" title="wikt:pro">pro</a></i>, meaning <i>before</i> or <i>forward</i>; and <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pellere" title="wikt:pellere">pellere</a></i>, meaning <i>to drive</i>. A <b>propulsion system</b> consists of a source of mechanical power, and a <i>propulsor</i> (means of converting this power into propulsive force).</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technological</a> system uses an <a href="/wiki/Engine" title="Engine">engine or motor</a> as the power source, and <a href="/wiki/Wheel_and_axle" title="Wheel and axle">wheels and axles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Propeller" title="Propeller">propellers</a>, or a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propulsive_nozzle" title="Propulsive nozzle">propulsive nozzle</a> to generate the force. Components such as <a href="/wiki/Clutch" title="Clutch">clutches</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gearbox" title="Gearbox">gearboxes</a> may be needed to connect the motor to axles, wheels, or propellors.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">Biological</a> propulsion systems use an animal's muscles as the power source, and limbs such as <a href="/wiki/Wing" title="Wing">wings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fin" title="Fin">fins</a> or <a href="/wiki/Leg" title="Leg">legs</a> as the propulsors.</p>

<p>An aircraft propulsion system generally consists of an <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_engine" title="Aircraft engine">aircraft engine</a> and some means to generate thrust, such as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propeller_(aircraft)" title="Propeller (aircraft)">propeller</a> or a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propulsive_nozzle" title="Propulsive nozzle">propulsive nozzle</a>.</p>
<p>An aircraft propulsion system must achieve two things. First, the thrust from the propulsion system must balance the drag of the airplane when the airplane is cruising. And second, the thrust from the propulsion system must exceed the drag of the airplane for the airplane to accelerate. In fact, the greater the difference between the thrust and the drag, called the excess thrust, the faster the airplane will accelerate.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>, like airliners and cargo planes, spend most of their life in a cruise condition. For these airplanes, excess thrust is not as important as high engine efficiency and low fuel usage. Since thrust depends on both the amount of gas moved and the velocity, we can generate high thrust by accelerating a large mass of gas by a small amount, or by accelerating a small mass of gas by a large amount. Because of the aerodynamic efficiency of propellers and fans, it is more fuel efficient to accelerate a large mass by a small amount. That is why we find high bypass fans and turboprops on cargo planes and airliners.</p>
<p>Some aircraft, like fighter planes or experimental high speed aircraft, require very high excess thrust to accelerate quickly and to overcome the high drag associated with high speeds. For these airplanes, engine efficiency is not as important as very high thrust. Modern military aircraft typically employ afterburners on a low bypass turbofan core. Future hypersonic aircraft will employ some type of ramjet or rocket propulsion.</p>

<p>Ground propulsion is any mechanism for propelling solid bodies along the ground, usually for the purposes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transportation" title="Transportation">transportation</a>. The propulsion system often consists of a combination of an <a href="/wiki/Engine" title="Engine">engine or motor</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gearbox" title="Gearbox">gearbox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wheel_and_axle" title="Wheel and axle">wheel and axles</a> in standard applications.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Maglev" title="Maglev">Maglev</a></div>
<p>Maglev (derived from <b>mag</b>netic <b>lev</b>itation) is a system of transportation that uses <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_levitation" title="Magnetic levitation">magnetic levitation</a> to suspend, guide and propel vehicles with magnets rather than using mechanical methods, such as <a href="/wiki/Wheel_and_axle" title="Wheel and axle">wheels, axles and bearings</a>. With maglev a vehicle is levitated a short distance away from a guide way using magnets to create both lift and thrust. Maglev vehicles are claimed to move more smoothly and quietly and to require less maintenance than wheeled <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mass_transit" title="Mass transit">mass transit</a> systems. It is claimed that non-reliance on friction also means that acceleration and deceleration can far surpass that of existing forms of transport. The power needed for levitation is not a particularly large percentage of the overall energy consumption; most of the power used is needed to overcome air resistance (<a href="/wiki/Drag_(physics)" title="Drag (physics)">drag</a>), as with any other high-speed form of transport.</p>

<p>Marine propulsion is the mechanism or system used to generate <a href="/wiki/Thrust" title="Thrust">thrust</a> to move a <a href="/wiki/Ship" title="Ship">ship</a> or <a href="/wiki/Boat" title="Boat">boat</a> across water. While <a href="/wiki/Paddle" title="Paddle">paddles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sail" title="Sail">sails</a> are still used on some smaller boats, most modern ships are propelled by mechanical systems consisting a motor or engine turning a <a href="/wiki/Propeller" title="Propeller">propeller</a>, or less frequently, in jet drives, an <a href="/wiki/Impeller" title="Impeller">impeller</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Space">Space</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion" title="Spacecraft propulsion">Spacecraft propulsion</a></div>
<p>Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a> and artificial <a href="/wiki/Satellite" title="Satellite">satellites</a>. There are many different methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a <a href="/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle" title="Rocket engine nozzle">supersonic de Laval nozzle</a>. This sort of <a href="/wiki/Engine" title="Engine">engine</a> is called a <a href="/wiki/Rocket_engine" title="Rocket engine">rocket engine</a>.</p>
<p>All current spacecraft use chemical rockets (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bipropellant_rocket" title="Bipropellant rocket">bipropellant</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solid_rocket" title="Solid rocket">solid-fuel</a>) for launch, though some (such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pegasus_rocket" title="Pegasus rocket">Pegasus rocket</a> and <a href="/wiki/SpaceShipOne" title="SpaceShipOne">SpaceShipOne</a>) have used <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air-breathing_engine" title="Air-breathing engine">air-breathing engines</a> on their <a href="/wiki/Multistage_rocket" title="Multistage rocket">first stage</a>. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often <a href="/wiki/Monopropellant_rocket" title="Monopropellant rocket">monopropellant rockets</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Resistojet_rocket" title="Resistojet rocket">resistojet rockets</a> for <a href="/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping" title="Orbital station-keeping">orbital station-keeping</a> and some use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Momentum_wheel" title="Momentum wheel">momentum wheels</a> for <a href="/wiki/Attitude_control" title="Attitude control">attitude control</a>. Soviet bloc satellites have used <a href="/wiki/Electrically_powered_spacecraft_propulsion" title="Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion">electric propulsion</a> for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used <a href="/wiki/Ion_thruster" title="Ion thruster">ion thrusters</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hall_effect_thruster" title="Hall effect thruster">Hall effect thrusters</a> (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.</p>

<p>A cable car is any of a variety of transportation systems relying on cables to pull vehicles along or lower them at a steady rate. The terminology also refers to the vehicles on these systems. The cable car vehicles are motor-less and engine-less and they are pulled by a cable that is rotated by a motor off-board.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Animal">Animal</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Animal_locomotion" title="Animal locomotion">Animal locomotion</a></div>

<p>Animal locomotion, which is the act of self-propulsion by an animal, has many manifestations, including <a href="/wiki/Running" title="Running">running</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aquatic_locomotion" title="Aquatic locomotion">swimming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jumping" title="Jumping">jumping</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flying_and_gliding_animals" title="Flying and gliding animals">flying</a>. Animals move for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, or a suitable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microhabitat" title="Microhabitat">microhabitat</a>, and to escape predators. For many animals the ability to move is essential to survival and, as a result, selective pressures have shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms employed by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the <a href="/wiki/Arctic_tern" title="Arctic tern">Arctic tern</a>) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators (such as <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a>) are likely to have costly but very fast locomotion. The study of animal locomotion is typically considered to be a sub-field of <a href="/wiki/Biomechanics" title="Biomechanics">biomechanics</a>.</p>
<p>Locomotion requires <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> to overcome <a href="/wiki/Friction" title="Friction">friction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drag_(physics)" title="Drag (physics)">drag</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inertia" title="Inertia">inertia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, though in many circumstances some of these factors are negligible. In <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_planet" title="Terrestrial planet">terrestrial</a> environments gravity must be overcome, though the drag of air is much less of an issue. In aqueous environments however, friction (or drag) becomes the major challenge, with gravity being less of a concern. Although animals with natural <a href="/wiki/Buoyancy" title="Buoyancy">buoyancy</a> need not expend much energy maintaining vertical position, some will naturally sink and must expend energy to remain afloat. Drag may also present a problem in <a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">flight</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aerodynamic" title="Aerodynamic">aerodynamically</a> efficient body shapes of <a href="/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> highlight this point. Flight presents a different problem from movement in water however, as there is no way for a living organism to have lower <a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a> than air. Limbless organisms moving on land must often contend with surface friction, but do not usually need to expend significant energy to counteract gravity.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newton's third law of motion</a> is widely used in the study of animal locomotion: if at rest, to move forwards an animal must push something backwards. Terrestrial animals must push the solid ground, swimming and flying animals must push against a <a href="/wiki/Fluid" title="Fluid">fluid</a> or <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gas</a> (either <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a>). The effect of forces during locomotion on the design of the skeletal system is also important, as is the interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement.</p>
