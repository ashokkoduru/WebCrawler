<p><b>Aintree Motor Racing Circuit</b> is a 3-mile (4.83 km) motor racing circuit in the village of <a href="/wiki/Aintree" title="Aintree">Aintree</a>, <a href="/wiki/Merseyside" title="Merseyside">Merseyside</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. The circuit is located within the famous <a href="/wiki/Aintree_Racecourse" title="Aintree Racecourse">Aintree Racecourse</a> and used the same grandstands as horse racing. Built in 1954 as the "<a href="/wiki/Goodwood_Circuit" title="Goodwood Circuit">Goodwood</a> of the North", hence the fact the two venues had so many things in common. The track is well surfaced and relatively flat - ranging from 15 to about 30 metres in elevation.</p>
<p>The circuit has hosted the <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> <a href="/wiki/British_Grand_Prix" title="British Grand Prix">British Grand Prix</a> five times, in <a href="/wiki/1955_British_Grand_Prix" title="1955 British Grand Prix">1955</a>, <a href="/wiki/1957_British_Grand_Prix" title="1957 British Grand Prix">1957</a>, <a href="/wiki/1959_British_Grand_Prix" title="1959 British Grand Prix">1959</a>, <a href="/wiki/1961_British_Grand_Prix" title="1961 British Grand Prix">1961</a> and <a href="/wiki/1962_British_Grand_Prix" title="1962 British Grand Prix">1962</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the Grands Prix, the circuit also held 11 non-championship Formula 1 races, known as the Aintree 200, first won by Stirling Moss in 1954 with the last winner being <a href="/wiki/Jack_Brabham" title="Jack Brabham">Jack Brabham</a>, in April 1964 (Brabham had made his Formula One debut at the circuit in the 1955 British GP). Aintree was the location for the famous race in 1955 in which <a href="/wiki/Stirling_Moss" title="Stirling Moss">Stirling Moss</a> won his first <a href="/wiki/British_Grand_Prix" title="British Grand Prix">British Grand Prix</a>, driving a Mercedes.

The 1957 Grand Prix also took the title of Grand Prix de Europe and was the premier Formula 1 event of the season, attracting 150 000 spectators.</p>
<p>The full Grand Prix circuit was last raced on in 1964, but part of it (the 1.535-mile (2.47 km) Club Circuit) is still open and was used for racing until the early 1980s, having been operated by the Aintree Circuit Club <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aintree.org.uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> from the mid-1960s to the late 1990s. In the 1980s the 108 Car Club (<a href="/wiki/St_Helens,_Merseyside" title="St Helens, Merseyside">St. Helens</a>) brought rallying back to Aintree Circuit revitalising the circuits use with new and innovative ideas. A limited amount of motor sport continues today in the form of car sprints, track days and motorcycle racing on the Club Circuit.</p>
<p>The Motorcycle events are organised by Aintree Motor Cycle Racing Club <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.AintreeMotorcycleRacingClub" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, who run 6 events at Aintree each year.</p>
<p>The Car events are orgainsed by Liverpool Motor Club <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpoolmotorclub.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> in the form of three sprints, in April, June and September and two trackdays in May and October on the club circuit.
