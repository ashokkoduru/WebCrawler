<p>The racing circuit began life as the perimeter track of <a href="/wiki/RAF_Westhampnett" title="RAF Westhampnett">RAF Westhampnett</a> airfield, which was constructed during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> as a relief airfield for <a href="/wiki/RAF_Tangmere" title="RAF Tangmere">RAF Tangmere</a>. The first race meeting took place on 18 September 1948, organised by the <a href="/wiki/British_Automobile_Racing_Club" title="British Automobile Racing Club">Junior Car Club</a> and sanctioned by the <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Gordon-Lennox,_9th_Duke_of_Richmond" title="Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond">Duke of Richmond and Gordon</a>. The winner of the first race was P. de F. C. Pycroft, in his 2,664 c.c. Pycroft-Jaguar, at 66.42 m.p.h. <a href="/wiki/Stirling_Moss" title="Stirling Moss">Stirling Moss</a> won the 500cc race (later to become <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Formula_3" title="Formula 3">Formula 3</a>), followed by <a href="/wiki/Eric_Brandon" title="Eric Brandon">Eric Brandon</a> and "Curly" Dryden, all in <a href="/wiki/Cooper_Car_Company" title="Cooper Car Company">Coopers</a>.</p>

<p>Goodwood became famous for its <a href="/wiki/Glover_Trophy" title="Glover Trophy">Glover Trophy</a> non-championship <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> race, Goodwood Nine Hours sports car endurance races run in 1952, 1953 and 1955, and the <a href="/wiki/RAC_Tourist_Trophy" title="RAC Tourist Trophy">Tourist Trophy</a> sports car race, run here 1958-1964.

<p>Goodwood has, over the years, played host to many famous drivers: <a href="/wiki/Mike_Hawthorn" title="Mike Hawthorn">Mike Hawthorn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Graham_Hill" title="Graham Hill">Graham Hill</a> had their first single seat races there, <a href="/wiki/Roger_Penske" title="Roger Penske">Roger Penske</a> visited in 1963, and <a href="/wiki/Jim_Clark" title="Jim Clark">Jim Clark</a> and Jack Sears competed in 1964. The accident that ended <a href="/wiki/Stirling_Moss" title="Stirling Moss">Stirling Moss</a>'s International career happened at St. Mary's Corner in 1962.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Donald_Campbell" title="Donald Campbell">Donald Campbell</a> demonstrated his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bluebird_CN7" title="Bluebird CN7">Bluebird CN7</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Land_Speed_Record" title="Land Speed Record">Land Speed Record</a> car at Goodwood in July 1960 at its initial public launch, and again in July 1962, before being shipped to Australia—where it finally broke the record in 1964. The car was a 30-foot-long (9.1 m) <a href="/wiki/Bristol_Siddeley" title="Bristol Siddeley">Bristol Siddeley</a> turbine-powered 4,500 hp (3,400 kW) streamliner, with a theoretical top speed of 450 to 500 miles per hour (720 to 800 km/h). The laps of Goodwood were effectively at "tick-over" speed, because the car had only four degrees of steering lock, with a maximum of 100 mph (160 km/h) on the straight on one lap.</p>
<p>Goodwood saw its last race meeting for over 30 years in 1966, because the owners did not want to modify the track with <a href="/wiki/Chicane" title="Chicane">chicanes</a> to control the increased speeds of modern racing cars. The last event was a club meeting organised by the <a href="/wiki/British_Automobile_Racing_Club" title="British Automobile Racing Club">British Automobile Racing Club</a> on 2 July 1966.</p>

<p>The accident happened on Lavant Straight, when a rear bodywork failure on McLaren's M8D car caused it to spin and leave the track, hitting a structure on the infield at over 100 mph while travelling sideways.</p>

<p>Following the success of the Festival of Speed hill climb, racing returned to the Goodwood circuit in 1998. The Goodwood Revival is a three-day festival held each September for the types of cars and motorcycles that would have competed during the circuit's original period, 1948–1966. Historic aircraft help to complete the vintage feel. In 2008, a crowd of 68,000 people attended the event on the main Sunday - 9,000 more than in 2007. The track is now used for classic races, track days, and try-out days. Nearly everyone dresses up in vintage outfit from mods and rockers to racing drivers and just smart period clothes.</p>
