<p>The <b>sociology of knowledge</b> is the study of the relationship between human <a href="/wiki/Thought" title="Thought">thought</a> and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. It is not a specialized area of <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> but instead deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individuals' lives and the social-cultural basics of our <a href="/wiki/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> about the world. Complementary to the sociology of knowledge is the sociology of ignorance, including the study of nescience, ignorance, knowledge gaps, or non-knowledge as inherent features of knowledge making.</p>
<p>The sociology of knowledge was pioneered primarily by the sociologist <a href="/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> at beginning of the 20th century. His work deals directly with how conceptual thought, language, and logic could be influenced by the sociological milieu out of which they arise. In an early work co-written with <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Mauss" title="Marcel Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a>, <i>Primitive Classification</i>, Durkheim and Mauss take a study of "primitive" group mythology to argue that systems of classification are collectively based and that the divisions with these systems are derived from social categories. Later, Durkheim in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Elementary_Forms_of_the_Religious_Life" title="The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life">The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</a></i> would elaborate his theory of knowledge, examining how language and the concepts and categories (such as space and time) used in logical thought have a sociological origin. While neither Durkheim, nor Mauss, specifically coined nor used the term 'sociology of knowledge', their work is an important first contribution to the field.</p>
<p>The specific term 'sociology of knowledge' is said to have been in widespread use since the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociologists</a>, most notably <a href="/wiki/Max_Scheler" title="Max Scheler">Max Scheler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mannheim" title="Karl Mannheim">Karl Mannheim</a>, wrote extensively on sociological aspects of knowledge. With the dominance of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Functionalism_(sociology)" title="Functionalism (sociology)">functionalism</a> through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by <a href="/wiki/Peter_L._Berger" title="Peter L. Berger">Peter L. Berger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Luckmann" title="Thomas Luckmann">Thomas Luckmann</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality" title="The Social Construction of Reality">The Social Construction of Reality</a></i> (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socially_constructed_reality" title="Socially constructed reality">socially constructed reality</a></i>). The 'genealogical' and 'archaeological' studies of <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> are of considerable contemporary influence.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Enlightenment">The Enlightenment</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">The Enlightenment</a> movement ought not to be underestimated in its influence upon the social sciences. When these philosophers worked towards a scientific analysis of society, they were engaged in a sociology of ideas and values, albeit their own commitment was to critical rationalism. The Enlightenment strove for progress, change, <a href="/wiki/Secularism" title="Secularism">secularism</a>, but above all, to freedom, the freedom for individuals to decide their own fate. There was a commitment to practical science with humankind at the centre (as opposed to God or gods) and this is the real source of social science. This new science was not interested in revealed knowledge or <i>a priori</i> knowledge but in the workings of humanity: human practices, and social variety and regularities. Western thought, therefore, received a significant movement towards cultural relativism, where cross-cultural comparison became the dominant methodology. Importantly, social science was created by philosophers who sought to turn ideas into actions and to unite theory and practice in an attempt to restructure society as a whole.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Earlier_viewpoints">Earlier viewpoints</span></h3>
<p>Sociology of knowledge requires a certain viewpoint which was first expounded by <a href="/wiki/Giambattista_Vico" title="Giambattista Vico">Giambattista Vico</a> in his <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Science" title="The New Science">New Science</a></i>, written in the early 18th Century, a great deal before the first sociologists study the relationship between knowledge and society. In this book, a justification for a new historical and sociological methodology, the main point is that the natural world and the social world are known in different ways. The former is known through external or empirical methods, whilst the latter can be known internally as well as externally. In other words, human history is a construct. This creates a key epistemological distinction between the natural world and the social world which is a central concept in the social sciences. Primarily focused on <a href="/wiki/Historicism" title="Historicism">historical methodology</a>, Vico asserts that in order to study a society's history it is necessary to move beyond a chronicle of events by examining the cultural elements of the society, what was termed the "civil world". This "civil world", made up of actions, thoughts, ideas, myths, norms, religious beliefs, and institutions, is the product of the human mind. Since these elements are socially constructed, they can be better understood than the physical world, understood as it is in abstraction. Vico highlights that human nature and its products are not fixed entities and therefore necessitate an historical perspective which emphasizes the changes and developments implicit in individuals and societies. He also emphasizes the dialectical relationship between society and culture as key in this new historical perspective.</p>
<p>Vico's ideas, whilst permeated by his own penchant for etymology, and a theory of cyclical history (<i>corsi e ricorsi),</i> are significant nonetheless for the underlying premise that our understanding and knowledge of social structure is dependent upon the ideas and concepts we employ and the language used. Vico, mostly unknown in his own time, was the first to establish the foundations of a sociology of knowledge even if his concepts were not necessarily picked up by later writers. There is some evidence that <a href="/wiki/Montesquieu" title="Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> had read Vico's work. However the similarities in their works are superficial, limited mainly to the overall conception of their projects, characterised by cultural relativisim and historicism.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id=".C3.89mile_Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> (1858–1917) is credited as having been the first professor to successfully establish the field of sociology, institutionalizing a department of sociology at the Université de Bordeaux in the 1890s. While his works deal with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.</p>
<p>While publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay <i>De quelques formes primitives de classification</i> written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Elementary_Forms_of_Religious_Life" title="The Elementary Forms of Religious Life">The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</a></i>. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A_priori_knowledge" title="A priori knowledge">a priori</a></i>. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a>, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabula rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal <i>a priori</i> truths (as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kant" title="Kant">Kant</a> argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.</p>
<p>Another key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of <i>représentations collectives</i> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Collective_representations" title="Collective representations">collective representations</a>), which is outlined in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Elementary_Forms_of_the_Religious_Life" title="The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life">The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</a></i>. <i>Représentations collectives</i> are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, <i>représentations collectives</i> are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).</p>
<p>Arguably the most important "représentation collective" is <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a>, which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'représentations collectives', and language in particular, :</p>

<p>As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality, an idea developed by later French philosophers, such as <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Karl_Mannheim">Karl Mannheim</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mannheim" title="Karl Mannheim">Karl Mannheim</a></div>
<p>The German political philosophers <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> (1818–1883) and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> (1820–1895) argued in <i>Die deutsche Ideologie</i> (1846, <i>German Ideology</i>) and elsewhere that people's <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideologies</a>, including their social and political beliefs and opinions, are rooted in their <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a> interests, and more broadly in the social and economic circumstances in which they live:</p>

<p>Under the influence of this doctrine, and of <a href="/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)" title="Phenomenology (philosophy)">Phenomenology</a>, the Hungarian-born German sociologist <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mannheim" title="Karl Mannheim">Karl Mannheim</a> (1893–1947) gave impetus to the growth of the sociology of knowledge with his <i>Ideologie und Utopie</i> (1929, translated and extended in 1936 as <i>Ideology and Utopia</i>), although the term had been introduced five years earlier by the co-founder of the movement, the German philosopher, phenomenologist and social theorist <a href="/wiki/Max_Scheler" title="Max Scheler">Max Scheler</a> (1874–1928), in <i>Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens</i> (1924, <i>Attempts at a Sociology of Knowledge</i>).</p>
<p>Mannheim feared that this interpretation could be seen to claim that all knowledge and beliefs are the products of socio-political forces since this form of <a href="/wiki/Relativism" title="Relativism">relativism</a> is self-defeating (if it is true, then it too is merely a product of socio-political forces and has no claim to truth and no persuasive force). Mannheim believed that <a href="/wiki/Relativism" title="Relativism">relativism</a> was a strange mixture of modern and ancient beliefs in that it contained within itself a belief in an absolute truth which was true for all times and places (the ancient view most often associated with <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>) and condemned other truth claims because they could not achieve this level of objectivity (an idea gleaned from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marx" title="Marx">Marx</a>). Mannheim sought to escape this problem with the idea of 'relationism'. This is the idea that certain things are true only in certain times and places (a view influenced by <a href="/wiki/Pragmatism" title="Pragmatism">pragmatism</a>) however, this does not make them less true. Mannheim felt that a stratum of free-floating intellectuals (who he claimed were only loosely anchored to the class structure of society) could most perfectly realize this form of truth by creating a "dynamic synthesis" of the ideologies of other groups.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Phenomenological_sociology">Phenomenological sociology</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Phenomenological_sociology" title="Phenomenological sociology">Phenomenological sociology</a> is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The "object" of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the "Lebenswelt", or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life-world" title="Life-world">life-world</a> (Husserl:1889). The task, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to describe the formal structures of this object of investigation in subjective terms, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness (Gurwitsch:1964). That which makes such a description different from the "naive" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional, positivist social scientist, is the utilization of phenomenological methods.</p>
<p>The leading proponent of phenomenological sociology was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alfred_Schutz" title="Alfred Schutz">Alfred Schütz</a> (1899–1959). Schütz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>'s interpretive sociology through the use of phenomenological methods derived from the transcendental phenomenological investigations of <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Husserl" title="Edmund Husserl">Edmund Husserl</a> (1859–1938). Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional <a href="/wiki/Consciousness" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a>. Schütz's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of the Life-world (Schütz:1980). Husserl's work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Schütz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the Life-world (Natanson:1974). The difference in their research projects lies at the level of analysis, the objects taken as topics of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the two projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the Life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity and <a href="/wiki/Truth_value" title="Truth value">truth value</a> (Sokolowski:2000).</p>
<p>The phenomenological tie-in with the sociology of knowledge stems from two key historical sources for <a href="/wiki/Mannheim" title="Mannheim">Mannheim</a>'s analysis: [1] Mannheim was dependent on insights derived from Husserl's phenomenological investigations, especially the theory of meaning as found in Husserl's Logical Investigations of 1900/1901 (Husserl:2000), in the formulation of his central methodological work: "On The Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (Mannheim:1993:see fn41 &amp; fn43) – this essay forms the centerpiece for Mannheim's method of historical understanding and is central to his conception of the sociology of knowledge as a research program; and [2] The concept of "Weltanschauung" employed by Mannheim has its origins in the hermeneutic philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, who relied on Husserl's theory of meaning (above) for his methodological specification of the interpretive act (Mannheim: 1993: see fn38).</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Husserl's analysis of the formal structures of consciousness, and Schütz's analysis of the formal structures of the Life-world are specifically intended to establish the foundations, in consciousness, for the understanding and interpretation of a social world which is subject to cultural and historical change. The phenomenological position is that although the <a href="/wiki/Facticity" title="Facticity">facticity</a> of the social world may be culturally and historically relative, the formal structures of consciousness, and the processes by which we come to know and understand this facticity, are not. That is, the understanding of any actual social world is unavoidably dependent on understanding the structures and processes of consciousness that found, and constitute, any possible social world.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the facticity of the social world <i>and</i> the structures of consciousness prove to be culturally and historically relative, then we are at an impasse in regard to any meaningful scientific understanding of the social world which is not subjective (as opposed to being objective and grounded in nature [positivism], or inter subjective and grounded in the structures of consciousness [phenomenology]), and relative to the cultural and idealization formations of particular concrete individuals living in a particular socio-historical group.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Michel_Foucault">Michel Foucault</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a></div>
<p>A particularly important contemporary contribution to the sociology of knowledge is found in the work of Michel Foucault. <i><a href="/wiki/Madness_and_Civilization" title="Madness and Civilization">Madness and Civilization</a></i> (1961) postulated that conceptions of madness and what was considered "reason" or "knowledge" was itself subject to major <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Culture_bias" title="Culture bias">culture bias</a> - in this respect mirroring similar criticisms by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Szasz" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a>, at the time the foremost critic of <a href="/wiki/Psychiatry" title="Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, and himself now an eminent psychiatrist. A point where Foucault and Szasz agreed was that sociological processes played the major role in defining "madness" as an "illness" and prescribing "cures". In <i>The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception</i> (1963), Foucault extended his critique to institutional clinical medicine, arguing for the central <a href="/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor" title="Conceptual metaphor">conceptual metaphor</a> of "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medical_gaze" title="Medical gaze">The Gaze</a>", which had implications for <a href="/wiki/Medical_education" title="Medical education">medical education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prison#Prison_design_and_facilities" title="Prison">prison design</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carceral_state" title="Carceral state">carceral state</a> as understood today. Concepts of <a href="/wiki/Criminal_justice" title="Criminal justice">criminal justice</a> and its intersection with medicine were better developed in this work than in Szasz and others, who confined their critique to current psychiatric practice. <i>The Order of Things</i> (1966) and <i>The Archeology of Knowledge</i> (1969) introduced abstract notions of mathesis and taxonomia to explain the subjective 'ordering' of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_sciences" title="Human sciences">human sciences</a>. These, he claimed, had transformed 17th and 18th century studies of "general grammar" into modern "<a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">natural history</a>" into modern "<a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a>", and "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Analysis_of_wealth" title="Analysis of wealth">analysis of wealth</a>" into modern "<a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>"; though not, claimed Foucault, without loss of meaning. According to Foucault, the 19th century transformed what knowledge was.</p>
<p>Perhaps Foucault's best-known claim was that "Man did not exist" before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of <a href="/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">humanism</a> as inventions of <a href="/wiki/Modernity" title="Modernity">modernity</a>. Accordingly, a <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_bias" title="Cognitive bias">cognitive bias</a> had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist's ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nietzsche" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> - that philosopher declaring the "death of God" in the 19th century, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-humanism" title="Anti-humanism">anti-humanists</a> proposing the "death of Man" in the 20th.</p>
<p>In <i>Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison</i>, Foucault concentrates on the correlation between <a href="/wiki/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and power. According to him, knowledge is a form of power and can conversely be used against individuals as a form of power. As a result, knowledge is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socially_constructed" title="Socially constructed">socially constructed</a>. He argues that knowledge forms discourses and discourses form the dominant ideological ways of thinking which govern our lives. For him, social control is maintained in ‘the disciplinary society’, through codes of control over sexuality and the ideas/knowledge perpetuated through social institutions. In other words, discourses and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ideologies" title="Ideologies">ideologies</a> subject us to authority and turn people into ‘subjected beings’, who are in turn afraid of being punished if they sway from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_norms" title="Social norms">social norms</a>. Foucault believes that institutions overtly regulate and control our lives. Institutions such as schools reinforce the dominant ideological forms of thinking onto the populace and force us into becoming obedient and docile beings. Hence, the <a href="/wiki/Dominant_ideology" title="Dominant ideology">dominant ideology</a> that serves the interests of the ruling class, all the while appearing as `neutral`, needs to be questioned and must not go unchallenged.</p>
