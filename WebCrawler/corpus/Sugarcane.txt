<p><b>Sugarcane</b>, or <b>sugar cane</b>, is one (<i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum_officinarum" title="Saccharum officinarum">Saccharum officinarum</a></i>) of the several species of tall <a href="/wiki/Perennial_plant" title="Perennial plant">perennial</a> <a href="/wiki/Poaceae" title="Poaceae">true grasses</a> of the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum" title="Saccharum">Saccharum</a></i>, tribe <a href="/wiki/Andropogoneae" title="Andropogoneae">Andropogoneae</a>, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Melanesia" title="Melanesia">Melanesia</a>, and used for <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> <a href="/wiki/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, which accumulates in the <a href="/wiki/Plant_stem" title="Plant stem">stalk internodes</a>. The plant is 2 to 6 m (6 ft 7 in to 19 ft 8 in) tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> are complex <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrids</a>. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and <a href="/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, and many <a href="/wiki/Forage" title="Forage">forage</a> crops.</p>
<p>Sucrose, extracted and purified in specialized mill factories, is used as raw material in human food industries or is fermented to produce <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>. Ethanol is produced on a large scale by the Brazilian sugarcane industry. Sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity. In 2012, The <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> estimates it was cultivated on about 26<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 hectares (6.4<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 acres), in more than 90 countries, with a worldwide harvest of 1.83<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 tonnes (1.80<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 long tons; 2.02<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 short tons). Brazil was the largest producer of sugar cane in the world. The next five major producers, in decreasing amounts of production, were India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Mexico.</p>
<p>The world demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture. Cane accounts for 80% of sugar produced; most of the rest is made from <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beets</a>. Sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions (sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions). Other than sugar, products derived from sugarcane include <a href="/wiki/Falernum" title="Falernum">falernum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rum" title="Rum">rum</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Cacha%C3%A7a" title="Cachaça">cachaça</a></i> (a traditional spirit from Brazil), <a href="/wiki/Bagasse" title="Bagasse">bagasse</a>, and ethanol. In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch. The young, unexpanded <a href="/wiki/Inflorescence" title="Inflorescence">inflorescence</a> of <i>tebu telor</i> is eaten raw, steamed, or toasted, and prepared in various ways in certain island communities of Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the famous "reeds that produce honey without bees" in India between the 6th and 4th centuries BC. They adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture. Merchants began to trade in sugar from India, which was considered a luxury and an expensive spice. In the 18th century AD, sugarcane plantations began in Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean and Pacific island nations and the need for laborers became a major driver of large human migrations, including <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slave labor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indenture" title="Indenture">indentured servants</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Sugarcane is a tropical, perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems, typically three to four m (10 to 13 ft) high and about 5 cm (2 in) in diameter. The stems grow into cane stalk, which when mature constitutes around 75% of the entire plant. A mature stalk is typically composed of 11–16% fiber, 12–16% soluble sugars, 2–3% nonsugars, and 63–73% water. A sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate, soil type, irrigation, fertilizers, insects, disease control, varieties, and the harvest period. The average yield of cane stalk is 60–70 tonnes per hectare (24–28 long ton/acre; 27–31 short ton/acre) per year. However, this figure can vary between 30 and 180 tonnes per hectare depending on knowledge and crop management approach used in sugarcane cultivation. Sugarcane is a <a href="/wiki/Cash_crop" title="Cash crop">cash crop</a>, but it is also used as livestock fodder.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/History_of_sugar" title="History of sugar">History of sugar</a></div>

<p>Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South</a> and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Different species likely originated in different locations, with <i><a href="/wiki/Saccharum_barberi" title="Saccharum barberi">Saccharum barberi</a></i> originating in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> and <i>S. edule</i> and <i>S. officinarum</i> in <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>. It is theorized that sugarcane was first domesticated as a crop in New Guinea around 6000 BC. New Guinean farmers and other early cultivators of sugarcane chewed the plant for its sweet juice. Early farmers in Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, may have also boiled the cane juice down to a viscous mass to facilitate transportation, but the earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern India. The exact date of the first cane sugar production is unclear. The earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts.</p>
<p>Around the 8th century, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> traders introduced sugar from <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> to the other parts of the <a href="/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate" title="Abbasid Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Andalusia" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. By the 10th century, sources state that no village in <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> did not grow sugarcane. It was among the early crops brought to the Americas by the Spanish, mainly Andalusians, from their fields in the <a href="/wiki/Canary_Islands" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> from their fields in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Madeira_Islands" title="Madeira Islands">Madeira Islands</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> first brought sugarcane to the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> during his second voyage to the <a href="/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>; initially to the island of <a href="/wiki/Hispaniola" title="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> (modern day <a href="/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>). In colonial times, sugar formed one side of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triangle_trade" title="Triangle trade">triangle trade</a> of New World raw materials, along with European manufactured goods, and African <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slaves</a>. Sugar (often in the form of molasses) was shipped from the Caribbean to Europe or New England, where it was used to make rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were then used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> found its sugarcane islands so valuable that it effectively traded its <a href="/wiki/New_France" title="New France">portion of Canada</a>, famously dubbed "<a href="/wiki/A_few_acres_of_snow" title="A few acres of snow">a few acres of snow</a>", to Britain for their return of <a href="/wiki/Guadeloupe" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Martinique" title="Martinique">Martinique</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Lucia" title="Saint Lucia">St. Lucia</a> at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> similarly kept <a href="/wiki/Suriname" title="Suriname">Suriname</a>, a sugar colony in <a href="/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, instead of seeking the return of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_Netherlands" title="New Netherlands">New Netherlands</a> (New York).</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boiling_house" title="Boiling house">Boiling houses</a> in the 17th through 19th centuries converted <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane_juice" title="Sugarcane juice">sugarcane juice</a> into raw sugar. These houses were attached to sugar plantations in the Western colonies. Slaves often ran the boiling process under very poor conditions. Rectangular boxes of brick or stone served as furnaces, with an opening at the bottom to stoke the fire and remove ashes. At the top of each furnace were up to seven copper kettles or boilers, each one smaller and hotter than the previous one. The cane juice began in the largest kettle. The juice was then heated and lime added to remove impurities. The juice was skimmed and then channeled to successively smaller kettles. The last kettle, the "teache", was where the cane juice became syrup. The next step was a cooling trough, where the sugar crystals hardened around a sticky core of molasses. This raw sugar was then shoveled from the cooling trough into <a href="/wiki/Hogshead" title="Hogshead">hogsheads</a> (wooden barrels), and from there into the curing house.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, slaves were liberated after 1833 and many would no longer work on sugarcane plantations when they had a choice. British owners of sugarcane plantations therefore needed new workers, and they found cheap labour in China, Portugal and India. The people were subject to <a href="/wiki/Indentured_servant" title="Indentured servant">indenture</a>, a long-established form of contract which bound them to forced labour for a fixed term; apart from the fixed term of servitude, this resembled slavery. The first ships carrying indentured labourers from India left in 1836. The migrations to serve sugarcane plantations led to a significant number of ethnic Indians, southeast Asians and Chinese settling in various parts of the world. In some islands and countries, the <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asian</a> migrants now constitute between 10 to 50 percent of the population. Sugarcane plantations and Asian ethnic groups continue to thrive in countries such as <a href="/wiki/Fiji" title="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colony_of_Natal" title="Colony of Natal">Natal</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Burma" title="Burma">Burma</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/wiki/British_Guiana" title="British Guiana">British Guiana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Martinique" title="Martinique">Martinique</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_Guiana" title="French Guiana">French Guiana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guadeloupe" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grenada" title="Grenada">Grenada</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Lucia" title="St. Lucia">St. Lucia</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saint_Vincent_(island)" title="Saint Vincent (island)">St. Vincent</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Kitts" title="St. Kitts">St. Kitts</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Croix" title="St. Croix">St. Croix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Suriname" title="Suriname">Suriname</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nevis" title="Nevis">Nevis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>.</p>

<p>The then British colony of <a href="/wiki/Queensland" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, now a state of <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, imported between 55,000 and 62,500 (estimates vary) people from the South <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Islands" title="Pacific Islands">Pacific Islands</a> to work on sugarcane plantations between 1863 and 1900.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> sugar derived from sugarcane was exported to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>, where it received price supports and was ensured a guaranteed market. The <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Dissolution of the Soviet Union">1991 dissolution of the Soviet state</a> forced the closure of most of Cuba's sugar industry.</p>
<p>Sugarcane remains an important part of the economy of <a href="/wiki/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belize" title="Belize">Belize</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barbados" title="Barbados">Barbados</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, along with the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guadeloupe" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, and other islands.</p>
<p>About 70% of the sugar produced globally comes from <i>S. officinarum</i> and hybrids using this species.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultivation">Cultivation</span></h2>

<p>Sugarcane cultivation requires a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical">tropical</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate, with a minimum of 60 cm (24 in) of annual moisture. It is one of the most <a href="/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency" title="Photosynthetic efficiency">efficient</a> <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesizers</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plant_kingdom" title="Plant kingdom">plant kingdom</a>. It is a <a href="/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation" title="C4 carbon fixation">C<sub>4</sub> plant</a>, able to convert up to 1% of incident solar energy into biomass. In prime growing regions, such as <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, sugarcane crops can produce over 15 kg/m of cane. Once a major crop of the southeastern region of the United States, sugarcane cultivation has declined there in recent decades, and is now primarily confined to <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Cane_Growers_Cooperative_of_Florida" title="Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.</p>
<p>Sugarcane is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics in areas with a plentiful supply of water, for a continuous period of more than 6-7 months each year, either from natural rainfall or through irrigation. The crop does not tolerate severe frosts. Therefore, most of the world's sugarcane is grown between <a href="/wiki/22nd_parallel_north" title="22nd parallel north">22°N</a> and <a href="/wiki/22nd_parallel_south" title="22nd parallel south">22°S</a>, and some up to <a href="/wiki/33rd_parallel_north" title="33rd parallel north">33°N</a> and <a href="/wiki/33rd_parallel_south" title="33rd parallel south">33°S</a>. When sugarcane crop is found outside this range, such as the <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal" title="KwaZulu-Natal">Natal</a> region of South Africa, it is normally due to anomalous climatic conditions in the region, such as warm ocean currents that sweep down the coast. In terms of altitude, sugarcane crop is found up to 1,600 m close to the equator in countries such as <a href="/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>.</p>
<p>Sugarcane can be grown on many soils ranging from highly fertile well-drained <a href="/wiki/Mollisol" title="Mollisol">mollisols</a>, through heavy cracking <a href="/wiki/Vertisol" title="Vertisol">vertisols</a>, infertile acid <a href="/wiki/Oxisol" title="Oxisol">oxisols</a>, peaty <a href="/wiki/Histosol" title="Histosol">histosols</a>, to rocky <a href="/wiki/Andisol" title="Andisol">andisols</a>. Both plentiful sunshine and water supplies increase cane production. This has made desert countries with good irrigation facilities such as Egypt some of the highest-yielding sugarcane-cultivating regions.</p>

<p>Although sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting has become the most common reproduction method. Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Billet_planting&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Billet planting (page does not exist)">billet planting</a> is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ratoon" title="Ratoon">ratoons</a>. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made depending on the type of culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/La_R%C3%A9union" title="La Réunion">la Réunion</a>, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.</p>


<p>Sugarcane is harvested by hand and mechanically. Hand harvesting accounts for more than half of production, and is dominant in the developing world. In hand harvesting, the field is first set on fire. The fire burns dry leaves, and chases away or kills any lurking venomous snakes, without harming the stalks and roots. Harvesters then cut the cane just above ground-level using <a href="/wiki/Cane_knife" title="Cane knife">cane knives</a> or <a href="/wiki/Machete" title="Machete">machetes</a>. A skilled harvester can cut 500 kg (1,100 lb) of sugarcane per hour.</p>
<p>Mechanical harvesting uses a <a href="/wiki/Combine_harvester" title="Combine harvester">combine</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane_harvester" title="Sugarcane harvester">sugarcane harvester</a>. The Austoft 7000 series, the original modern harvester design, has now been copied by other companies, including Cameco / <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deere_%26_Company" title="Deere &amp; Company">John Deere</a>. The machine cuts the cane at the base of the stalk, strips the leaves, chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside. The harvester then blows the trash back onto the field. Such machines can harvest 100 long tons (100 t) each hour; however, harvested cane must be rapidly processed. Once cut, sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content, and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline. This decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than hand cutting and loading. Austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to, for example, the nearest railway siding. This mechanical harvesting doesn't require the field to be set on fire; the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves, which act as mulch for the next round of planting.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conditions_for_sugarcane_workers">Conditions for sugarcane workers</span></h3>
<p>At least 20,000 people are estimated to have died of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Central America in the past two decades – most of them sugar cane workers along the Pacific coast. This may be due to working long hours in the heat without adequate fluid intake.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Processing">Processing</span></h2>
<p>Traditionally, sugarcane processing requires two stages. Mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane and "mill-white” sugar is sometimes produced immediately after the first stage at sugar-extraction mills, intended for local consumption. Sugar crystals appear naturally in white color during the crystallization process. Sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules as well as to stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation. Refineries, often located nearer to consumers in North America, Europe, and Japan, then produce refined white sugar, which is 99 percent sucrose. These two stages are slowly merging. Increasing affluence in the sugar-producing tropics increased demand for refined sugar products, driving a trend toward combined milling and refining.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Milling">Milling</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sugar_cane_mill" title="Sugar cane mill">Sugar cane mill</a></div>



<p>Sugarcane processing produces <b>cane sugar</b> (sucrose) from sugarcane. Other products of the processing include bagasse, molasses, and filtercake.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bagasse" title="Bagasse">Bagasse</a>, the residual dry fiber of the cane after cane juice has been extracted, is used for several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fuel for the boilers and kilns,</li>
<li>production of paper, paperboard products, and reconstituted panelboard,</li>
<li>agricultural mulch, and</li>
<li>as a raw material for production of chemicals.</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary use of bagasse and bagasse residue is as a fuel source for the boilers in the generation of process steam in sugar plants. Dried filtercake is used as an animal feed supplement, fertilizer, and source of sugarcane wax.</p>
<p>Molasses is produced in two forms: <a href="/wiki/Molasses#Blackstrap_Molasses" title="Molasses">Blackstrap</a>, which has a characteristic strong flavor, and a purer <a href="/wiki/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a> syrup.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Refining">Refining</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Sugar_refinery" title="Sugar refinery">Sugar refining</a> further purifies the raw sugar. It is first mixed with heavy syrup and then centrifuged in a process called "affination". Its purpose is to wash away the sugar crystals' outer coating, which is less pure than the crystal interior. The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup, about 60 percent solids by weight.</p>
<p>The sugar solution is clarified by the addition of <a href="/wiki/Phosphoric_acid" title="Phosphoric acid">phosphoric acid</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide" title="Calcium hydroxide">calcium hydroxide</a>, which combine to precipitate <a href="/wiki/Calcium_phosphate" title="Calcium phosphate">calcium phosphate</a>. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float to the top of the tank, where they can be skimmed off. An alternative to this "phosphatation" technique is "<a href="/wiki/Carbonatation" title="Carbonatation">carbonatation</a>", which is similar, but uses <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and calcium hydroxide to produce a <a href="/wiki/Calcium_carbonate" title="Calcium carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> precipitate.</p>
<p>After filtering any remaining solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through <a href="/wiki/Activated_carbon" title="Activated carbon">activated carbon</a>. <a href="/wiki/Bone_char" title="Bone char">Bone char</a> or coal-based <a href="/wiki/Activated_carbon" title="Activated carbon">activated carbon</a> is traditionally used in this role. Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/White_refined_sugar" title="White refined sugar">white refined sugar</a>. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging. Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again crystallizing to produce <a href="/wiki/Brown_sugar" title="Brown sugar">brown sugar</a>. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the final molasses still contains 20–30 percent sucrose and 15–25 percent glucose and fructose.</p>
<p>To produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Granulated_sugar" title="Granulated sugar">granulated sugar</a>, in which individual grains do not clump, sugar must be dried, first by heating in a rotary dryer, and then by blowing cool air through it for several days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ribbon_cane_syrup">Ribbon cane syrup</span></h3>
<p>Ribbon cane is a subtropical type that was once widely grown in the southern United States, as far north as coastal <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>. The juice was extracted with horse or mule-powered crushers; the juice was boiled, like <a href="/wiki/Maple_syrup" title="Maple syrup">maple syrup</a>, in a flat pan, and then used in the syrup form as a food sweetener. It is not currently a commercial crop, but a few growers find ready sales for their product.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pollution_from_sugarcane_processing">Pollution from sugarcane processing</span></h3>
<p>Particulate matter, combustion products, and volatile organic compounds are the primary pollutants emitted during the sugarcane processing. Combustion products include nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), CO<sub>2</sub>, and sulfur oxides (SO<sub>X</sub>). Potential emission sources include the sugar granulators, sugar conveying and packaging equipment, bulk loadout operations, boilers, granular carbon and char regeneration kilns, regenerated adsorbent transport systems, kilns and handling equipment (at some facilities), carbonation tanks, multi-effect evaporator stations, and vacuum boiling pans. Modern pollution prevention technologies are capable of addressing all of these potential pollutants.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>

<p>Brazil led the world in sugarcane production in 2013 with a 739 267 TMT harvest. India was the second largest producer with 341 200 TMT tons, and China the third largest producer with 125 536 TMT tons harvest.</p>
<p>The average worldwide yield of sugarcane crops in 2013 was 70.77 tons per hectare. The most productive farms in the world were in <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> with a nationwide average sugarcane crop yield of 133.71 tons per hectare.</p>
<p>The theoretical possible yield for sugar cane, according to 1983 study of Duke, is about 280 metric tons per hectare per year, and small experimental plots in Brazil have demonstrated yields of 236–280 metric tons of fresh cane per hectare. The most promising region for high yield sugarcane production were in sun drenched, irrigated farms of northern Africa, and other deserts with plentiful water from river or irrigation canals.</p>
<p>In the United States, sugarcane is grown commercially in <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>.</p>
<p>Brazil uses sugarcane to produce sugar and <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> for gasoline-ethanol blends (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gasohol" title="Gasohol">gasohol</a>), a locally popular transportation <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a>. In <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, sugarcane is used to produce sugar, <a href="/wiki/Jaggery" title="Jaggery">jaggery</a> and alcoholic beverages.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cane_ethanol">Cane ethanol</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">Ethanol fuel</a></div>

<p>Ethanol is generally available as a byproduct of sugar production. It can be used as a <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a> alternative to gasoline, and is widely used in cars in Brazil. It is an alternative to gasoline, and may become the primary product of sugarcane processing, rather than sugar.</p>
<p>In Brazil, gasoline is required to contain at least 22 percent bioethanol. This bioethanol is sourced from Brazil's large sugarcane crop.</p>
<p>The production of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse is used to produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.</p>
<p>A textbook on renewable energy describes the energy transformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presently, 75 tons of raw sugar cane are produced annually per hectare in Brazil. The cane delivered to the processing plant is called burned and cropped (b&amp;c), and represents 77% of the mass of the raw cane. The reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves (which are burned and whose ashes are left in the field as fertilizer), and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop. Average cane production is, therefore, 58 tons of b&amp;c per hectare per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each ton of b&amp;c yields 740 kg of juice (135 kg of sucrose and 605 kg of water) and 260 kg of moist bagasse (130 kg of dry bagasse). Since the lower heating value of sucrose is 16.5 M<a href="/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">J</a>/kg, and that of the bagasse is 19.2 MJ/kg, the total heating value of a ton of b&amp;c is 4.7 GJ of which 2.2 GJ come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the bagasse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Per hectare per year, the biomass produced corresponds to 0.27 TJ. This is equivalent to 0.86 W per square meter. Assuming an average insolation of 225 W per square meter, the photosynthetic efficiency of sugar cane is 0.38%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 135 kg of sucrose found in 1 ton of b&amp;c are transformed into 70 litres of ethanol with a combustion energy of 1.7 GJ. The practical sucrose-ethanol conversion efficiency is, therefore, 76% (compare with the theoretical 97%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One hectare of sugar cane yields 4,000 litres of ethanol per year (without any additional energy input, because the bagasse produced exceeds the amount needed to distill the final product). This, however, does not include the energy used in tilling, transportation, and so on. Thus, the solar energy-to-ethanol conversion efficiency is 0.13%.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bagasse_applications">Bagasse applications</span></h2>
<p>Sugarcane is a major crop in many countries. It is one of the plants with the highest bioconversion efficiency. Sugarcane crop is able to efficiently fix solar energy, yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually. After harvest, the crop produces sugar juice and bagasse, the fibrous dry matter. This dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production. Bagasse can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production.</p>
<p>Sugarcane bagasse is a potentially abundant source of energy for large producers of sugarcane, such as Brazil, India and China. According to one report, with use of latest technologies, bagasse produced annually in Brazil has the potential of meeting 20 percent of Brazil’s energy consumption by 2020.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electricity_production">Electricity production</span></h3>
<p>A number of countries, in particular those devoid of any fossil fuel, have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize energy used in cane processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid. Bagasse is usually burned to produce steam, which in turn creates electricity. Current technologies, such as those in use in <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, produce over 100 kWh of electricity per tonne of bagasse. With a total world harvest of over 1 billion tonnes of sugar cane per year, the global energy potential from bagasse is over 100,000 GWh. Using Mauritius as a reference, an annual potential of 10,000 GWh of additional electricity could be produced throughout <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Electrical generation from bagasse could become quite important, particularly to the rural populations of sugarcane producing nations.</p>
<p>Recent cogeneration technology plants are being designed to produce from 200 to over 300 kWh of electricity per tonne of bagasse. As sugarcane is a seasonal crop, shortly after harvest the supply of bagasse would peak, requiring power generation plants to strategically manage the storage of bagasse.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biogas_production">Biogas production</span></h3>
<p>A greener alternative to burning bagasse for the production of electricity is to convert bagasse into <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a>. Technologies are being developed to use <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> to transform bagasse into advanced <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a> and biogas.</p>
