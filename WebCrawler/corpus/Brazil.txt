<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Name_of_Brazil" title="Name of Brazil">Name of Brazil</a></div>
<p>It is likely that the word "Brazil" comes from the Portuguese word for <a href="/wiki/Caesalpinia_echinata" title="Caesalpinia echinata">brazilwood</a>, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast. In Portuguese, brazilwood is called <i>pau-brasil</i>, with the word <i>brasil</i> commonly given the etymology "red like an ember", formed from Latin <i>brasa</i> ("ember") and the suffix <i>-il</i> (from <i>-iculum</i> or <i>-ilium</i>). As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil. Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil" title="Indigenous peoples in Brazil">indigenous peoples</a> (mostly <a href="/wiki/Tupi_people" title="Tupi people">Tupi</a>) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.</p>
<p>The official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the "Land of the Holy Cross" (<i>Terra da Santa Cruz</i>), but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the "Land of Brazil" (<i>Terra do Brasil</i>) on account of the brazilwood trade. The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Early sailors sometimes also called it the "Land of Parrots" (<i>Terra di Papaga</i>).</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Guarani_language" title="Guarani language">Guarani language</a>, an official language of <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, Brazil is called "Pindorama". This was the name the indigenous population gave to the region, meaning "land of the palm trees".</p>

<p>The earliest human remains found in the <a href="/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luzia_Woman" title="Luzia Woman">Luzia Woman</a>, were found in the area of <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Leopoldo" title="Pedro Leopoldo">Pedro Leopoldo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minas_Gerais" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years. The earliest <a href="/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">pottery</a> ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_basin" title="Amazon basin">Amazon basin</a> of Brazil and <a href="/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating" title="Radiocarbon dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near <a href="/wiki/Santar%C3%A9m,_Par%C3%A1" title="Santarém, Pará">Santarém</a> and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people, mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The indigenous population of Brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g. the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tup%C3%AD_people" title="Tupí people">Tupis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people" title="Guaraní people">Guaranis</a>, <a href="/wiki/G%C3%AA_peoples" title="Gê peoples">Gês</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arawak_peoples" title="Arawak peoples">Arawaks</a>). The Tupí people were subdivided into the <a href="/wiki/Tupiniquim_people" title="Tupiniquim people">Tupiniquins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tupinamb%C3%A1_people" title="Tupinambá people">Tupinambás</a>, and there were also many subdivision of the other groups.</p>
<p>Before the arrival of Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs. These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism" title="Cannibalism">cannibalistic</a> rituals on <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" title="Prisoner of war">prisoners of war</a>. While heredity had some weight, leadership status was more subdued over time, than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions. <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">Slavery</a> among the Indians had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into <a href="/wiki/Kinship" title="Kinship">kinship</a> relations.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Portuguese_colonization">Portuguese colonization</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Brazil" title="Colonial Brazil">Colonial Brazil</a></div>

<p>The land now called Brazil was claimed for the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Empire" title="Portuguese Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by <a href="/wiki/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral" title="Pedro Álvares Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a>. The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tupi%E2%80%93Guarani" title="Tupi–Guarani">Tupi–Guarani</a> family, and fought among themselves. Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively begun in 1534, when King <a href="/wiki/Dom_(title)" title="Dom (title)">Dom</a> <a href="/wiki/John_III_of_Portugal" title="John III of Portugal">João III</a> of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous <a href="/wiki/Captaincies_of_Brazil" title="Captaincies of Brazil">Captaincy Colonies of Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>However, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the <a href="/wiki/Governorate_General_of_Brazil" title="Governorate General of Brazil">Governorate General of Brazil</a>, a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America. In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opportunistic" title="Opportunistic">opportunistic</a> alliances in order to gain advantages against each other. By the mid-16th century, <a href="/wiki/Sugar#Sugarcane" title="Sugar">cane sugar</a> had become Brazil's most important exportation product, and slaves purchased in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa#Atlantic_slave_trade" title="Slavery in Africa">slave market of Western Africa</a> (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Angola" title="Portuguese Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Mozambique" title="Portuguese Mozambique">Mozambique</a>), had become its largest import, to cope with <a href="/wiki/Plantation_economy" title="Plantation economy">plantations</a> of sugarcane, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.</p>

<p>By the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline, and the discovery of gold by <a href="/wiki/Bandeirantes" title="Bandeirantes">bandeirantes</a> in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Gold_Rush" title="Brazilian Gold Rush">Brazilian Gold Rush</a> which attracted thousands of new <a href="/wiki/Settler_colonialism" title="Settler colonialism">settlers</a> to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world. This increased level of immigration in turn caused <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Emboabas" title="War of the Emboabas">some conflicts</a> between newcomers and old settlers.</p>
<p>Portuguese expeditions known as <a href="/wiki/Bandeirantes" title="Bandeirantes">Bandeiras</a> gradually advanced the Portugal colonial <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Tordesillas" title="Treaty of Tordesillas">original frontiers</a> in South America to approximately the current Brazilian borders. In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French <a href="/wiki/France_Antarctique" title="France Antarctique">in Rio during the 1560s</a>, <a href="/wiki/Equinoctial_France" title="Equinoctial France">in Maranhão during the 1610s</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Brazil" title="Dutch Brazil">Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Dutch%E2%80%93Portuguese_War" title="Dutch–Portuguese War">Dutch–Portuguese War</a>, after the end of <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Union" title="Iberian Union">Iberian Union</a>.</p>
<p>The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of <a href="/wiki/Slave_rebellion" title="Slave rebellion">slave rebellion</a> and resistance, such as the <a href="/wiki/Palmares_(quilombo)" title="Palmares (quilombo)">Quilombo of Palmares</a>, and to repress all movements for <a href="/wiki/Autonomous_administrative_division" title="Autonomous administrative division">autonomy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Independence" title="Independence">independence</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Inconfid%C3%AAncia_Mineira" title="Inconfidência Mineira">Minas Conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of <a href="/wiki/Continental_Portugal" title="Continental Portugal">continental Portugal</a>, causing <a href="/wiki/John_VI_of_Portugal" title="John VI of Portugal">Prince Regent João</a>, in the name of <a href="/wiki/Maria_I_of_Portugal" title="Maria I of Portugal">Queen Maria I</a>, to move the royal court from <a href="/wiki/Lisbon" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> to <a href="/wiki/Transfer_of_the_Portuguese_Court_to_Brazil" title="Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil">Brazil</a>. There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local <a href="/wiki/Stock_exchange" title="Stock exchange">stock exchanges</a>, and its <a href="/wiki/Banco_do_Brasil" title="Banco do Brasil">National Bank</a>, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_conquest_of_French_Guiana" title="Portuguese conquest of French Guiana">Portuguese conquest of French Guiana</a>.</p>
<p>With the end of the <a href="/wiki/Peninsular_War" title="Peninsular War">Peninsular War</a> in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Portugal,_Brazil,_and_the_Algarves" title="United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves">United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves</a>, thus creating a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pluricontinental" title="Pluricontinental">pluricontinental</a> transatlantic monarchic state. However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Revolution_of_1820" title="Liberal Revolution of 1820">Liberal Revolution of 1820</a>), as well as groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic, as showed by the <a href="/wiki/Pernambucan_Revolt" title="Pernambucan Revolt">1817 Pernambucan Revolt</a>. In 1821, as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of <a href="/wiki/Porto" title="Porto">Porto</a>, D. João VI was unable to hold out any longer, and departed for Lisbon. There he swore oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, <a href="/wiki/Pedro_I_of_Brazil" title="Pedro I of Brazil">Prince Pedro de Alcântara</a>, as Regent of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Brazil" title="Kingdom of Brazil">Kingdom of Brazil</a>.</p>

<p>Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Cortes" title="Portuguese Cortes">Portuguese Cortes</a>, guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony. The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_Declaration_of_Independence" title="Brazilian Declaration of Independence">declaring the country's independence from Portugal</a> on 7 September 1822. A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the regnal title of Dom <a href="/wiki/Pedro_I_of_Brazil" title="Pedro I of Brazil">Pedro I</a>, resulting in the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Brazil" title="Empire of Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_War_of_Independence" title="Brazilian War of Independence">Brazilian War of Independence</a>, which had already begun along this process, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province. With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824, Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<br/>
On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of <a href="/wiki/Confederation_of_the_Equator" title="Confederation of the Equator">republican secession</a>, as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in Portugal had given to the succession of King John VI, Pedro I went to Portugal to <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Wars" title="Liberal Wars">reclaim his daughter's crown</a>, abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (who thus became the Empire's second monarch, with the regnal title of Dom <a href="/wiki/Pedro_II_of_Brazil" title="Pedro II of Brazil">Pedro II</a>).</p>

<p>As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regency_(government)" title="Regency (government)">regency</a> was set up by the National Assembly. In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, as the <a href="/wiki/Cabanagem" title="Cabanagem">Cabanagem</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mal%C3%AA_Revolt" title="Malê Revolt">Malê Revolt</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Balaiada" title="Balaiada">Balaiada</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sabinada" title="Sabinada">Sabinada</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Ragamuffin_War" title="Ragamuffin War">Ragamuffin War</a>, which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast, slaveholding and newly independent <a href="/wiki/Nation_state" title="Nation state">nation state</a>. This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Praieira_revolt" title="Praieira revolt">Praieira revolt</a>, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dom_Pedro_II#Early_coronation" title="Dom Pedro II">premature coronation of Pedro II</a> in 1841.</p>
<p>During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery. The <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> was abandoned in 1850, as a result of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen_Act" title="Aberdeen Act">Aberdeen Act</a>, but only in <a href="/wiki/Lei_%C3%81urea" title="Lei Áurea">May 1888</a> after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_Brazil" title="Slavery in Brazil">slavery in the country</a>, was the institution formally abolished.</p>
<p>The foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Cone" title="Southern Cone">Southern Cone</a> with which Brazil has borders. Long after the <a href="/wiki/Cisplatine_War" title="Cisplatine War">Cisplatine War</a> that resulted in independence for <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II.

<p>On 15 November 1889, worn out by years of economic stagnation, in attrition with the majority of Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.</p>

<p>The "early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship, with army dominating affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power". In 1894, following the unfoldings of two severe crises, <a href="/wiki/Encilhamento" title="Encilhamento">an economic</a> along with <a href="/wiki/Revolta_da_Armada" title="Revolta da Armada">a military one</a>, the republican civilians rose to power.</p>
<p>Little by little, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rebellions_and_revolutions_in_Brazil#1st_Republican_period_.281889-1930.29" title="Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil">a cycle of general instability</a> sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent, that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate <a href="/wiki/Get%C3%BAlio_Vargas" title="Getúlio Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a> supported by most of the military, successfully led the <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Revolution_of_1930" title="Brazilian Revolution of 1930">Brazilian Revolution of 1930</a>. Vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.</p>

<p>In the 1930s, three major attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred. The first was the failed <a href="/wiki/Constitutionalist_Revolution" title="Constitutionalist Revolution">Constitutionalist Revolution</a> of 1932, the second was the anti-fascist <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_uprising_of_1935" title="Brazilian uprising of 1935">Brazilian uprising of 1935</a> led by communists, and the fascist <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Integralism" title="Brazilian Integralism">Integralist Movement</a> attempted a coup in May 1938. The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the Congress transferred more power to the executive. The 1937 <i>coup d'état</i> resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election, installed Vargas as a dictator, and began the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Estado_Novo_(Brazil)" title="Estado Novo (Brazil)">Estado Novo</a> era, noted for government brutality and censorship of the press.</p>
<p>In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period, was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Brazil_during_World_War_I" title="Brazil during World War I">its involvement</a> in <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>.

<p>With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with Democracy being "reinstated" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.</p>

<p>Several brief interim governments succeeded after Vargas's suicide. <a href="/wiki/Juscelino_Kubitschek" title="Juscelino Kubitschek">Juscelino Kubitschek</a> became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the <a href="/wiki/Opposition_(politics)" title="Opposition (politics)">political opposition</a> that allowed him to govern without major crises. The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of <a href="/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia" title="Brasília">Brasília</a>, inaugurated in 1960. His successor was <a href="/wiki/J%C3%A2nio_Quadros" title="Jânio Quadros">Jânio Quadros</a>, who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office. His vice-president, <a href="/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Goulart" title="João Goulart">João Goulart</a>, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was <a href="/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="1964 Brazilian coup d'état">deposed in April 1964 by a coup</a> that resulted in a <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_military_government" title="Brazilian military government">military regime</a>.</p>
<p>The new regime was intended to be transitory but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968. The oppression was not limited to only those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society, inside and outside the country (through the infamous "<a href="/wiki/Operation_Condor" title="Operation Condor">Operation Condor</a>"). Despite its brutality, like other <a href="/wiki/Totalitarianism" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian regimes</a> in history, due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s.</p>


<p>Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals <a href="/wiki/Ernesto_Geisel" title="Ernesto Geisel">Geisel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Golbery_do_Couto_e_Silva" title="Golbery do Couto e Silva">Golbery</a>. With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which would be completed during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Civilians returned to power in 1985 when José Sarney assumed the presidency, becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime. Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_election,_1989" title="Brazilian presidential election, 1989">election in 1989</a> of the almost unknown <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Collor_de_Mello" title="Fernando Collor de Mello">Fernando Collor</a>, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.</p>
<p>Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President <a href="/wiki/Itamar_Franco" title="Itamar Franco">Itamar Franco</a>, who appointed <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso" title="Fernando Henrique Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a> as Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful <a href="/wiki/Plano_Real" title="Plano Real">Plano Real</a>, that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally granted stability to the Brazilian economy, leading Cardoso to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_election,_1994" title="Brazilian presidential election, 1994">elected that year</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_election,_1998" title="Brazilian presidential election, 1998">again in 1998</a>.</p>
<p>The peaceful transition of power from Fernando Henrique to his main opposition leader, <a href="/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva" title="Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_election,_2002" title="Brazilian presidential election, 2002">elected in 2002</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_election,_2006" title="Brazilian presidential election, 2006">re-elected in 2006</a>), was seen as a proof that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability.

It is also the only country to have contiguous territory both inside and outside the tropics. Brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 metres (660 ft) and 800 metres (2,600 ft) in elevation. The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country. The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.</p>
<p>The southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 metres (3,900 ft). These ranges include the <a href="/wiki/Mantiqueira_Mountains" title="Mantiqueira Mountains">Mantiqueira</a> and <a href="/wiki/Espinha%C3%A7o_Mountains" title="Espinhaço Mountains">Espinhaço</a> mountains and the <a href="/wiki/Serra_do_Mar" title="Serra do Mar">Serra do Mar</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Climate_of_Brazil" title="Climate of Brazil">Climate of Brazil</a></div>
<p>The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical. According to the <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification" title="Köppen climate classification">Köppen system</a>, Brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes: <a href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforest_climate" title="Tropical rainforest climate">equatorial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_climate" title="Tropical climate">tropical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Semi-arid_climate" title="Semi-arid climate">semiarid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_climate" title="Tropical climate">highland tropical</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperateness" title="Temperateness">temperate</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Subtropics" title="Subtropics">subtropical</a>. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests">equatorial rainforests</a> in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to <a href="/wiki/Temperate_coniferous_forest" title="Temperate coniferous forest">temperate coniferous forests</a> in the south and <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_grasslands,_savannas,_and_shrublands" title="Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands">tropical savannas</a> in central Brazil. Many regions have starkly different <a href="/wiki/Microclimate" title="Microclimate">microclimates</a>.</p>

<p>An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real <a href="/wiki/Dry_season" title="Dry season">dry season</a>, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls. Temperatures average 25 °C (77 °F), with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.</p>
<p>Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate. This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude. In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme. The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres (31.5 in) of rain, most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought. Brazil's 1877–78 <i><a href="/wiki/Grande_Seca" title="Grande Seca">Grande Seca</a></i> (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history, caused approximately half a million deaths. A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.</p>
<p>South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of São Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year. The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18 °C (64.4 °F); winter frosts and <a href="/wiki/Snow_in_Brazil" title="Snow in Brazil">snowfall</a> are not rare in the highest areas.</p>

In the south, the <a href="/wiki/Araucaria" title="Araucaria">Araucaria</a> pine forest grows under temperate conditions. The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of <a href="/wiki/Wildlife_of_Brazil" title="Wildlife of Brazil">plant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wildlife_of_Brazil" title="Wildlife of Brazil">animal species</a> in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.</p>

Concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues. Brazil's Amazon Basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species, including the <a href="/wiki/Red-bellied_piranha" title="Red-bellied piranha">red-bellied piranha</a>. Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.</p>
<p>The natural heritage of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, oil and gas extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species. In many areas of the country, the natural environment is threatened by development. Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape. At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial <a href="/wiki/Belo_Monte_Dam" title="Belo Monte Dam">Belo Monte</a> hydroelectric dam.</p>

The President appoints the <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_State" title="Minister of State">Ministers of State</a>, who assist in government. Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The <a href="/wiki/National_Congress_of_Brazil" title="National Congress of Brazil">National Congress</a> is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Brazil" title="Chamber of Deputies of Brazil">Chamber of Deputies</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Senate_of_Brazil" title="Senate of Brazil">Federal Senate</a>. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. Brazil is a <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, according to the <a href="/wiki/Democracy_Index" title="Democracy Index">Democracy Index</a> 2010.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Federation is the "indissoluble union" of the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District. The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">federation</a> is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution. The executive and legislative are organized <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers" title="Separation of powers">independently in all three spheres of government</a>, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.</p>

<p>All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams. For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.</p>
<p>Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Brazil)" title="Workers' Party (Brazil)">Workers' Party</a> (PT), <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Social_Democracy_Party" title="Brazilian Social Democracy Party">Brazilian Social Democracy Party</a> (PSDB), <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Democratic_Movement_Party" title="Brazilian Democratic Movement Party">Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</a> (PMDB) and <a href="/wiki/Democrats_(Brazil)" title="Democrats (Brazil)">Democrats</a> (DEM). Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly. Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.</p>

<p>Brazilian law is based on <a href="/wiki/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman</a>-<a href="/wiki/Germania" title="Germania">Germanic</a> traditions and <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a> concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.</p>

<p>The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules. As of April 2007, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution. Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" (<span lang="pt"><i>leis orgânicas</i></span>), which act in a similar way to constitutions. Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms. Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Brazil" title="Constitution of Brazil">Federal Constitution</a> allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments. There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts. The highest court is the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Federal_Court" title="Supreme Federal Court">Supreme Federal Court</a>.</p>
<p>This system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings. Nevertheless, the Supreme Federal Tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television, and also via <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>. More recently, in December 2009, the Supreme Court adopted <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> to display items on the day planner of the ministers, to inform the daily actions of the Court and the most important decisions made by them.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Brazil" title="Foreign relations of Brazil">Foreign relations of Brazil</a></div>

<p>Brazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Brazil" title="Constitution of Brazil">Federal Constitution</a>, which establishes <a href="/wiki/Non-interventionism" title="Non-interventionism">non-intervention</a>, <a href="/wiki/Self-determination" title="Self-determination">self-determination</a>, <a href="/wiki/Internationalism_(politics)" title="Internationalism (politics)">international cooperation</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Peacebuilding" title="Peacebuilding">peaceful settlement of conflicts</a> as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations. According to the Constitution, the <a href="/wiki/President_of_Brazil" title="President of Brazil">President</a> has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the <a href="/wiki/National_Congress_of_Brazil" title="National Congress of Brazil">Congress</a> is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and <a href="/wiki/Treaty" title="Treaty">international treaties</a>, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.</p>
<p>Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a <a href="/wiki/Regional_power" title="Regional power">regional power</a> in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, a leader among <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a>, and an emerging <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_power" title="World power">world power</a>. Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of <a href="/wiki/Multilateralism" title="Multilateralism">multilateralism</a>, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.</p>
<p>An increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries. Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels. Total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical cooperation of around $480 million ($30 million in 2010 provided directly by the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC))</li>
<li>an estimated $450 million for in-kind expertise provided by Brazilian institutions specialising in technical cooperation</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haiti_Earthquake" title="Haiti Earthquake">Haiti</a> ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the <a href="/wiki/World_Food_Programme" title="World Food Programme">World Food Programme</a> ($300 million). This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies. The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India. The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a "global model in waiting."</p>

<p>In Brazil, the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Brazil" title="Constitution of Brazil">Constitution</a> establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Federal_Police_Department" title="Federal Police Department">Federal Police Department</a>, <a href="/wiki/Federal_Highway_Police" title="Federal Highway Police">Federal Highway Police</a>, <a href="/wiki/Federal_Railroad_Police" title="Federal Railroad Police">Federal Railroad Police</a>, <a href="/wiki/Military_Police_(Brazil)" title="Military Police (Brazil)">Military Police</a> and <a href="/wiki/Civil_Police_(Brazil)" title="Civil Police (Brazil)">Civil Police</a>. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments.

The <a href="/wiki/National_Public_Security_Force" title="National Public Security Force">National Public Security Force</a> also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>The country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate" title="List of countries by intentional homicide rate">highest rates of intentional homicide of the world</a>. The number considered tolerable by the WHO is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. However, there are differences between the crime rates in the <a href="/wiki/States_of_Brazil" title="States of Brazil">Brazilian states</a>. While in <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)" title="São Paulo (state)">São Paulo</a> the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in <a href="/wiki/Alagoas" title="Alagoas">Alagoas</a> it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Brazil is a federation composed of 26 <a href="/wiki/Federated_state" title="Federated state">States</a>, one <a href="/wiki/Federal_District_(Brazil)" title="Federal District (Brazil)">Federal district</a> (which contains the capital city, <a href="/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia" title="Brasília">Brasília</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Municipality" title="Municipality">Municipalities</a>. States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.</p>
<p>The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Northern_Region,_Brazil" title="Northern Region, Brazil">Northern</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil" title="Northeast Region, Brazil">Northeast</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central-West_Region,_Brazil" title="Central-West Region, Brazil">Central-West</a>, <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Region,_Brazil" title="Southeast Region, Brazil">Southeast</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southern_Region,_Brazil" title="Southern Region, Brazil">Southern</a>. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.</p>
<p>Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government. Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called <i><a href="/wiki/Comarca" title="Comarca">comarca</a></i> (county).</p>

<p>Brazil pegged its currency, the <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_real" title="Brazilian real">real</a>, to the U.S. dollar in 1994. However, after the <a href="/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis" title="1997 Asian financial crisis">East Asian financial crisis</a>, the <a href="/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis" title="1998 Russian financial crisis">Russian default</a> in 1998 and the series of adverse financial events that followed it, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Brazil" title="Central Bank of Brazil">Central Bank of Brazil</a> temporarily changed its <a href="/wiki/Monetary_policy" title="Monetary policy">monetary policy</a> to a managed-float scheme while undergoing a <a href="/wiki/Currency_crisis" title="Currency crisis">currency crisis</a>, until definitively changing the exchange regime to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free-float" title="Free-float">free-float</a> in January 1999.</p>
<p>Brazil received an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4 billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, although it was not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall in the value of the U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, <a href="/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment" title="Foreign direct investment">foreign direct investment</a> (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8 billion for 2007.

<p>Corruption costs Brazil almost $41 billion a year alone, with 69.9% of the country's firms identifying the issue as a major constraint in successfully penetrating the global market. Local government corruption is so prevalent that voters perceive it as a problem only if it surpasses certain levels, and only if a local media e.g. a radio station is present to divulge the findings of corruption charges.

<p>Tourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country.

<p>In terms of the 2015 <a href="/wiki/Travel_and_Tourism_Competitiveness_Report" title="Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report">Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index</a> (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level, third in the <a href="/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Brazil's main competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Heritage_site" title="World Heritage site">World Heritage sites</a>. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation. Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/World_Tourism_Organization" title="World Tourism Organization">World Tourism Organization</a> (WTO), international travel to Brazil accelerated in 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005. However, in 2006 a slow-down took place, and international arrivals had almost no growth in 2007–08. In spite of this trend, revenues from international tourism continued to rise, from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USD" title="USD">USD</a> 4 billion in 2005 to 5 billion in 2007, despite 330 000 fewer arrivals. This favorable trend is the result of the strong devaluation of the US dollar against the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brazilian_Real" title="Brazilian Real">Brazilian Real</a>, which began in 2004, but which makes Brazil a more expensive international destination. This trend changed in 2009, when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Recession" title="Great Recession">Great Recession</a> of 2008–09. By 2010, the industry had recovered, and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.2 million international visitors, and receipts from these visitors reached USD 6 billion. In 2011 the historical record was reached with 5.4 million visitors and <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$6.8</span> billion in receipts.</p>
<p>Despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues, the number of Brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003, resulting in a net negative <a href="/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market" title="Foreign exchange market">foreign exchange</a> balance, as more money is spent abroad by Brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting Brazil. Tourism expenditures abroad grew from USD 5.8 billion in 2006, to USD 8.2 billion in 2007, a 42% increase, representing a net deficit of USD 3.3 billion in 2007, as compared to USD 1.5 billion in 2006, a 125% increase from the previous year. This trend is caused by Brazilians taking advantage of the stronger <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_real" title="Brazilian real">Real</a> to travel and making relatively cheaper expenditures abroad. Brazilians traveling overseas in 2006 represented 4% of the country's population.</p>
<p>In 2005, tourism contributed with 3.2% of the country's revenues from exports of goods and services, and represented 7% of direct and indirect employment in the Brazilian economy. In 2006 direct employment in the sector reached 1.9 million people. Domestic tourism is a fundamental market segment for the industry, as 51 million people traveled throughout the country in 2005, and direct revenues from Brazilian tourists reached USD 22 billion, 5.6 times more receipts than international tourists in 2005.</p>

<p>The first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478. From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.

<p>Religion in Brazil formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples. This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholic Church, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities, and in some instances, <a href="/wiki/Allan_Kardec" title="Allan Kardec">Allan Kardec</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Spiritism" title="Spiritism">Spiritism</a> (a religion which incorporates elements of <a href="/wiki/Spiritualism" title="Spiritualism">spiritualism</a> and Christianity). Religious pluralism increased during the 20th century, and the Protestant community has grown to include over 22% of the population. The most common Protestant denominations are <a href="/wiki/Pentecostalism" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> ones. Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the <a href="/wiki/Baptists" title="Baptists">Baptists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Reformed tradition</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> is the country's predominant faith. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population. According to the 2000 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 73.57% of the population followed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Brazil" title="Roman Catholicism in Brazil">Roman Catholicism</a>; 15.41% <a href="/wiki/Protestantism_in_Brazil" title="Protestantism in Brazil">Protestantism</a>; 1.33% Kardecist spiritism; 1.22% other Christian denominations; 0.31% Afro-Brazilian religions; 0.13% <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>; 0.05% <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>; 0.02% <a href="/wiki/Islam_in_Brazil" title="Islam in Brazil">Islam</a>; 0.01% Amerindian religions; 0.59% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 7.35% have no religion.</p>
<p>However, in the last ten years Protestantism, particularly Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly. After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 7% of the population as of the 2000 census.

<p>The official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. The most famous exception to this is a strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Recognition_of_sign_languages" title="Recognition of sign languages">sign language law</a> that was passed by the <a href="/wiki/National_Congress_of_Brazil" title="National Congress of Brazil">National Congress of Brazil</a>. Legally recognized in 2002, the law was <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulated</a> in 2005.

<p><a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese" title="Brazilian Portuguese">Brazilian Portuguese</a> has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portuguese_Brazilian" title="Portuguese Brazilian">more recent immigrants</a>, coming from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Northern_Portugal" title="Northern Portugal">Northern regions</a>, and in minor degree Portuguese <a href="/wiki/Macaronesia" title="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a>), with a few influences from the <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous languages of the Americas">Amerindian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Languages_of_Africa" title="Languages of Africa">African languages</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/West_Africa" title="West Africa">West African</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bantu_languages" title="Bantu languages">Bantu</a> restricted to the vocabulary only.

<p>Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.</p>

<p>In 1990, the <a href="/wiki/Community_of_Portuguese_Language_Countries" title="Community of Portuguese Language Countries">Community of Portuguese Language Countries</a> (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement_of_1990" title="Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990">agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography</a> to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on 1 January 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies will co-exist. The remaining CPLP countries are free to establish their own transition timetables.</p>

<p>The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European and African elements. Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism. The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Popular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with <a href="/wiki/Samba" title="Samba">samba</a> considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list. <a href="/wiki/Maracatu" title="Maracatu">Maracatu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Afox%C3%AA" title="Afoxê">Afoxê</a> are two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Afro-Brazilian" title="Afro-Brazilian">Afro-Brazilian</a> music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival" title="Brazilian Carnival">Brazilian Carnivals</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Choro" title="Choro">Choro</a> is a very popular music instrumental style. Its origins are in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. In spite of the name, the style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, subtle <a href="/wiki/Modulation_(music)" title="Modulation (music)">modulations</a> and full of <a href="/wiki/Syncopation" title="Syncopation">syncopation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Counterpoint" title="Counterpoint">counterpoint</a>. <a href="/wiki/Bossa_nova" title="Bossa nova">Bossa nova</a> is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.
