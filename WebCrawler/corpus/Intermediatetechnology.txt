<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h3>
<p>History of technology, the development over time of systematic techniques for making and doing things. The term technology, a combination of the Greek technē, "art, craft", with logos, "word, speech", meant in Greece a discourse on the arts, both fine and <a href="/wiki/Applied_arts" title="Applied arts">applied</a>. When it first appeared in English in the 17th century, it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only, and gradually these "arts" themselves came to be the object of the designation. By the early 20th century, the term embraced a growing range of means, processes, and ideas in addition to tools and machines. By mid-century, technology was defined by such phrases as "the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment." Even such broad definitions have been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry and technological activity.</p>
<p>A highly compressed account of the history of technology such as this one must adopt a rigorous methodological pattern if it is to do justice to the subject without grossly distorting it one way or another. The plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological, tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time. Obviously, the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary. One factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of Western technological development in recent centuries; Eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Predecessors">Predecessors</span></h4>
<p>Indian ideological leader <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gandhi" title="Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> is often cited as the "father" of the appropriate technology movement. Though the concept had not been given a name, Gandhi advocated for small, local and predominantly village-based technology to help India's villages become self-reliant. He disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit. In 1925 Gandhi founded the All-India Spinners Association and in 1935 he retired from politics to form the All-India Village Industries Association. Both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement.</p>
<p>China also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and the following <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Revolution" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>. During the Cultural Revolution, development policies based on the idea of "walking on two legs" advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="E._F._Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</span></h4>
<p>Despite these early examples, <a href="/wiki/E._F._Schumacher" title="E. F. Schumacher">Dr. Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher</a> is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement. A well-known economist, Schumacher worked for the British National Coal Board for more than 20 years, where he blamed the size of the industry's operations for its uncaring response to the harm <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_lung_disease" title="Black lung disease">black-lung disease</a> inflicted on the miners. However it was his work with developing countries, such as <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Burma" title="Burma">Burma</a>, which helped Schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology.</p>
<p>Schumacher first articulated the idea of "intermediate technology," now known as appropriate technology, in a 1962 report to the Indian Planning Commission in which he described India as long in labor and short in capital, calling for an "intermediate industrial technology" that harnessed India's labor surplus. Schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the Planning Commission report. In 1955, following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of Burma, he published the short paper "Economics in a Buddhist Country," his first known critique of the effects of Western economics on developing countries. In addition to Buddhism, Schumacher also credited his ideas to Gandhi.</p>
<p>Initially, Schumacher's ideas were rejected by both the Indian government and leading development economists. Spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish, Schumacher, George McRobie, <a href="/wiki/Mansur_Hoda" title="Mansur Hoda">Mansur Hoda</a> and Julia Porter brought together a group of approximately 20 people to form the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intermediate_Technology_Development_Group" title="Intermediate Technology Development Group">Intermediate Technology Development Group</a> (ITDG) in May 1965. Later that year, a Schumacher article published in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Observer_newspaper" title="Observer newspaper">Observer</a> garnered significant attention and support for the group. In 1967, the group published the <i>Tools for Progress: A Guide to Small-scale Equipment for Rural Development</i> and sold 7,000 copies. ITDG also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs (such as building construction, energy and water) to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs. At a conference hosted by the ITDG in 1968 the term "intermediate technology" was discarded in favor of the term "appropriate technology" used today. Intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced (or high) technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents. In 1973, Schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work, <i>Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered.</i></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Growing_trend">Growing trend</span></h4>

<p>Between 1966 and 1975 the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years. There was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations, particularly issues related to energy and the environment. In 1977, the OECD identified in its <i>Appropriate Technology Directory</i> 680 organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology. By 1980, this number had grown to more than 1,000. International agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology, indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Inter-American_Development_Bank" title="Inter-American Development Bank">Inter-American Development Bank</a> created a Committee for the Application of Intermediate Technology in 1976 and the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> established the Appropriate Technology for Health Program in 1977.</p>
<p>Appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries. For example, the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the <a href="/wiki/National_Center_for_Appropriate_Technology" title="National Center for Appropriate Technology">National Center for Appropriate Technology</a> (NCAT) in 1977 with an initial appropriation of 3 million dollars from the U.S. Congress. The Center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to "help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life, and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand." However, by 1981 the NCAT's funding agency, Community Services Administration, had been abolished. For several decades NCAT worked with the US departments of Energy and Agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs. Since 2005, NCAT's informational web site is no longer funded by the US government.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Decline">Decline</span></h4>
<p>In more recent years, the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence. Germany's German Appropriate Technology Exchange (GATE) and Holland's Technology Transfer for Development (TOOL) are examples of organizations no longer in operation. Recently, a study looked at the continued barriers to AT deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age. The barriers have been identified as: AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology, technical transferability and robustness of AT, insufficient funding, weak institutional support, and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.</p>
<p>A more <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a>-centric view has also begun to dominate the field. For example, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Polak" title="Paul Polak">Paul Polak</a>, founder of <a href="/wiki/International_Development_Enterprises" title="International Development Enterprises">International Development Enterprises</a> (an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology), declared appropriate technology dead in a 2010 blog post.</p>
<p>Polak argues the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Design_for_the_other_90_percent" title="Design for the other 90 percent">design for the other 90 percent</a>" movement has replaced appropriate technology. Growing out of the appropriate technology movement, designing for the other 90 percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the 5.8 billion of the world's 6.8 billion population "who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted."</p>
<p>Many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular "<a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>" movement, which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future <a href="/wiki/Generation" title="Generation">generations</a>. In 1983, the OECD published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled, <i>The World of Appropriate Technology,</i> in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by "low investment cost per work-place, low capital investment per unit of output, organizational simplicity, high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment, sparing use of natural resources, low cost of final product or high potential for employment." Today, the OECD web site redirects from the "Glossary of Statistical Terms" entry on "appropriate technology" to "environmentally sound technologies." The United Nations' "Index to Economic and Social Development" also redirects from the "appropriate technology" entry to "sustainable development."</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Potential_resurgence">Potential resurgence</span></h4>
<p>Despite the decline, several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence, including the ITDG which became <a href="/wiki/Practical_Action" title="Practical Action">Practical Action</a> after a name change in 2005. <a class="external text" href="http://wwws.skat.ch" rel="nofollow">Skat</a> (Schwierzerische Kontaktstelle für Angepasste Technology) adapted by becoming a private consultancy in 1998, though some Intermediate Technology activities are continued by <a class="external text" href="http://www.skat.ch/foundation" rel="nofollow">Skat Foundation</a> through the <a class="external text" href="http://www.rural-water-supply.net/" rel="nofollow">Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN)</a>. Another actor still very active is the charity <a class="external text" href="https://www.ceas.ch" rel="nofollow">CEAS (Centre Ecologique Albert Schweitzer)</a>. Pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters, it offers vocational training in West Africa and Madagascar. There is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_source_appropriate_technology" title="Open source appropriate technology">open source appropriate technology</a> (OSAT) because of the enabling technology of the Internet. These OSAT groups include: <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=AKVO&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="AKVO (page does not exist)">AKVO</a>, <a href="/wiki/Appropedia" title="Appropedia">Appropedia</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Appropriate_Technology_Collaborative&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Appropriate Technology Collaborative (page does not exist)">Appropriate Technology Collaborative</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Catalytic_Communities&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Catalytic Communities (page does not exist)">Catalytic Communities</a>, <a href="/wiki/Centre_for_Alternative_Technology" title="Centre for Alternative Technology">Centre for Alternative Technology</a>, Center For Development Alternatives, <a href="/wiki/Engineers_Without_Borders" title="Engineers Without Borders">Engineers Without Borders</a>, <a href="/wiki/Open_Source_Ecology" title="Open Source Ecology">Open Source Ecology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Practical_Action" title="Practical Action">Practical Action</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Village_Earth" title="Village Earth">Village Earth</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h3>
<p>Appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology. Frequently these terms are used interchangeably; however, the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus, bias or agenda of the technological choice in question. Though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology, "intermediate technology" is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than "inefficient" traditional technologies, but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies. Other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include:</p>
<div class="div-col columns column-width" style="-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em;">
<ul>
<li>Capital-saving technology</li>
<li>Labor-intensive technology</li>
<li>Alternate technology</li>
<li>Self-help technology</li>
<li>Village-level technology</li>
<li>Community technology</li>
<li>Progressive technology</li>
<li>Indigenous technology</li>
<li>People’s technology</li>
<li>Light-engineering technology</li>
<li>Adaptive technology</li>
<li>Light-capital technology</li>
<li>Soft technology</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms. However, the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list. Furthermore, the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables. Some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization (such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology), while others may emphasize the importance of human development (such as self-help and people's technology).</p>
<p>It is also possible to distinguish between <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i> technologies. According to Dr. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maurice_Albertson" title="Maurice Albertson">Maurice Albertson</a> and Audrey Faulkner, appropriate <i>hard</i> technology is "engineering techniques, physical structures, and machinery that meet a need defined by a community, and utilize the material at hand or readily available. It can be built, operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance (e.g., technical, material, or financial). it is usually related to an economic goal."</p>
<p>Albertson and Faulkner consider appropriate <i>soft</i> technology as technology that deals with "the social structures, human interactive processes, and motivation techniques. It is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations, making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change."</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Development">Development</span></h3>
<p>Schumacher's initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a country's economy, such as <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP). Developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Based on the continuing rise in income levels in Western countries since the Industrial Revolution, developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic "take-off" in the developing countries.</p>
<p>However, by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries. In many countries, this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country. However, it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes. The foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites. This was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities. The increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to "increasing squalor, severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure."</p>
<p>Appropriate technology was meant to address four problems: extreme poverty, starvation, unemployment and urban migration. Schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty. Schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas (where a majority of the population still lived) and on increasing employment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_developed_countries">In developed countries</span></h3>
<p>The term <i>appropriate technology</i> is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society, i.e., technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate. <a href="/wiki/E._F._Schumacher" title="E. F. Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</a> asserts that such technology, described in the book <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Small_is_Beautiful" title="Small is Beautiful">Small is Beautiful</a></i> tends to promote values such as <a href="/wiki/Health" title="Health">health</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beauty" title="Beauty">beauty</a> and permanence, in that order.</p>
<p>Often the type of appropriate technology that is used in developed countries is "appropriate and sustainable technology" (AST), appropriate technology that, besides being functional and relatively cheap (though often more expensive than true AT), is durable and employs <a href="/wiki/Renewable_resource" title="Renewable resource">renewable resources</a>. AT does not include this (see <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_design" title="Sustainable design">Sustainable design</a>).</p>

<p>In order to increase the efficiency of a great number of city services (efficient water provisioning, efficient electricity provisioning, easy traffic flow, water drainage, decreased spread of disease with <a href="/wiki/Epidemic" title="Epidemic">epidemics</a>, ...), the city itself must first be built correctly.

<p>The most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil. Other techniques, such as varying forms of filtration, chemical disinfection, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation (including solar UV) have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of POU measures in reducing waterborne disease. The ability of POU options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness. Technologies may generate more (or less) health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest.</p>
<p>The current priority of the proponents of POU treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis. Few POU measures have reached significant scale thus far, but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world's poor have only been under way for a few years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, in the form of water treatment kiosks (also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers). While quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable, sophisticated technology (such as multi-stage particle filtration, UV irradiation, ozonation, and membrane filtration) is applied with increasing frequency. Such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices, with increasing government regulation. Initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging.</p>
<p>Whether applied at the household or community level, some examples of specific treatment processes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Ceramic_water_filter" title="Ceramic water filter">Porous ceramic filtration</a>, using either clay or <a href="/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth" title="Diatomaceous earth">diatomaceous earth</a>, and oriented as either cylinder, pot, or disk, with gravity-fed or siphon-driven delivery systems.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sanitation">Sanitation</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">Sanitation</a></div>
<p>Poor sanitation is a major issue for a large proportion of the human population, with about 2.5 billion people lacking even the most basic forms of sanitation and more than a billion people worldwide practising <a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">open defecation</a> in 2015 according to the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Monitoring_Programme_for_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation" title="Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation">Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>.</p>
<p>The ideas of appropriate technology influenced the provision of sanitation systems for many years. However, since about the early 2000s there has been a departure from a focus on simplistic 'one-size-fits-all' sanitation systems. As conditions vary, sanitation systems also need to vary to meet the needs of the users and other <a href="/wiki/Project_stakeholder" title="Project stakeholder">stakeholders</a>.</p>
<p>Technologies for sanitation provision, such as <a href="/wiki/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilets</a>, are important but only one piece of the puzzle. Sanitation needs to be regarded as a system that includes technical and non-technical aspects, such as <a href="/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)" title="Behavior change (public health)">behavior change</a> and management as well as political aspects - the enabling environment. The overall aim should be to achieve a <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_sanitation" title="Sustainable sanitation">sustainable sanitation</a> system. One option of achieving that aim can be the <a href="/wiki/Ecological_sanitation" title="Ecological sanitation">ecological sanitation</a> approach which focuses on safe <a href="/wiki/Reuse_of_excreta" title="Reuse of excreta">reuse of excreta</a>.</p>
<p>It is impossible to name all possible sanitation technologies that may fall under the category of "appropriate technologies" but some common systems which might be considered to be "appropriate" include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Dry_toilet" title="Dry toilet">Dry toilets</a> as they save on flushing water and may allow the nutrients of the excreta to be reused in agriculture (e.g. for fertilising crops). Two examples of dry toilets are <a href="/wiki/Composting_toilet" title="Composting toilet">composting toilets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Urine-diverting_dry_toilet" title="Urine-diverting dry toilet">urine-diverting dry toilets</a>.</li>

<p>Electricity storage (which is required for autonomous energy systems) can be provided through appropriate technology solutions as deep-cycle and car-<a href="/wiki/Battery_(electricity)" title="Battery (electricity)">batteries</a> (intermediate technology), long duration flywheels, electrochemical capacitors, compressed air energy storage (CAES), liquid nitrogen and pumped hydro.

Also, vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion.</p>
<p>Bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas. An example of this is Karaba, a free-trade coffee co-op in Rwanda, which uses 400 modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing. Other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power. However recent reports suggest that these rickshaws are not plying on the roads.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_care">Health care</span></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Global_Health_Council" title="Global Health Council">Global Health Council</a>, rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors, the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate. Trained villagers are able to eliminate 80% of the health problems. Small (low-cost) hospitals – based on the model of the Jamkhed hospital – can remedy another 15%, while only 5% will need to go to a larger (more expensive) hospital.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady, accurate diagnosis is required. This may be done manually (through observation, inquiries) and by specialized tools.</li>
<li>A <a href="/wiki/Phase-change_incubator" title="Phase-change incubator">phase-change incubator</a>, developed in the late 1990s, is a low cost way for health workers to incubate microbial samples.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Birth_control" title="Birth control">Birth control</a> is also seen as an appropriate technology, especially now, because of increasing population numbers (overpopulating certain areas), increasing food prices and poverty. It has been proposed to a certain degree by PATH (program for appropriate technology in health).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Jaipur_leg" title="Jaipur leg">Jaipur leg</a> was developed by Dr. P. K. Sethi and Masterji Ram Chander in 1968 as an inexpensive prosthetic leg for victims of landmine explosions.</li>

<p>According to proponents, Appropriate Technologies can greatly reduce the labor required to prepare food, compared to traditional methods, while being much simpler and cheaper than the processing used in Western countries. This reflects <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/E.F._Schumacher" title="E.F. Schumacher">E.F.

Private <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_protocol" title="Internet protocol">Internet protocol</a> networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider.</li>
<li>Rural electrical grids can be wired with "optical phase cable", in which one or more of the <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/armor" title="wikt:armor">armor</a> wires are replaced with steel tubes containing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fiber_optics" title="Fiber optics">fiber optics</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access" title="Satellite Internet access">Satellite Internet access</a> can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations, however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wimax" title="Wimax">Wimax</a> and forms of <a href="/wiki/Packet_radio" title="Packet radio">packet radio</a> can also be used. Depending on the speed and latency of these networks they may be capable of relaying <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VoIP" title="VoIP">VoIP</a> traffic, negating the need for separate telephony services. Finally, the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Radio_Linking_Project" title="Internet Radio Linking Project">Internet Radio Linking Project</a> provides potential for blending older (cheap) local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Satellite_phone" title="Satellite phone">satellite</a>-based telephone systems can also be used, as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PABX" title="PABX">PABX</a> or local IP-based network.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Finance">Finance</span></h3>
<p>Through financial systems envisioned especially for the poor/developed world, many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital. Often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business (such as with <a href="/wiki/Microfinance" title="Microfinance">microfinance</a>). In other systems, people for a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rotating_Savings_and_Credit_Association" title="Rotating Savings and Credit Association">Rotating Savings and Credit Association</a> or ROSCA to purchase costly material together (such as <a href="/wiki/Tontine" title="Tontine">Tontines</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Susu_account" title="Susu account">Susu accounts</a>). Organisations, communities, cities or individuals can provide loans to other communities/cities (such as with the approach followed by <a href="/wiki/Kiva_(organization)" title="Kiva (organization)">Kiva</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://microloans.worldvision.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">World Vision Microloans</a> <a href="/wiki/MicroPlace" title="MicroPlace">MicroPlace</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LETS" title="LETS">LETS</a>). Finally, in certain communities (usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases) everything of value is shared. This is called <a href="/wiki/Gift_economy" title="Gift economy">gift economy</a>.</p>

<p>Features such as low cost, low usage of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a> and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a>. For that reason, these technologies are sometimes used and promoted by advocates of sustainability and <a href="/wiki/Alternative_technology" title="Alternative technology">alternative technology</a>.</p>
<p>Besides using natural, locally available resources (e.g. wood or adobe), waste materials imported from cities using conventional (and inefficient) waste management may be gathered and re-used to build a sustainable living environment. Use of these cities' waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost. When obtained, the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city/community, using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cradle_to_cradle_design" title="Cradle to cradle design">cradle to cradle design</a> method. Locations where waste can be found include <a href="/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wreck_yard" title="Wreck yard">junkyards</a>, on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways. Organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages. Also, town districts and other places (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Cemetery" title="Cemetery">cemeteries</a>) that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone, concrete, or potassium.</p>
