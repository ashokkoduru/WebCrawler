<p><b>New Urbanism</b> is an <a href="/wiki/Urban_design" title="Urban design">urban design</a> movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating <a href="/wiki/Walkability" title="Walkability">walkable</a> neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of <a href="/wiki/Real_estate_development" title="Real estate development">real estate development</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urban_planning" title="Urban planning">urban planning</a>, and municipal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Land-use" title="Land-use">land-use</a> strategies.</p>
<p>New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and <a href="/wiki/Transit-oriented_development" title="Transit-oriented development">transit-oriented development</a> (TOD). These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.</p>

<p>The organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the <i>Charter of the New Urbanism</i>, which begins:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, and building practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Urbanists support: <a href="/wiki/Regional_planning" title="Regional planning">regional planning</a> for open space; context-appropriate <a href="/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a> and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Suburban_sprawl" title="Suburban sprawl">suburban sprawl</a>. The <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charter_of_the_New_Urbanism" title="Charter of the New Urbanism">Charter of the New Urbanism</a></i> also covers issues such as <a href="/wiki/Historic_preservation" title="Historic preservation">historic preservation</a>, safe streets, <a href="/wiki/Green_building" title="Green building">green building</a>, and the re-development of <a href="/wiki/Brownfield_land" title="Brownfield land">brownfield land</a>. The ten <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Principles_of_Intelligent_Urbanism" title="Principles of Intelligent Urbanism">Principles of Intelligent Urbanism</a> also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>

<p>Until the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">mass transit</a> the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as <a href="/wiki/Streetcar_suburb" title="Streetcar suburb">streetcar suburbs</a>. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car. Specifically, after World War II <a href="/wiki/Urban_planner" title="Urban planner">urban planning</a> largely centered around the use of municipal <a href="/wiki/Zoning" title="Zoning">zoning</a> ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of <a href="/wiki/Automobile_dependency" title="Automobile dependency">automobile dependency</a>.</p>

<p>This new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and became known as "conventional suburban development" or pejoratively as <a href="/wiki/Urban_sprawl" title="Urban sprawl">urban sprawl</a>. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in <a href="/wiki/Suburb" title="Suburb">suburban</a> communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared.</p>

<p>Although New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Modernist" title="Modernist">modernist</a> planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Mumford" title="Lewis Mumford">Lewis Mumford</a> criticized the "anti-urban" development of post-war America. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities" title="The Death and Life of Great American Cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>,</i> written by <a href="/wiki/Jane_Jacobs" title="Jane Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a> in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the "norm." The French architect <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Spoerry" title="François Spoerry">François Spoerry</a> has developed in the 60' the concept of "soft architecture" that he applied to <a href="/wiki/Port_Grimaud" title="Port Grimaud">Port Grimaud</a>, a new marina in south of France. The success of this project will have a considerable influence and will lead to many new projects of soft architecture like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Port_Libert%C3%A9" title="Port Liberté">Port Liberté</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> or <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Le_Plessis_Robisson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Le Plessis Robisson (page does not exist)">Le Plessis Robisson</a> in France.</p>
<p>Rooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the "European" city proposed by architect <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leon_Krier" title="Leon Krier">Leon Krier</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Pattern_language" title="Pattern language">pattern language</a> theories of <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Alexander" title="Christopher Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>. The term "new urbanism" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.</p>
<p>In 1991, the <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Commission_(Sacramento,_California)" title="Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)">Local Government Commission</a>, a private nonprofit group in <a href="/wiki/Sacramento,_California" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento, California</a>, invited architects <a href="/wiki/Peter_Calthorpe" title="Peter Calthorpe">Peter Calthorpe</a>, Michael Corbett, <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Duany" title="Andrés Duany">Andrés Duany</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Elizabeth_Moule&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Elizabeth Moule (page does not exist)">Elizabeth Moule</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Plater-Zyberk" title="Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk">Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stefanos_Polyzoides" title="Stefanos Polyzoides">Stefanos Polyzoides</a>, and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Solomon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Daniel Solomon (page does not exist)">Daniel Solomon</a> to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the <i>Ahwahnee Principles</i> (after <a href="/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park" title="Yosemite National Park">Yosemite National Park</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Ahwahnee_Hotel" title="Ahwahnee Hotel">Ahwahnee Hotel</a>), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.</p>
<p>Calthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities.</p>
<p>In 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are "a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world." They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a "culture of permanence." </p>
<p>New Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Defining_elements">Defining elements</span></h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Duany" title="Andrés Duany">Andrés Duany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Plater-Zyberk" title="Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk">Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk</a>, two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</a> neighborhoods of <a href="/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center.</li>
<li>Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly 0.25 miles (0.40 km).</li>
<li>There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses, <a href="/wiki/Terraced_house" title="Terraced house">rowhouses</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apartment_building" title="Apartment building">apartments</a> — so that younger and older people, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Single_(relationship)" title="Single (relationship)">singles</a> and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live.</li>
<li>At the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household.</li>
<li>A small ancillary building or <a href="/wiki/Garage_apartment" title="Garage apartment">garage apartment</a> is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop).</li>
<li>An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home.</li>
<li>There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away.</li>
<li>Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination.</li>
<li>The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles.</li>
<li>Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room.</li>
<li>Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys.</li>
<li>Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h2>

<p>Several terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the "new" moniker. The term "Walkable Urbanism" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger. Many debate whether <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smart_Growth" title="Smart Growth">Smart Growth</a> and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist <a href="/wiki/Peter_Calthorpe" title="Peter Calthorpe">Peter Calthorpe</a> and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">Sustainable development</a> is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and <a href="/wiki/Agenda_21" title="Agenda 21">Agenda 21</a> to include <a href="/wiki/Human_development_(humanity)" title="Human development (humanity)">human development</a> issues (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing country</a>) that exceed the scope of <a href="/wiki/Land_development" title="Land development">land development</a> intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_Urbanism" title="Sustainable Urbanism">Sustainable Urbanism</a>. The term livability or livable communities has also become popular under U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s administration though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Commission_(Sacramento,_California)" title="Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)">Local Government Commission</a>.</p>

<p>Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of "urbanisms" in an article in 2011 titled "A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms."  Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_Urbanism" title="Sustainable Urbanism">Sustainable Urbanism</a> and Tactical Urbanism (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide. In 2011 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Andres_Duany" title="Andres Duany">Andres Duany</a> authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design. In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Andres_Duany" title="Andres Duany">Andres Duany</a> began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.</p>
<p>Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecological_Urbanism" title="Ecological Urbanism">Ecological Urbanism</a>, and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. <a href="/wiki/Landscape_urbanism" title="Landscape urbanism">Landscape urbanism</a> was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University. A book called Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents, edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of <a href="/wiki/Urbanism" title="Urbanism">urbanism</a>. <a href="/wiki/Michael_E._Arth" title="Michael E. Arth">Michael E. Arth</a> promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the <a href="/wiki/New_pedestrianism" title="New pedestrianism">New Pedestrianism</a>, which is intended to be a more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 <a href="/wiki/Planned_community" title="Planned community">planned community</a> in <a href="/wiki/Radburn,_New_Jersey" title="Radburn, New Jersey">Radburn, New Jersey</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organizations">Organizations</span></h2>


<p>The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congress_for_the_New_Urbanism" title="Congress for the New Urbanism">Congress for the New Urbanism</a> (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions. CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Livable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks.</li>
<li>A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels.</li>
<li>Schools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service.</li>
<li>An affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in <a href="/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia" title="Alexandria, Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a>, with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.</p>
<p>The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters. By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more. As of 2013, Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.</p>
<p>While the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU), the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.</p>
<p>By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the <a href="/wiki/Savannah_College_of_Art_and_Design" title="Savannah College of Art and Design">Savannah College of Art and Design</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Georgia" title="University of Georgia">University of Georgia</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame" title="University of Notre Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Miami" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a>. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a "Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists". The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Next_Generation_of_New_Urbanists" title="Next Generation of New Urbanists">Next Generation of New Urbanists</a> held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually as of 2014 with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tactical_Urbanism" title="Tactical Urbanism">Tactical Urbanism</a> Guide.</p>
<p>The CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the <i>New Urban News</i> and the <i>New Town Paper</i>. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Prince%27s_Foundation_for_the_Built_Environment" title="The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment">The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment</a>. Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as <a href="/wiki/International_Network_for_Traditional_Building,_Architecture_%26_Urbanism" title="International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism">INTBAU</a>, A Vision of Europe, and others.</p>
<p>The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smart_Growth" title="Smart Growth">Smart Growth</a> also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Film">Film</span></h2>
<p>The New Urbanism Film Festival was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film <i><a href="/wiki/Urbanized" title="Urbanized">Urbanized</a></i> by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>

<p>New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the <a href="/wiki/Political_spectrum" title="Political spectrum">political spectrum</a>. It has been criticized both for being a <a href="/wiki/Social_engineering_(political_science)" title="Social engineering (political science)">social engineering</a> scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.</p>
<p>In an interview in <i><a href="/wiki/Reason_(magazine)" title="Reason (magazine)">Reason</a></i>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Right-libertarian" title="Right-libertarian">right-libertarian</a> magazine, professor Peter Gordon, a professor of Urban Planning from <a href="/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a>, spoke in favor of suburbanization, stating that the New Urbanism ignores consumer preference the free market and that cities have moved towards car-oriented development because that is what people want.</p>
<p>On the other hand, journalist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alex_Marshall_(Journalist)" title="Alex Marshall (Journalist)">Alex Marshall</a> has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans. In a 1996 article in <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(architecture_magazine)" title="Metropolis (architecture magazine)">Metropolis Magazine</a>, Marshall denounced New Urbanism as "a grand fraud". The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the Washington <i>Post</i> in September of the same year, and in Marshall's first book, <a class="external text" href="http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/marhow" rel="nofollow"><i>How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken</i></a></p>
<p>Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence. Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments, but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.</p>
<p>Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that "communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car". Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of <a href="/wiki/Car-free_movement" title="Car-free movement">car-free developments</a>. Michael E Arth proposes <a href="/wiki/New_pedestrianism" title="New pedestrianism">new pedestrianism</a> as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths. Steve Melia proposes the idea of "filtered permeability" (see <a href="/wiki/Permeability_(spatial_and_transport_planning)" title="Permeability (spatial and transport planning)">Permeability (spatial and transport planning)</a>) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limited the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.</p>
<p>In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LEED-ND" title="LEED-ND">LEED-ND</a>, was developed by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Green_Building_Council" title="U.S. Green Building Council">U.S. Green Building Council</a>, <a href="/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council" title="Natural Resources Defense Council">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congress_for_the_New_Urbanism" title="Congress for the New Urbanism">Congress for the New Urbanism</a>, to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design. New Urbanist and board member of CNU, <a href="/wiki/Doug_Farr" title="Doug Farr">Doug Farr</a> has taken a step further and coined <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_Urbanism" title="Sustainable Urbanism">Sustainable Urbanism</a>, which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.</p>
<p>New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, "instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves". It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.</p>

<p>New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami,_Florida" title="Miami, Florida">Miami, Florida</a>, has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.</p>
<p>More than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of <i><a href="/wiki/Smart_growth" title="Smart growth">smart growth</a></i> legislation.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Seaside">Seaside</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Seaside,_Florida" title="Seaside, Florida">Seaside, Florida</a>, the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on eighty acres (324,000 m²) of <a href="/wiki/Florida_Panhandle" title="Florida Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> coastline. It was featured on the cover of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atlantic_Monthly" title="Atlantic Monthly">Atlantic Monthly</a> in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.</p>
<p>Seaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Truman_Show" title="The Truman Show">The Truman Show</a></i>. Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_countries">Other countries</span></h3>
<p>New Urbanism is closely related to the <a href="/wiki/Urban_village" title="Urban village">Urban village</a> movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is <a href="/wiki/Poundbury" title="Poundbury">Poundbury</a> in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Cornwall" title="Duchy of Cornwall">Duchy of Cornwall</a> under the overview of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prince_Charles" title="Prince Charles">Prince Charles</a>. The original masterplan was designed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leon_Krier" title="Leon Krier">Leon Krier</a>. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_dependency" title="Car dependency">car dependency</a> had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.</p>
<p>The Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congress_for_the_New_Urbanism" title="Congress for the New Urbanism">Congress for the New Urbanism</a> Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Urban_Design_Protocol" title="New Zealand Urban Design Protocol">New Zealand Urban Design Protocol</a> was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.</p>
