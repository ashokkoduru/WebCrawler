<p><b>Bridges to Prosperity</b> is a <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Nonprofit_organization" title="Nonprofit organization">nonprofit organization</a> that builds footbridges and trains local people in developing countries to build <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pedestrian_bridges" title="Pedestrian bridges">pedestrian bridges</a>. It was established by Kenneth Frantz in 2001, after seeing a photo in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Geographic_Magazine" title="National Geographic Magazine">National Geographic Magazine</a> of a broken bridge over the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blue_Nile_River" title="Blue Nile River">Blue Nile River</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, with ten men on either side of the broken span pulling themselves across the chasm by rope. Bridges to Prosperity is now based in the <a href="/wiki/Denver" title="Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado, area.</p>
<p>Footbridges are simple and inexpensive enough for rural communities to build with only modest outside help, and they provide major benefits such as improved safety and access to markets, schools and medical care.</p>
<p>Typically, the training is done through Community Bridge Building programs in which Bridges to Prosperity trains in-country partner organizations or government agencies in both engineering and organizational techniques. Since its founding in March 2001, Bridges to Prosperity or their technology has built over 200 footbridges, and expanded to 18 countries across Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Bridges to Prosperity is supported by and partners with a number of other organizations such as Rotary International.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mission">Mission</span></h2>
<p>Bridges to Prosperity provides isolated communities with access to essential health care, education and economic opportunities by building footbridges over impassable rivers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>


<p>Transport is a crucial driver of development, bringing socio-economic opportunities within the reach of the poor and enabling economies to be more competitive. Transport infrastructure connects people to jobs, education, and health services; it enables the supply of goods and services around the world; and allows people to interact and generate the knowledge that creates long-term growth. Rural roads, for example, can help prevent maternal deaths through timely access to childbirth-related care, boost girls’ enrollment in school, and increase and diversify farmers’ income by connecting them to markets.</p>
<p>The World Bank estimates that over 1 billion people do not have access to transportation networks. B2P determined that positive results could be attained by spreading the technology by building approximately 10-20 <a href="/wiki/Demonstration_(teaching)" title="Demonstration (teaching)">demonstration</a> bridges per country, training locals, partnering with local technological institutes, providing downloadable &amp; easy to use step by step photo and video manuals, and supplying free <a href="/wiki/Wire_rope" title="Wire rope">wire rope</a> and wire rope clamps/clips for post training/demonstration programs. As there is much relating to <a href="/wiki/Best_practice" title="Best practice">best practices</a> B2P has focused on education and training, and the propagation of technical manuals, and footbridge building text books.</p>
<p>Bridges to Prosperity provides the needed capital in the form of free recycled wire rope and strand. Best practice dictates that when capital is provided in this manner, that there are no unintended consequences, e.g. B2P does not provide free cable to countries where there is an existing or budding wire rope industry. Materials are not donated where that would cause unintended harm to existing business. In 2005, B2P received a long term donation of free 7/8 inch to 1.25 inch wire rope from the ports of Portsmouth and <a href="/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia" title="Norfolk, Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. The wire rope donated was American manufactured <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tensile_strength" title="Tensile strength">high tensile</a> steel wire rope used on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gantry_cranes" title="Gantry cranes">gantry cranes</a> for unloading <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Container_ships" title="Container ships">container ships</a>. Later, the port of Baltimore was added, as were Texas and west coast ports. In 2012, approximately 100,000 feet of such donated used wire rope and strand was shipped in an <a href="/wiki/Intermodal_container" title="Intermodal container">intermodal container</a> to programs all over the world. To build one footbridge, the average number of feet of wire rope required is approximately 1,800 feet. Worldwide, there is enough <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Recycled" title="Recycled">recycled</a> wire rope from gantry cranes to build approximately 2,500 footbridges every year. Each container shipped overseas weighs approximately 52,000 pounds and contains 20,000 feet of cable.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Awards">Awards</span></h2>
<p>Bridges to Prosperity has been recognized by a number of global awards. In 2016, B2P was named the 2016 Eurostar Ashden Award for Sustainability, and one of the top 10 social enterprises in the world by <a class="external text" href="https://www.classy.org" rel="nofollow">Classy.org</a> </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Corporate_sponsorship">Corporate sponsorship</span></h2>

<p>Building on the affinity with construction firms, especially those that design and build highway bridges, a corporate sponsor program was started; to allow employees to form teams to design and build footbridges. Today, B2P provides co-branded bridge building opportunities for companies around the world ranging from financial services firms to construction industry giants.</p>
<p>Sponsors include Ross Construction of <a href="/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California" title="Palo Alto, California">Palo Alto, California</a>, Parsons Brinckerhoff of <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and Flatiron Construction, along with Flatiron's parent company, <a href="/wiki/Hochtief" title="Hochtief">Hochtief</a> of Germany, and <a href="/wiki/Turner_Construction" title="Turner Construction">Turner Construction</a>, USA,</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rotary">Rotary</span></h2>
<p>An important supporter have been various <a href="/wiki/Rotary_International" title="Rotary International">Rotary International</a> clubs who collaborate in providing <a href="/wiki/Rotary_Foundation" title="Rotary Foundation">Rotary Foundation</a> matched humanitarian grants.</p>
<p>When Bridges to Prosperity was founded, Kenneth Frantz was a member of the Gloucester Point Rotary Club in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gloucester,_Virginia" title="Gloucester, Virginia">Gloucester, Virginia</a>. That club assisted in the purchase of materials for the repair of the Blue Nile Bridge. There are now over 65 rotary clubs worldwide (and over 800 individual Rotarians) who have participated directly in Bridges to Prosperity programs. Partnerships with the local <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing country</a> rotary clubs, such as the Rotary Club of Nkwazi, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lusaka,_Zambia" title="Lusaka, Zambia">Lusaka, Zambia</a>, facilitate access and operation in countries with little bureaucratic interference. The partnerships with local Rotary clubs allow quick customs clearance of wire rope imports and expedited business contacts, allow USA based Rotarians to easily travel and participate in schemes as well as adding a defense against potential corruption.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="University_programs">University programs</span></h2>

<p>Support from CEO Avery Bang’s alma mater, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Iowa" title="University of Iowa">University of Iowa</a> engineering school, and non-profit Continental Crossings has led the construction of three additional bridges. There are now over 10 each Bridges to Prosperity university chapters in the USA. To start the university program, a fund was established by the Signe Ostby and Scott Cook family.</p>
