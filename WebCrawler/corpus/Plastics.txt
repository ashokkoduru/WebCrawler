<p><b>Plastic</b> is a material consisting of any of a wide range of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Synthetic_polymers" title="Synthetic polymers">synthetic</a> or semi-synthetic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_compounds" title="Organic compounds">organic compounds</a> that are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malleability" title="Malleability">malleable</a> and can be <a href="/wiki/Molding_(process)" title="Molding (process)">molded</a> into solid objects. Plastics are typically <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_polymer" title="Organic polymer">organic polymers</a> of high <a href="/wiki/Molecular_mass" title="Molecular mass">molecular mass</a>, but they often contain other substances. They are usually synthetic, most commonly derived from <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemicals</a>, but many are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters. <a href="/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)" title="Plasticity (physics)">Plasticity</a> is the general property of all materials that are able to irreversibly deform without breaking, but this occurs to such a degree with this class of moldable <a href="/wiki/Polymer" title="Polymer">polymers</a> that their name is an emphasis on this ability.</p>
<p>Due to their relatively low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and imperviousness to water, plastics are used in an enormous and expanding range of products, from paper clips to spaceships. They have already displaced many traditional materials, such as <a href="/wiki/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rock_(geology)" title="Rock (geology)">stone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)" title="Horn (anatomy)">horn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bone" title="Bone">bone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leather" title="Leather">leather</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ceramic" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a>, in most of their former uses. In developed countries, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and another third in buildings such as <a href="/wiki/Piping" title="Piping">piping</a> used in <a href="/wiki/Plumbing" title="Plumbing">plumbing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Vinyl_siding" title="Vinyl siding">vinyl siding</a>. Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic), furniture, and toys. In the developing world, the ratios may be different - for example, reportedly 42% of India's consumption is used in packaging. Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well, to include polymer implants, however the field of <a href="/wiki/Plastic_surgery" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a> is not named for use of plastic material, but rather the more generic meaning of the word plasticity in regards to the reshaping of flesh.</p>
<p>The world's first fully synthetic plastic was <a href="/wiki/Bakelite" title="Bakelite">bakelite</a>, invented in New York in 1907 by <a href="/wiki/Leo_Baekeland" title="Leo Baekeland">Leo Baekeland</a> who coined the term 'plastics'. Many chemists contributed to the <a href="/wiki/Materials_science" title="Materials science">materials science</a> of plastics, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nobel_laureate" title="Nobel laureate">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Staudinger" title="Hermann Staudinger">Hermann Staudinger</a> who has been called "the father of <a href="/wiki/Polymer_chemistry" title="Polymer chemistry">polymer chemistry</a>" and <a href="/wiki/Herman_Francis_Mark" title="Herman Francis Mark">Herman Mark</a>, known as "the father of <a href="/wiki/Polymer_physics" title="Polymer physics">polymer physics</a>". The success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of very large molecules. Toward the end of the century, one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward <a href="/wiki/Plastic_recycling" title="Plastic recycling">recycling</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plastic" title="wikt:plastic">plastic</a></i> is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> πλαστικός (<i>plastikos</i>) meaning "capable of being shaped or molded", from πλαστός (<i>plastos</i>) meaning "molded". It refers to their malleability, or <a href="/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)" title="Plasticity (physics)">plasticity</a> during manufacture, that allows them to be <a href="/wiki/Casting" title="Casting">cast</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hot_isostatic_pressing" title="Hot isostatic pressing">pressed</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extruded" title="Extruded">extruded</a> into a variety of shapes—such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Artificial_membrane" title="Artificial membrane">films</a>, <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_fiber" title="Synthetic fiber">fibers</a>, plates, tubes, bottles, boxes, and much more.</p>
<p>The common word <i>plastic</i> should not be confused with the technical adjective <i>plastic</i>, which is applied to any material which undergoes a permanent change of shape (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plastic_deformation" title="Plastic deformation">plastic deformation</a>) when strained beyond a certain point. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aluminum" title="Aluminum">Aluminum</a> which is stamped or forged, for instance, exhibits plasticity in this sense, but is not plastic in the common sense; in contrast, in their finished forms, some plastics will break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Timeline_of_plastic_development" title="Timeline of plastic development">Timeline of plastic development</a></div>

<p>The development of plastics has evolved from the use of natural plastic materials (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Chewing_gum" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shellac" title="Shellac">shellac</a>) to the use of chemically modified, natural materials (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Natural_rubber" title="Natural rubber">natural rubber</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nitrocellulose" title="Nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a>, <a href="/wiki/Collagen" title="Collagen">collagen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galalith" title="Galalith">galalite</a>) and finally to completely synthetic molecules (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Bakelite" title="Bakelite">bakelite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Epoxy" title="Epoxy">epoxy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a>). Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins, which are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_polymers" title="Organic polymers">organic polymers</a>. In 1600 BC, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesoamerican" title="Mesoamerican">Mesoamericans</a> used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines. Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk-proteins (<a href="/wiki/Casein" title="Casein">casein</a>) with lye.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_chemistry" title="Industrial chemistry">industrial chemistry</a> developed during the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, many materials were reported. The development of plastics also accelerated with <a href="/wiki/Charles_Goodyear" title="Charles Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>'s discovery of <a href="/wiki/Vulcanization" title="Vulcanization">vulcanization</a> to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Parkesine" title="Parkesine">Parkesine</a> is considered the first man-made plastic. The plastic material was patented by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Parkes" title="Alexander Parkes">Alexander Parkes</a>, In <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UK" title="UK">UK</a> in 1856. It was unveiled at <a href="/wiki/1862_International_Exhibition" title="1862 International Exhibition">the 1862 Great International Exhibition</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. <i>Parkesine</i> won a bronze medal at the 1862 <a href="/wiki/World%27s_fair" title="World's fair">World's fair</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. Parkesine was made from <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a> (the major component of plant cell walls) treated with <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a> as a solvent. The output of the process (commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin) could be dissolved in <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated. By incorporating pigments into the product, it could be made to resemble <a href="/wiki/Ivory" title="Ivory">ivory</a>.</p>
<p>In 1897, the Hanover, Germany mass printing press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards. The resultant horn-like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846–1940). The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose. In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as <a href="/wiki/Galalith" title="Galalith">galalith</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, <a href="/wiki/Bakelite" title="Bakelite">Bakelite</a>, the first fully synthetic thermoset, was reported by Belgian chemist <a href="/wiki/Leo_Baekeland" title="Leo Baekeland">Leo Baekeland</a> by using phenol and formaldehyde.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics, with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s (around <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>). Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were <a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" title="Polystyrene">polystyrene</a> (PS), first produced by <a href="/wiki/BASF" title="BASF">BASF</a> in the 1930s, and <a href="/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a> (PVC), first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s. In 1923, Durite Plastics Inc. was the first manufacturer of phenol-furfural resins. In 1933, <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" title="Polyethylene">polyethylene</a> was discovered by <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Chemical_Industries" title="Imperial Chemical Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI) researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett.</p>
<p>In 1954, <a href="/wiki/Polypropylene" title="Polypropylene">polypropylene</a> was discovered by <a href="/wiki/Giulio_Natta" title="Giulio Natta">Giulio Natta</a> and began to be manufactured in 1957.</p>
<p>In 1954, expanded polystyrene (used for building insulation, packaging, and cups) was invented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dow_Chemical" title="Dow Chemical">Dow Chemical</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate" title="Polyethylene terephthalate">Polyethylene terephthalate</a> (PET)'s discovery is credited to employees of the <a href="/wiki/Calico_Printers%27_Association" title="Calico Printers' Association">Calico Printers' Association</a> in the UK in 1941; it was licensed to <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont</a> for the USA and ICI otherwise, and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances, resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Composition">Composition</span></h2>
<p>Most plastics contain <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic</a> polymers. The vast majority of these polymers are based on chains of <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> atoms alone or with <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> as well. The backbone is that part of the chain on the main "path" linking a large number of repeat units together. To customize the properties of a plastic, different molecular groups "hang" from the backbone (usually they are "hung" as part of the monomers before the monomers are linked together to form the polymer chain). The structure of these "side chains" influence the properties of the polymer. This fine tuning of the repeating unit's molecular structure influences the properties of the polymer.</p>
<p>Most plastics contain other organic or <a href="/wiki/Inorganic_compound" title="Inorganic compound">inorganic compounds</a> blended in. The amount of additives ranges from zero percentage (for example in polymers used to wrap foods) to more than 50% for certain electronic applications. The average content of additives is 20% by weight of the polymer.</p>
<p>Many of the controversies associated with plastics are associated with the additives. <a href="/wiki/Organotin_chemistry" title="Organotin chemistry">Organotin compounds</a> are particularly toxic.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fillers">Fillers</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Filler_(materials)" title="Filler (materials)">Fillers</a> improve performance and/or reduce production costs. <a href="/wiki/Stabilizer_(chemistry)" title="Stabilizer (chemistry)">Stabilizing additives</a> include <a href="/wiki/Fire_retardant" title="Fire retardant">fire retardants</a> to lower the flammability of the material. Many plastics contain fillers, relatively inert and inexpensive materials that make the product cheaper by weight.</p>
<p>Typically fillers are mineral in origin, e.g., <a href="/wiki/Chalk" title="Chalk">chalk</a>. Some fillers are more chemically active and are called reinforcing agents. Other fillers include zinc oxide, wood flour, ivory dust, cellulose and starch.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Plasticizers">Plasticizers</span></h3>
<p>Since many organic polymers are too rigid for particular applications, they are blended with <a href="/wiki/Plasticizer" title="Plasticizer">plasticizers</a> (the largest group of additives), oily compounds that confer improved <a href="/wiki/Rheology" title="Rheology">rheology</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Colorants">Colorants</span></h3>
<p>Colorants are common additives, although their weight contribution is small.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<p>Plastics are usually classified by their <a href="/wiki/Chemical_structure" title="Chemical structure">chemical structure</a> of the polymer's backbone and <a href="/wiki/Side_chain" title="Side chain">side chains</a>. Some important groups in these classifications are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Acryl_group" title="Acryl group">acrylics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polyester" title="Polyester">polyesters</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silicones" title="Silicones">silicones</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyurethanes" title="Polyurethanes">polyurethanes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Halocarbon" title="Halocarbon">halogenated plastics</a>. Plastics can also be classified by the chemical process used in their synthesis, such as <a href="/wiki/Condensation_reaction" title="Condensation reaction">condensation</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyaddition" title="Polyaddition">polyaddition</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cross-link" title="Cross-link">cross-linking</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermoplastics_and_thermosetting_polymers">Thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers</span></h3>
<p>There are two types of plastics: <a href="/wiki/Thermoplastic" title="Thermoplastic">thermoplastics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thermosetting_polymer" title="Thermosetting polymer">thermosetting polymers</a>. Thermoplastics are the plastics that do not undergo chemical change in their composition when heated and can be molded again and again. Examples include <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" title="Polyethylene">polyethylene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polypropylene" title="Polypropylene">polypropylene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" title="Polystyrene">polystyrene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a>. Common thermoplastics range from 20,000 to 500,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit" title="Atomic mass unit">amu</a>, while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight. These chains are made up of many repeating molecular units, known as <i>repeat units</i>, derived from <i><a href="/wiki/Monomer" title="Monomer">monomers</a></i>; each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units.</p>
<p>Thermosets can melt and take shape once; after they have solidified, they stay solid. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber is a thermosetting process. Before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material, but after vulcanization the product is rigid and non-tacky.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_classifications">Other classifications</span></h3>
<p>Other classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or <a href="/wiki/Product_design" title="Product design">product design</a>. Examples of such classes are the thermoplastic and thermoset, <a href="/wiki/Elastomer" title="Elastomer">elastomer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineering_plastic" title="Engineering plastic">structural</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic" title="Biodegradable plastic">biodegradable</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_resistance" title="Electrical resistance">electrically conductive</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bakelite">Bakelite</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Bakelite" title="Bakelite">Bakelite</a></div>
<p>The first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from <a href="/wiki/Phenol" title="Phenol">phenol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a>, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leo_Hendrik_Baekeland" title="Leo Hendrik Baekeland">Leo Hendrik Baekeland</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Belgian-American" title="Belgian-American">Belgian-born American</a> living in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_state" title="New York state">New York state</a>. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant "composite" materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in a meeting of the American Chemical Society. Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" title="Polystyrene">Polystyrene</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PVC" title="PVC">PVC</a></div>

<p>Unplasticised polystyrene is a rigid, brittle, inexpensive plastic that has been used to make <a href="/wiki/Plastic_model" title="Plastic model">plastic model</a> kits and similar knick-knacks. It also is the basis for some of the most popular "foamed" plastics, under the name <i>styrene foam</i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Styrofoam" title="Styrofoam">Styrofoam</a></i>. Like most other foam plastics, foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an "open cell" form, in which the foam bubbles are interconnected, as in an absorbent sponge, and "closed cell", in which all the bubbles are distinct, like tiny balloons, as in gas-filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late 1950s, <i>high impact</i> styrene was introduced, which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Polyvinyl_chloride">Polyvinyl chloride</span></h3>

<p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC, commonly called "vinyl") incorporates chlorine atoms. The C-Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation (and burning). PVC is stiff, strong, heat and weather resistant, properties that recommend its use in devices for <a href="/wiki/Plumbing" title="Plumbing">plumbing</a>, gutters, house siding, enclosures for computers and other electronics gear. PVC can also be softened with chemical processing, and in this form it is now used for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shrinkwrap" title="Shrinkwrap">shrink-wrap</a>, food packaging, and rain gear.</p>
<p>All PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light. When this happens, hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs. Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid, polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mylar" title="Mylar">mylar</a> is preferable).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nylon">Nylon</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Nylon" title="Nylon">Nylon</a></div>
<p>The plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of <a href="/wiki/Polyamide" title="Polyamide">polyamide</a> (PA), far better known by its trade name <b>nylon</b>. Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber, introduced by <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont Corporation</a> at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1939_World%27s_Fair" title="1939 World's Fair">1939 World's Fair</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>.</p>
<p>In 1927, DuPont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber66, under the direction of Harvard chemist <a href="/wiki/Wallace_Carothers" title="Wallace Carothers">Wallace Carothers</a> and chemistry department director <a href="/wiki/Elmer_Keiser_Bolton" title="Elmer Keiser Bolton">Elmer Keiser Bolton</a>. Carothers had been hired to perform pure research, and he worked to understand the new materials' molecular structure and physical properties. He took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials.</p>
<p>His work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber, which was very strong but also very flexible. The first application was for bristles for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toothbrushes" title="Toothbrushes">toothbrushes</a>. However, Du Pont's real target was <a href="/wiki/Silk" title="Silk">silk</a>, particularly silk <a href="/wiki/Stocking" title="Stocking">stockings</a>. Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide 6.6 and 4.6, as well as polyesters.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>It took DuPont twelve years and US$27 million to refine nylon, and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture. With such a major investment, it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction, creating a public sensation, or "nylon mania".</p>
<p>Nylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The production capacity that had been built up to produce <a href="/wiki/Pantyhose" title="Pantyhose">nylon stockings</a>, or just <i>nylons</i>, for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called <a href="/wiki/Nylon_riots" title="Nylon riots">nylon riots</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently polyamides 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds; e.g. <a href="/wiki/Caprolactam" title="Caprolactam">caprolactam</a>. Nylon 66 is a material manufactured by <a href="/wiki/Step-growth_polymerization" title="Step-growth polymerization">condensation polymerization</a>.</p>
<p>Nylons still remain important plastics, and not just for use in fabrics. In its bulk form it is very wear resistant, particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is used to build gears, <a href="/wiki/Plain_bearing" title="Plain bearing">plain bearings</a>, valve seats, seals and because of good heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and other mechanical parts.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rubber">Rubber</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Natural_rubber" title="Natural rubber">Natural rubber</a> is an elastomer (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) that originally was derived from <i><a href="/wiki/Latex" title="Latex">latex</a></i>, a milky <a href="/wiki/Colloid" title="Colloid">colloidal suspension</a> found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Goodyear" title="Charles Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a> invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (<a href="/wiki/Vulcanization" title="Vulcanization">vulcanization</a>), improving elasticity and durability.</p>
<p>In 1851, Nelson Goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form <a href="/wiki/Ebonite" title="Ebonite">ebonite</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Synthetic_rubber">Synthetic rubber</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_rubber" title="Synthetic rubber">Synthetic rubber</a></div>
<p>The first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sergei_Vasiljevich_Lebedev" title="Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev">Sergei Lebedev</a> in 1910. In World War II, supply blockades of natural rubber from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/South_East_Asia" title="South East Asia">South East Asia</a> caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber, notably <a href="/wiki/Styrene-butadiene" title="Styrene-butadiene">styrene-butadiene rubber</a>. In 1941, annual production of synthetic rubber in the U.S. was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840,000 tonnes in 1945. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_race" title="Space race">space race</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race" title="Nuclear arms race">nuclear arms race</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caltech" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets. Ultimately, all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels, and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties_of_plastics">Properties of plastics</span></h2>
<p>The properties of plastics are defined chiefly by the organic chemistry of the polymer such as hardness, density, and resistance to heat, organic solvents, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" title="Ionizing radiation">ionizing radiation</a>. In particular, most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">celsius</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Toxicity">Toxicity</span></h2>
<p>Pure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plasticizers" title="Plasticizers">plasticizers</a> like <a href="/wiki/Adipate" title="Adipate">adipates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phthalate" title="Phthalate">phthalates</a> are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toys" title="Toys">toys</a>, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> has restricted the use of <a href="/wiki/Bis(2-ethylhexyl)_phthalate" title="Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate">DEHP</a> (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, <a href="/wiki/Dibutyl_phthalate" title="Dibutyl phthalate">DPB</a>, <a href="/wiki/Benzyl_butyl_phthalate" title="Benzyl butyl phthalate">BBP</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diisononyl_phthalate" title="Diisononyl phthalate">DINP</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diisodecyl_phthalate" title="Diisodecyl phthalate">DIDP</a>, and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Di(n-octyl)_phthalate&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Di(n-octyl) phthalate (page does not exist)">DnOP</a> in children's toys and child care articles with the <a href="/wiki/Consumer_Product_Safety_Improvement_Act" title="Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act">Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act</a>. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include <a href="/wiki/Alkylphenol" title="Alkylphenol">alkylphenols</a>.</p>
<p>Whereas the finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic. In some cases, small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed. For example, the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s <a href="/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer" title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) has recognized <a href="/wiki/Vinyl_chloride" title="Vinyl chloride">vinyl chloride</a>, the precursor to PVC, as a human <a href="/wiki/Carcinogen" title="Carcinogen">carcinogen</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bisphenol_A">Bisphenol A</span></h3>
<p>Some polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated. In 2011, it was reported that "almost all plastic products" sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity, although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity.</p>
<p>The primary building block of <a href="/wiki/Polycarbonate" title="Polycarbonate">polycarbonates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bisphenol_A" title="Bisphenol A">bisphenol A</a> (BPA), is an <a href="/wiki/Estrogen" title="Estrogen">estrogen</a>-like <a href="/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor" title="Endocrine disruptor">endocrine disruptor</a> that may leach into food. Research in <a href="/wiki/Environmental_Health_Perspectives" title="Environmental Health Perspectives">Environmental Health Perspectives</a> finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans, <a href="/wiki/Dental_sealant" title="Dental sealant">dental sealants</a> and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals' offspring. A more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance, which can lead to inflammation and heart disease.</p>
<p>As of January 2010, the LA Times newspaper reports that the United States FDA is spending $30 million to investigate indications of BPA being linked to cancer.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bis(2-ethylhexyl)_adipate" title="Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate">Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate</a>, present in <a href="/wiki/Plastic_wrap" title="Plastic wrap">plastic wrap</a> based on PVC, is also of concern, as are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> present in <a href="/wiki/New_car_smell" title="New car smell">new car smell</a>.</p>
<p>The European Union has a permanent ban on the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phthalates" title="Phthalates">phthalates</a> in toys. In 2009, the United States government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s, one billion tons of plastic have been discarded and some of that material might persist for centuries or much longer, as is demonstrated by the persistence of natural materials such as amber.</p>
<p>Serious environmental threats from plastic have been suggested in the light of the increasing presence of <a href="/wiki/Microplastics" title="Microplastics">microplastics</a> in the marine food chain along with many highly toxic chemical pollutants that accumulate in plastics. They also accumulate in larger fragmented pieces of plastic called <a href="/wiki/Microplastics" title="Microplastics">nurdles</a>. In the 1960s the latter were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentration. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastics, although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile, 50-80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate_change">Climate change</span></h3>
<p>The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions.  Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Production_of_plastics">Production of plastics</span></h3>
<p>Production of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 <a href="/wiki/Joule#Megajoule" title="Joule">MJ</a> of energy per kilogram (taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of 35%). Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming: 230 to 235 MJ per 1 kilogram of silicon, and about 3,000 MJ per kilogram of semiconductors. This is much higher, compared to many other materials, e.g. production of iron from iron ore requires 20-25 MJ of energy, glass (from sand, etc.) - 18-35 MJ, steel (from iron) - 20-50 MJ, paper (from timber) - 25-50 MJ per kilogram.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Incineration_of_plastics">Incineration of plastics</span></h3>
<p>Controlled high-temperature <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incineration</a>, above 850C for two seconds, performed with selective additional heating, breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic, and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration. Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs as the heat content of the waste stream varies. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such <a href="/wiki/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxic</a> fumes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyrolytic_disposal">Pyrolytic disposal</span></h3>
<p>Plastics can be <a href="/wiki/Pyrolysis#Plastic_waste_disposal" title="Pyrolysis">pyrolyzed</a> into <a href="/wiki/Alkane" title="Alkane">hydrocarbon</a> fuels, since plastics have hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recycling">Recycling</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Plastic_recycling" title="Plastic recycling">Plastic recycling</a></div>
<p>Thermoplastics can be remelted and reused, and thermoset plastics can be ground up and used as filler, although the purity of the material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle. There are methods by which plastics can be broken back down to a feedstock state.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it <a href="/wiki/Labor_intensity" title="Labor intensity">labor-intensive</a>. Typically, workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code, although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable, which presents additional problems to the automated sorting process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.</p>
<p>While containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic, making them relatively easy to be sorted, a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics. In such cases, the resources it would take to separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However, developments are taking place in the field of <a href="/wiki/Active_Disassembly" title="Active Disassembly">active disassembly</a>, which may result in more consumer product components being re-used or recycled. Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable, as well. For example, polystyrene is rarely recycled because it is usually not cost effective. These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Landfills" title="Landfills">landfills</a>, <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incinerated</a> or used to produce electricity at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trash-to-energy_plant" title="Trash-to-energy plant">waste-to-energy</a> plants.</p>
<p>A first success in recycling of plastics is <a href="/wiki/Vinyloop" title="Vinyloop">Vinyloop</a>, a recycling process and an approach of the industry to separate PVC from other materials through a process of dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminations. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to recycle composite structure PVC waste which normally is being incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significant better ecological footprint. This process was used after the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the <a href="/wiki/Water_Polo_Arena" title="Water Polo Arena">Water Polo Arena</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Artillery_Barracks" title="Royal Artillery Barracks">Royal Artillery Barracks</a> were recycled. This way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games.</p>
<p>In 1988, to assist recycling of disposable items, the Plastic Bottle Institute of the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_the_Plastics_Industry" title="Society of the Plastics Industry">Society of the Plastics Industry</a> devised a now-familiar scheme to mark plastic bottles by plastic type. A plastic container using this scheme is marked with a triangle of three "<a href="/wiki/Recycling_symbol" title="Recycling symbol">chasing arrows</a>", which encloses a number giving the plastic type:</p>
