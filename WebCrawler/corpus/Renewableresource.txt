<p><a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">Water</a> can be considered a <i>renewable</i> material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed.

<p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.</p>
<p>Wild berries and other fruits, mushrooms, plants, seeds and naturally growing edible resources, still represent a valuable source of nutrition in many countries, especially in rural areas. In fact many wild animals are dependent on wild plants and fruits as a source of food.</p>
<p>Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.</p>

<p>The phrase <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture" title="Sustainable agriculture">sustainable agriculture</a> was coined by Australian agricultural scientist <a href="/wiki/Gordon_McClymont" title="Gordon McClymont">Gordon McClymont</a>. It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term". Expansion of agricultural land reduces <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and contributes to <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organisation" title="Food and Agriculture Organisation">Food and Agriculture Organisation</a> of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion.</p>

<p>Although <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> are available everywhere on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">crops</a> also depend on <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nutrients" title="Nutrients">nutrients</a> and the availability of <a href="/wiki/Water_resources" title="Water resources">water</a>. <a href="/wiki/Monoculture" title="Monoculture">Monoculture</a> is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced <a href="/wiki/Crop_yield" title="Crop yield">yields</a>. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogens</a> and pests that target one specific species. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Irish_Famine" title="Great Irish Famine">Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)</a> is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">Crop rotation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shifting_cultivation" title="Shifting cultivation">long-term crop rotations</a> confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of <a href="/wiki/Green_manure" title="Green manure">green manure</a> in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve <a href="/wiki/Soil_structure" title="Soil structure">soil structure</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertility_(soil)" title="Fertility (soil)">fertility</a> by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the <a href="/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile" title="Flooding of the Nile">Flooding of the Nile</a>, the long-term use of <a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">biochar</a>, and use of crop and livestock <a href="/wiki/Landrace" title="Landrace">landraces</a> that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.</p>
<p>Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">soil erosion</a> rates. It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates." The <a href="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" title="Dust Bowl">Dust Bowl</a> phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe <a href="/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">drought</a> combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, <a href="/wiki/Cover_crop" title="Cover crop">cover crops</a>, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent <a href="/wiki/Aeolian_processes" title="Aeolian processes">wind erosion</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Tillage" title="Tillage">tillage</a> of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_erosion" title="Water erosion">water erosion</a>. The phenomenon called <i>Peak Soil</i> describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are jeopardizing humanity's ability to grow food in the present and in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">arable soil</a> will become increasingly problematic.</p>
<p>Methods to combat erosion include <a href="/wiki/No-till_farming" title="No-till farming">no-till farming</a>, using a <a href="/wiki/Keyline_design" title="Keyline design">keyline design</a>, growing <a href="/wiki/Hedge" title="Hedge">wind breaks</a> to hold the soil, and widespread use of <a href="/wiki/Compost" title="Compost">compost</a>. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Chemical_fertiliser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Chemical fertiliser (page does not exist)">Chemical fertiliser</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a> can also have an effect of soil erosion, which can contribute to <a href="/wiki/Soil_salinity" title="Soil salinity">soil salinity</a> and prevent other species from growing. <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">Phosphate</a> is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that <i>Peak Phosphate</i> will occur in about 2030.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_process" title="Industrial process">Industrial processing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Logistics" title="Logistics">logistics</a> also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability.

<p>Historically, renewable resources like firewood, <a href="/wiki/Latex" title="Latex">latex</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guano" title="Guano">guano</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wood_ash" title="Wood ash">wood ash</a>, plant colors as <a href="/wiki/Indigo" title="Indigo">indigo</a>, and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era. Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Overgrazing" title="Overgrazing">overgrazing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Overfishing" title="Overfishing">overfishing</a>.</p>
<p>Besides fresh meat and milk, which is as a food item not topic of this section, <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as <a href="/wiki/Tendon" title="Tendon">tendons</a>, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the <a href="/wiki/Composite_bow" title="Composite bow">composite bow</a> were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as <a href="/wiki/Food_vs._fuel" title="Food vs. fuel">Food vs. fuel</a>. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by <a href="/wiki/Fief" title="Fief">fief</a> obligations were in so far common in historical times as well. However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a>, which provides as well organic fertiliser. Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes, drove engines as e.g. in <a href="/wiki/Treadmill" title="Treadmill">treadmills</a>.</p>
<p>Other regions solved the transportation problem with <a href="/wiki/Terrace_(agriculture)" title="Terrace (agriculture)">terracing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urban_agriculture" title="Urban agriculture">urban</a> and garden agriculture. Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution" title="British Agricultural Revolution">British Agricultural Revolution</a> was mainly based on a new system of <a href="/wiki/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">crop rotation</a>, the four-field rotation. <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> agriculturist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Townshend,_2nd_Viscount_Townshend" title="Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend">Charles Townshend</a> recognised the invention in Dutch <a href="/wiki/Waasland" title="Waasland">Waasland</a> and popularised it in the 18th century UK, <a href="/wiki/George_Washington_Carver" title="George Washington Carver">George Washington Carver</a> in the USA. The system used <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turnip" title="Turnip">turnips</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a> and introduced as well <a href="/wiki/Clover" title="Clover">clover</a>. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> could to be bred year-round and winter <a href="/wiki/Culling" title="Culling">culling</a> was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from <a href="/wiki/Wood_pasture" title="Wood pasture">wood pasture</a>.</p>
<p>Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively. Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">global shortage of fossil fuels</a>, local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.</p>

<p>However the former <a href="/wiki/Plant_breeding" title="Plant breeding">Plant breeding</a> research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the <a href="/wiki/German_colonial_empire" title="German colonial empire">German colonial empire</a>, important players in the field as <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Baur" title="Erwin Baur">Erwin Baur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Konrad_Meyer" title="Konrad Meyer">Konrad Meyer</a> switched to using local crops as base for economic <a href="/wiki/Autarky" title="Autarky">autarky</a>.

A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.</p>
<p>There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow <a href="/wiki/Hardiness_(plants)" title="Hardiness (plants)">frost resistant</a> olive species, but some success in the case of <a href="/wiki/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linum" title="Linum">Linum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rapeseed" title="Rapeseed">rapeseed</a>, which are still of current importance.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_situation_and_subsidies">Legal situation and subsidies</span></h3>
<p>Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables. The UK uses <a href="/wiki/Non-Fossil_Fuel_Obligation" title="Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation">Non-Fossil Fuel Obligations</a> (NFFO), a collection of <a href="/wiki/Statutory_Instrument" title="Statutory Instrument">orders</a> requiring the electricity <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Distribution_Network_Operator" title="Distribution Network Operator">Distribution Network Operators</a> in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> to purchase electricity from the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sectors.

In the USA, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Certificates" title="Renewable Energy Certificates">Renewable Energy Certificates</a> (RECs), use a similar approach. German <a href="/wiki/Energy_transition" title="Energy transition">Energiewende</a> is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare <a href="/wiki/Tilbury_power_stations" title="Tilbury power stations">Tilbury power stations</a>) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">Biomass</a> is referring to <a href="/wiki/Biomaterial" title="Biomaterial">biological material</a> from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.</p>
<p>Sustainable harvesting and use of renewable resources (i.e., maintaining a positive renewal rate) can reduce <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soil_contamination" title="Soil contamination">soil contamination</a>, <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Land_degradation" title="Land degradation">land degradation</a>. Biomass energy is derived from six distinct energy sources: garbage, wood, plants, waste, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Landfill_gases" title="Landfill gases">landfill gases</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alcohol_fuels" title="Alcohol fuels">alcohol fuels</a>. Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the advent of burning wood to make fire, and wood remains the largest biomass energy source today.</p>
<p>However, low tech use of biomass, which still amounts for more than 10% of world energy needs may induce <a href="/wiki/Indoor_air_pollution_in_developing_nations" title="Indoor air pollution in developing nations">indoor air pollution in developing nations</a> and results in between 1.5 million and 2 million deaths in 2000.</p>
<p>The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Agricultural waste is common in <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> (sugar cane residue) and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UK" title="UK">UK</a>. The biomass power generating industry in the United States, which consists of approximately 11,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a> of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid, produces about 1.4 percent of the U.S. electricity supply.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels" title="Biofuels">Biofuels</a></div>

<p>A biofuel is a type of <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a> whose energy is derived from biological <a href="/wiki/Carbon_fixation" title="Carbon fixation">carbon fixation</a>. Biofuels include fuels derived from <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a> conversion, as well as <a href="/wiki/Biofuel#Solid_biofuels" title="Biofuel">solid biomass</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liquid_fuels" title="Liquid fuels">liquid fuels</a> and various <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogases</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioethanol" title="Bioethanol">Bioethanol</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> made by <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation" title="Ethanol fermentation">fermentation</a>, mostly from <a href="/wiki/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a> produced in <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> or <a href="/wiki/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a> crops such as <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Switchgrass" title="Switchgrass">switchgrass</a>.</p>

Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a> and is the most common biofuel in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">Biogas</a> is <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> produced by the process of <a href="/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion" title="Anaerobic digestion">anaerobic digestion</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_material" title="Organic material">organic material</a> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anaerobe" title="Anaerobe">anaerobes</a>., etc. is also a renewable source of energy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biogas">Biogas</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">Biogas</a> typically refers to a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a> produced by the breakdown of <a href="/wiki/Organic_matter" title="Organic matter">organic matter</a> in the absence of <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. Biogas is produced by <a href="/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion" title="Anaerobic digestion">anaerobic digestion</a> with anaerobic bacteria or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)" title="Fermentation (biochemistry)">fermentation</a> of biodegradable materials such as <a href="/wiki/Manure" title="Manure">manure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Municipal_waste" title="Municipal waste">municipal waste</a>, <a href="/wiki/Green_waste" title="Green waste">green waste</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plant_material" title="Plant material">plant material</a>, and crops.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Natural_fiber" title="Natural fiber">Natural fiber</a></div>
<p>Natural fibres are a class of hair-like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces, similar to pieces of <a href="/wiki/Yarn" title="Yarn">thread</a>. They can be used as a component of <a href="/wiki/Composite_material" title="Composite material">composite</a> materials. They can also be <a href="/wiki/Felted" title="Felted">matted</a> into sheets to make products such as <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a> or <a href="/wiki/Felt" title="Felt">felt</a>. Fibres are of two types: natural fibre which consists of animal and plant fibres, and man made fibre which consists of synthetic fibres and regenerated fibres.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats_to_renewable_resources">Threats to renewable resources</span></h2>
<p>Renewable resources are endangered by non-regulated industrial developments and growth. They must be carefully managed to avoid exceeding the natural world's capacity to replenish them. A life cycle assessment provides a systematic means of evaluating renewability. This is a matter of sustainability in the natural environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overfishing">Overfishing</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Overfishing" title="Overfishing">Overfishing</a></div>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/National_Geographic_(magazine)" title="National Geographic (magazine)">National Geographic</a></i> has described ocean over fishing as "simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace themselves."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tuna" title="Tuna">Tuna</a> meat is driving overfishing as to endanger some species like the bluefin tuna. The European Community and other organisations are trying to regulate fishery as to protect species and to prevent their extinctions. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" title="United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> treaty deals with aspects of overfishing in articles 61, 62, and 65.</p>
<p>Examples of overfishing exist in areas such as the <a href="/wiki/Fishing_in_the_North_Sea" title="Fishing in the North Sea">North Sea</a> of <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Banks_of_Newfoundland" title="Grand Banks of Newfoundland">Grand Banks</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and the <a href="/wiki/East_China_Sea" title="East China Sea">East China Sea</a> of Asia.</p>
<p>The decline of <a href="/wiki/Penguin" title="Penguin">penguin</a> population is caused in part by overfishing, caused by human competition over the same renewable resources</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deforestation">Deforestation</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">Deforestation</a></div>

<p>Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen. The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, which is better known as the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a>.</p>
<p>Deforestation also affects the water cycle. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that <a href="/wiki/Soil_erosion" title="Soil erosion">erosion</a>, flooding and <a href="/wiki/Landslide" title="Landslide">landslides</a> ensue.</p>
<p>Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities. In this way biofuels may well be unsustainable if their production contributes to deforestation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Endangered_species">Endangered species</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">Endangered species</a></div>
<p>Some renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct. Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The <a href="/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a> is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biodiversity_Action_Plan" title="Biodiversity Action Plan">Biodiversity Action Plans</a> to protect endangered and other threatened species.</p>
