<p>Although the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> has legislated in the area of <a href="/wiki/Energy_policy" title="Energy policy">energy policy</a> for many years, the concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive <b>European Union energy policy</b> was only approved at the meeting of the informal <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> on 27 October 2005 at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hampton_Court" title="Hampton Court">Hampton Court</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">EU Treaty of Lisbon</a> of 2007 legally includes solidarity in matters of energy supply and changes to the energy policy within the EU. Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, EU energy legislation has been based on the EU authority in the area of the common market and environment. However, in practice many policy competencies in relation to energy remain at national member state level, and progress in policy at European level requires voluntary cooperation by members states.</p>
<p>In 2007, the EU was importing 82% of its <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and 57% of its <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">gas</a>, which then made it the world's leading importer of these <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fuels" title="Fuels">fuels</a>. Only 3% of the <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> used in European nuclear reactors was <a href="/wiki/Uranium_mining" title="Uranium mining">mined</a> in Europe. Russia, Canada, Australia, Niger and Kazakhstan were the five largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the EU, supplying more than 75% of the total needs in 2009. In 2015, the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes. In January 2014, the EU agreed to a 40% emissions reduction by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and a 27% renewable energy target. The target is the most ambitious of any region in the world, and is expected to provide 70,000 full-time jobs and cut €33bn in fossil fuel imports.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Framework Strategy for Energy Union is launched as one of the European Commission's 10 Priorities.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_Union">Energy Union</span></h2>
<p>The Energy Union Strategy is a project of the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> to coordinate the transformation of European energy supply. It was launched in February 2015, with the aim of providing secure, sustainable, competitive, affordable energy.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Donald_Tusk" title="Donald Tusk">Donald Tusk</a>, President of the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a>, introduced the idea of an energy union when he was Prime Minister of Poland. Eurocommissioner Vice President <a href="/wiki/Maro%C5%A1_%C5%A0ef%C4%8Dovi%C4%8D" title="Maroš Šefčovič">Maroš Šefčovič</a> called the Energy Union the biggest energy project since the <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="European Coal and Steel Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a>. The EU's reliance on Russia for its energy, and the <a href="/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation" title="Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation">annexation of Crimea by Russia</a> have been cited as strong reasons for the importance of this policy.</p>
<p>The European Council concluded on 19<span class="nowrap"> </span>March 2015 that the EU is committed to building an Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the Commission's framework strategy, with five priority dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy security, solidarity and trust</li>
<li>A fully integrated European <a href="/wiki/Energy_market" title="Energy market">energy market</a></li>
<li>Energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand</li>
<li>Decarbonising the economy</li>
<li>Research, innovation and competitiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The strategy includes a minimum 10% electricity interconnection target for all member states by 2020, which the Commission hopes will put downward pressure onto energy prices, reduce the need to build new power plants, reduce the risk of black-outs or other forms of <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">electrical grid</a> <a href="/wiki/Instability" title="Instability">instability</a>, improve the reliability of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> <a href="/wiki/Supply_(economics)" title="Supply (economics)">supply</a>, and encourage <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">market</a> <a href="/wiki/Economic_integration" title="Economic integration">integration</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Earlier_proposals">Earlier proposals</span></h2>
<p>The possible principles of Energy Policy for Europe were elaborated at the Commission's <a href="/wiki/Green_paper" title="Green paper">green paper</a> <i>A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy</i> on 8 March 2006. As a result of the decision to develop a common energy policy, the first proposals, <i>Energy for a Changing World</i> were published by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, following a consultation process, on 10 January 2007.</p>
<p>It is claimed that they will lead to a 'post-industrial revolution', or a <a href="/wiki/Low-carbon_economy" title="Low-carbon economy">low-carbon economy</a>, in the European Union, as well as increased competition in the energy markets, improved security of supply, and improved employment prospects. The Commission's proposals have been approved at a meeting of the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> on 8 and 9 March 2007.</p>
<p>Key proposals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cut of at least 20% in <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions from all <a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a> sources by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), while pushing for an international agreement to succeed the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> aimed at achieving a 30% cut by all developed nations by 2020.</li>
<li>A cut of up to 95% in carbon emissions from primary energy sources by 2050, compared to 1990 levels.</li>
<li>A minimum target of 10% for the use of <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a> by 2020.</li>
<li>That the energy supply and generation activities of energy companies should be 'unbundled' from their distribution networks to further increase market competition.</li>
<li>Improving energy relations with the EU's neighbours, including Russia.</li>
<li>The development of a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to develop technologies in areas including renewable energy, <a href="/wiki/Energy_conservation" title="Energy conservation">energy conservation</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low-energy_building" title="Low-energy building">low-energy buildings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">fourth generation nuclear reactor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clean_coal" title="Clean coal">clean coal</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_sequestration" title="Carbon capture and sequestration">carbon capture and sequestration</a> (CCS).</li>
<li>Developing an <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>-<a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> Energy partnership, to help Africa 'leap-frog' to low-carbon technologies and to help develop the continent as a sustainable energy supplier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many underlying proposals are designed to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, of which 0.8 °C has already taken place and another 0.5–0.7 °C is already <a href="/wiki/Climate_commitment" title="Climate commitment">committed</a>. 2 °C is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid '<a href="/wiki/Global_warming#Defining_dangerous_global_warming" title="Global warming">dangerous global warming</a>'. Due to only minor efforts in global <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">Climate change mitigation</a> it is highly likely that the world will not be able to reach this particular target. The EU might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target. Because the planned emissions reductions in the European energy sector (95% by 2050) are derived directly from the 2 °C target since 2007, the EU will have to revise its energy policy paradigm.</p>
<p>In 2014, negotiations about binding EU energy and climate targets until 2030 are set to start. European Parliament voted in February 2014 in favour of binding 2030 targets on renewables, emissions and energy efficiency: a 40% cut in greenhouse gases, compared with 1990 levels; at least 30% of energy to come from renewable sources; and a 40% improvement in energy efficiency.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="SET_Plan">SET Plan</span></h3>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seventh_Framework_Programme" title="Seventh Framework Programme">FP7</a> research program only reserved a moderate amount of funding for energy research, although energy has recently emerged as one of the key issues of the European Union. A large part of FP7 energy funding is also devoted to <a href="/wiki/Fusion_power" title="Fusion power">fusion</a> research, a technology that will not be able to help meet European climate and energy objectives until beyond 2050. The European Commission tried to redress this shortfall with the SET plan.</p>
<p>The Steering Group on the implementation of the Strategic Energy Technologies Plan (SET Plan) on 26 June 2008 will set the agenda for an EU energy technology policy. It will enhance the coordination of national and European research and innovation efforts to position the EU in the forefront of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low-carbon" title="Low-carbon">low-carbon</a> technologies markets.</p>
<p>The SET plan initiatives:</p>

<p>The budget for the SET plan is estimated at €71 billion.</p>

Although there is significant variation in national targets, the average is that 22% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2010 (compared to 13,9% in 1997). The European Commission has proposed in its Renewable Energy Roadmap21 a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020.</p>
<p>Europe spent on importing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a> €406 billion in 2011 (bn) and €545 bn in 2012. This is around three times more than the cost of the <a href="/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Facility#Greek_bailout" title="European Financial Stability Facility">Greek bailout</a> up to 2013. In 2012, wind energy avoided €9.6 billion (bn) of fossil fuel costs. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EWEA" title="EWEA">EWEA</a> recommends binding renewable energy target to support in replacing fossil fuels with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy_in_Europe" title="Wind energy in Europe">wind energy in Europe</a> by providing a stable regulatory framework.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Buildings">Buildings</span></h3>
<p>Buildings account for around 40% of EU energy requirements and have been the focus of several initiatives. From 4 January 2006, the 2002 <a href="/wiki/Directive_on_the_energy_performance_of_buildings" title="Directive on the energy performance of buildings">Directive on the energy performance of buildings</a> requires member states to ensure that new buildings, as well as large existing building undergoing refurbishment, meet certain minimum energy requirements. It also requires that all buildings should undergo 'energy certification' prior to sale, and that <a href="/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boilers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioning" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a> equipment should be regularly inspected.</p>
<p>As part of the EU's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SAVE_Programme" title="SAVE Programme">SAVE Programme</a>, aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour, the Boiler Efficiency Directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for <a href="/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boilers</a> fired with liquid or gaseous fuels.

<p><a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">Carbon dioxide</a> emissions from transport have risen rapidly in recent years, from 21% of the total in 1990 to 28% in 2004.</p>
<p>EU policies include the voluntary <a href="/wiki/ACEA_agreement" title="ACEA agreement">ACEA agreement</a>, signed in 1998, to cut carbon dioxide emissions for new cars sold in Europe to an average of 140 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>/km by 2008, a 25% cut from the 1995 level. Because the target was unlikely to be met, the European Commission published new proposals in February 2007, requiring a mandatory limit of 130 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>/km for new cars by 2012, with 'complementary measures' being proposed to achieve the target of 120 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>/km that had originally been expected.</p>
<p>In the area of fuels, the 2001 <a href="/wiki/Directive_on_the_Promotion_of_the_use_of_biofuels_and_other_renewable_fuels_for_transport" title="Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport">Biofuels Directive</a> requires that 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (petrol and <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel</a>) should be replaced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels" title="Biofuels">biofuels</a> by 31 December 2010, with an intermediate target of 2% by the end of 2005. In February 2007 the European Commission proposed that, from 2011, suppliers will have to reduce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> per unit of energy by 1% a year from 2010 levels, to result in a cut of 10% by 2020 Stricter fuel standards to combat climate change and reduce air pollution.</p>

<p>Beyond the bounds of the European Union, EU energy policy has included negotiating and developing wider international agreements, such as the <a href="/wiki/Energy_Charter_Treaty" title="Energy Charter Treaty">Energy Charter Treaty</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>, the post-Kyoto regime and a framework agreement on energy efficiency; extension of the EC energy regulatory framework or principles to neighbours (<a href="/wiki/Energy_Community" title="Energy Community">Energy Community</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baku_Initiative" title="Baku Initiative">Baku Initiative</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Euro-Mediterranean_Partnership" title="Euro-Mediterranean Partnership">Euro-Med</a> energy cooperation) and the emission trading scheme to global partners; the promotion of research and the use of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The EU-Russia energy cooperation will be based on a new comprehensive framework agreement within the post-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Partnership_and_Cooperation_Agreement" title="Partnership and Cooperation Agreement">Partnership and Cooperation Agreement</a> (PCA), which will be negotiated in 2007. The energy cooperation with other third energy producer and transit countries is facilitated with different tools, such as the PCAs, the existing and foreseen Memorandums of Understanding on Energy Cooperation (with Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Algeria), the Association Agreements with Mediterranean countries, the <a href="/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy" title="European Neighbourhood Policy">European Neighbourhood Policy</a> Action Plans; Euromed energy cooperation; the Baku initiative; and the EU-Norway energy dialogue. For the cooperation with African countries, a comprehensive Africa-Europe Energy partnership would be launched at the highest level, with the integration of Europe's Energy and Development Policies.</p>
<p>For ensuring efficient follow-up and coherence in pursuing the initiatives and processes, for sharing information in case of an external energy crisis, and for assisting the EU's early response and reactions in case of energy security threats, the network of energy correspondents in the Member States was established in early 2007. After the Russian-Ukrainian Gas Crisis of 2009 the EU decided that the existing external measures regarding gas supply security should be supplemented by internal provisions for emergency prevention and response, such as enhancing gas storage and network capacity or the development of the technical prerequisites for reverse flow in transit pipelines.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Policies_under_development">Policies under development</span></h2>
<p>Documents leaked in late-2016 reveal that a confidential <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> impact assessment analyzes four scenarios for paring back the 'priority dispatch' system afforded to renewable generation in many countries.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Research_and_development">Research and development</span></h2>
<p>The European Union is also active in the areas of energy research, development and promotion, via initiatives such as <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=CEPHEUS&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="CEPHEUS (page does not exist)">CEPHEUS</a> (ultra-low energy housing), and programs under the umbrella titles of SAVE (energy saving) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ALTENER" title="ALTENER">ALTENER</a> (new and renewable energy sources), <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/STEER" title="STEER">STEER</a> (transport) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COOPENER" title="COOPENER">COOPENER</a> (developing countries).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_opinion">Public opinion</span></h2>
<p>In a poll carried out for the European Commission in October and November 2005, 47% of the citizens questioned in the 27 countries of the EU (including the 2 states that joined in 2007) were in favour of taking decisions on key energy policy issues at a European level. 37% favoured national decisions and 8% that they be tackled locally.</p>
<p>A similar survey of 29,220 people in March and May 2006 indicated that the balance had changed in favour of national decisions in these areas (42% in favour), with 39% backing EU policy making and 12% preferring local decisions. There was significant national variation with this, with 55% in favour in the Netherlands, but only 15% in Finland.</p>
<p>A comprehensive public opinion survey was performed in May and June 2006. The authors propose following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy issues are considered to be important but not at first glance.</li>
<li>EU citizens perceive great future promise in the use of renewable energies. Despite majority opposition, nuclear energy also has its place in the future <a href="/wiki/Energy_mix" title="Energy mix">energy mix</a>.</li>
<li>Citizens appear to opt for changing the energy structure, enhancing research and development and guaranteeing the stability of the energy field rather than saving energy as the way to meet energy challenges.</li>
<li>The possible future consequences of energy issues do not generate deep fears in Europeans’ minds.</li>
<li>Europeans appear to be fairly familiar with energy issues, although their knowledge seems somewhat vague.</li>
<li>Energy issues touch everybody and it is therefore hard to distinguish clear groups with differing perceptions. Nevertheless, rough distinction between groups of citizens is sketched.</li>
