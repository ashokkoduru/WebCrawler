<p>There is evidence of urban planning and designed communities dating back to the <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamian</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minoan_Civilization" title="Minoan Civilization">Minoan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> civilizations in the third millennium BCE. Archeologists studying the ruins of cities in these areas find paved streets that were laid out at right angles in a grid pattern. The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it. Beginning in the 8th century BCE, Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal (or grid-like) plans. The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Romans</a>, inspired by the Greeks, also used orthogonal plans for their cities. City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience. The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning. As the Roman Empire declined, these ideas slowly disappeared. However, many cities in Europe still held onto the planned Roman city center. Cities in Europe from the 9th to 14th centuries, often grew organically and sometimes chaotically. But many hundreds of new towns were newly built according to preconceived plans, and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions. Most of these were realized from the 12th to 14th centuries, with a peak-period at the end of the 13th. From the 15th century on, much more is recorded of urban design and the people that were involved. In this period, theoretical treatises on architecture and urban planning start to appear in which theoretical questions are addressed and designs of towns and cities are described and depicted. During the Enlightenment period, several European rulers ambitiously attempted to redesign capital cities. During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_French_Republic" title="Second French Republic">Second French Republic</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baron_Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne_Haussmann" title="Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann">Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann</a>, under the direction of <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_III" title="Napoleon III">Napoleon III</a>, redesigned the city of <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> into a more modern capital, with long, straight, wide boulevards.</p>
<p>Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century. The industrialized cities of the 19th century grew at a tremendous rate. The pace and style of this industrial construction was largely dictated by the concerns of private business. The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The <a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>, was starting to give way to a <a href="/wiki/Social_liberalism" title="Social liberalism">New Liberalism</a> that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_age" title="Industrial age">industrial age</a>, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.</p>
<p>Urban planning started to become professionalized during this time. The <a href="/wiki/Town_and_Country_Planning_Association" title="Town and Country Planning Association">Town and Country Planning Association</a> was founded in 1899 and the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Liverpool" title="University of Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a> in 1909. In the 1920s, the ideas of <a href="/wiki/Modernism" title="Modernism">modernism</a> and uniformity began to surface in urban planning, and lasted until the 1970s. Many planners started to believe that the ideas of modernism in urban planning led to higher crime rates and social problems. Urban planners now focus more on individualism and diversity in urban centers.</p>

<p><b>Planning Theory</b> is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach.</p>

<p>An <b>urban planner</b> is a professional who works in the field of urban planning for the purpose of optimizing the effectiveness of a community's land use and infrastructure. They formulate plans for the development and management of urban and suburban areas, typically analyzing land use compatibility as well as economic, environmental and social trends. In developing the plan for a community (whether commercial, residential, agricultural, natural or recreational), urban planners must also consider a wide array of issues such as sustainability, air pollution, traffic congestion, crime, land values, legislation and <a href="/wiki/Zoning" title="Zoning">zoning</a> codes.</p>
<p>The importance of the urban planner is increasing throughout the 21st century, as modern society begins to face issues of increased population growth, climate change and unsustainable development. An urban planner could be considered a <a href="/wiki/Green-collar_worker" title="Green-collar worker">green collar</a> professional.</p>
