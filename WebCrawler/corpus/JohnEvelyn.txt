<p><b>John Evelyn</b>, <a href="/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" title="Fellow of the Royal Society">FRS</a> (31 October 1620 – 27 February 1706) was an English writer, gardener and <a href="/wiki/Diary" title="Diary">diarist</a>.</p>
<p>Evelyn's <a href="/wiki/Diary" title="Diary">diaries</a>, or memoirs, are largely contemporaneous with those of his rival diarist, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Pepys" title="Samuel Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>, and cast considerable light on the art, culture and politics of the time (the deaths of <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, the last <a href="/wiki/Great_Plague_of_London" title="Great Plague of London">Great Plague of London</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Great_Fire_of_London" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire of London</a> in 1666).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography">Biography</span></h2>



<p>Born into a family whose wealth was largely founded on <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> production, John Evelyn was born in <a href="/wiki/Wotton,_Surrey" title="Wotton, Surrey">Wotton, Surrey</a> and grew up in <a href="/wiki/Lewes" title="Lewes">Lewes, Sussex</a>. While living in Lewes, in Southover Grange, he was educated at <a href="/wiki/Lewes_Old_Grammar_School" title="Lewes Old Grammar School">Lewes Old Grammar School</a>. After this he was educated at <a href="/wiki/Balliol_College,_Oxford" title="Balliol College, Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, and at the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Temple" title="Middle Temple">Middle Temple</a>. In London, he witnessed important events such as the trials and executions of <a href="/wiki/William_Howard,_1st_Viscount_Stafford" title="William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford">William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford" title="Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford">Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford</a>.  Having briefly joined the <a href="/wiki/Cavalier" title="Cavalier">Royalist</a> army and arrived too late for the Royalist victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Brentford_(1642)" title="Battle of Brentford (1642)">Battle of Brentford</a> in 1642, he went abroad to avoid further involvement in the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>In October 1644 Evelyn visited the Roman ruins in <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9jus" title="Fréjus">Fréjus</a>, Provence, before travelling on to Italy. He attended anatomy lectures in <a href="/wiki/Padua" title="Padua">Padua</a> in 1646 and sent the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Evelyn_Tables" title="Evelyn Tables">Evelyn Tables</a> back to London. These are thought to be the oldest surviving anatomical preparations in Europe; Evelyn later gave them to the Royal Society, and they are now in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hunterian_Museum" title="Hunterian Museum">Hunterian Museum</a>. In 1644, Evelyn visited the <a href="/wiki/English_College,_Rome" title="English College, Rome">English College</a> at Rome, where Catholic priests were trained for service in England. In the Veneto he renewed his acquaintance with the famous art collector <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Howard,_21st_Earl_of_Arundel" title="Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel">Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel</a> and toured the art collections of Venice with <a href="/wiki/Henry_Howard,_6th_Duke_of_Norfolk" title="Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk">Arundel's grandson and heir</a>, later <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Norfolk" title="Duke of Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>. He acquired an ancient Egyptian stela and sent a sketch back to Rome, which was published by <a href="/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher" title="Athanasius Kircher">Father Kircher, SJ</a> in Kircher's <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> (1650), albeit without acknowledgement to Evelyn.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> he commissioned the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Evelyn_Cabinet" title="John Evelyn Cabinet">John Evelyn Cabinet</a> (1644–46), an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Ebony" title="Ebony">ebony</a> cabinet with <a href="/wiki/Pietra_dura" title="Pietra dura">pietra dura</a> and gilt-bronze panels, which is now in the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum" title="Victoria and Albert Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. It was in his London house at his death, then returned to Wotton, and is very likely the "ebony cabinet" in which his diaries were later found.</p>
<p>He married Mary Browne, daughter of <a href="/wiki/Sir_Richard_Browne,_1st_Baronet,_of_Deptford" title="Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of Deptford">Sir Richard Browne</a> the English ambassador in Paris in 1647.</p>
<p>In 1652, Evelyn and his wife settled in <a href="/wiki/Deptford" title="Deptford">Deptford</a> (present-day south-east London). Their house, <a href="/wiki/Sayes_Court" title="Sayes Court">Sayes Court</a> (adjacent to the <a href="/wiki/Deptford_Dockyard" title="Deptford Dockyard">naval dockyard</a>), was purchased by Evelyn from his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, in 1653; Evelyn soon began to transform the gardens. In 1671, he encountered master wood-worker <a href="/wiki/Grinling_Gibbons" title="Grinling Gibbons">Grinling Gibbons</a> (who was renting a cottage on the Sayes Court estate) and introduced him to Sir <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Wren" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a>. There is now an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wards_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Wards of the United Kingdom">electoral ward</a> called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Evelyn,_London" title="Evelyn, London">Evelyn</a> in <a href="/wiki/Deptford" title="Deptford">Deptford, London Borough of Lewisham</a>. It was after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/English_Restoration" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> that Evelyn's career really took off. In 1660, Evelyn was a member of the group that founded the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a>. The following year, he wrote the <i><a href="/wiki/Fumifugium" title="Fumifugium">Fumifugium</a></i> (or <i>The Inconveniencie of the Aer and Smoak of London Dissipated</i>), the first book written on the growing air pollution problem in London.</p>
<p>He was known for his knowledge of trees, and had a friend and correspondent, <a href="/wiki/Philip_Dumaresq" title="Philip Dumaresq">Philip Dumaresq</a>, who "devoted most of his time to gardening, fruit, and tree culture." Evelyn's treatise, <i><a href="/wiki/Sylva,_or_A_Discourse_of_Forest-Trees_and_the_Propagation_of_Timber" title="Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber">Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees</a></i> (1664), was written as an encouragement to landowners to plant trees to provide timber for England's burgeoning navy. Further editions appeared in his lifetime (1670 and 1679), with the fourth edition (1706) appearing just after his death and featuring the engraving of Evelyn shown on this page (below) even though it had been made more than 50 years prior by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Nanteuil" title="Robert Nanteuil">Robert Nanteuil</a> in 1651 in Paris. Various other editions appeared in the 18th and 19th centuries and feature an inaccurate portrait of Evelyn made by <a href="/wiki/Francesco_Bartolozzi" title="Francesco Bartolozzi">Francesco Bartolozzi</a>.</p>

<p>Evelyn had some training as a draftsman and artist, and created several <a href="/wiki/Etching" title="Etching">etchings</a>. Most of his published work, produced in the form of drawings to be engraved by others, was to illustrate his own work. During the <a href="/wiki/Second_Anglo-Dutch_War" title="Second Anglo-Dutch War">Second Anglo-Dutch War</a>, beginning 28 October 1664, Evelyn served as one of four <a href="/wiki/Sick_and_Hurt_Commissioners" title="Sick and Hurt Commissioners">Commissioners for taking Care of Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War</a> (others included <a href="/wiki/D%27Oyly_baronets" title="D'Oyly baronets">Sir William D'Oyly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Clifford,_1st_Baron_Clifford_of_Chudleigh" title="Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh">Sir Thomas Clifford</a>).</p>

<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Great_Fire_of_London" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire</a> in 1666, closely described in his diaries, Evelyn presented the first of several plans (<a href="/wiki/Christopher_Wren" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a> produced another) for the rebuilding of London, all of which were rejected by <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> largely due to the complexities of land ownership in the city. He took an interest in the rebuilding of <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> by Wren (with Gibbons' artistry a notable addition). Evelyn's interest in gardens even led him to design pleasure gardens, such as those at <a href="/wiki/Euston_Hall" title="Euston Hall">Euston Hall</a>.</p>
<p>Evelyn was a prolific author and produced books on subjects as diverse as theology, numismatics, politics, horticulture, architecture and vegetarianism, and he cultivated links with contemporaries across the spectrum of Stuart political and cultural life. In September 1671 he travelled with the Royal court of <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> to Norwich where he called upon Sir <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Browne" title="Thomas Browne">Thomas Browne</a>. Like Browne and Pepys, Evelyn was a lifelong <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bibliophile" title="Bibliophile">bibliophile</a>, and by his death his library is known to have comprised 3,859 books and 822 pamphlets. Many were uniformly bound in a French taste and bear his motto <i>Omnia explorate; meliora retinete</i> ("explore everything; keep the better") from I Thessalonians 5, 21.</p>
<p>His daughter, Maria Evelyn (1665–1685), has been acknowledged as the pseudonymous author of the book <i>Mundus Muliebris</i> of 1690. <i>Mundus Muliebris: or, The Ladies Dressing Room Unlock'd and Her Toilette Spread. In Burlesque. Together with the Fop-Dictionary, Compiled for the Use of the Fair Sex</i> is a satirical guide in verse to Francophile fashion and terminology, and its authorship is often jointly credited to John Evelyn, who seems to have edited the work for press after his daughter's death.</p>
<p>In 1694 Evelyn moved back to <a href="/wiki/Wotton,_Surrey" title="Wotton, Surrey">Wotton, Surrey</a> as his elder brother, George, had no living sons available to inherit the estate. Evelyn inherited the estate and the family seat <a href="/wiki/Wotton_House,_Surrey" title="Wotton House, Surrey">Wotton House</a> on the death of his brother in 1699. Sayes Court was made available for rent. Its most notable tenant was Russian <a href="/wiki/Tsar" title="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="/wiki/Peter_the_Great" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a>, who lived there for three months in 1698 (and did great damage to both house and grounds). The house no longer exists, but a public park of the same name can be found off Evelyn Street.</p>
<p>Evelyn died in 1706 at his house in <a href="/wiki/Dover_Street" title="Dover Street">Dover Street</a>, London. Wotton House and estate were inherited by his grandson <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_John_Evelyn,_1st_Baronet_of_Wotton" title="Sir John Evelyn, 1st Baronet of Wotton">John</a> (1682–1763) later Sir John Evelyn, Bt.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Family">Family</span></h2>

<p>John and Mary Evelyn had eight children: Richard (1652–1658), John Standsfield (1653–1654), <a href="/wiki/John_Evelyn_the_Younger" title="John Evelyn the Younger">John (the younger)</a> (1655–1699), George (1657–1658), Richard II (1664), Maria (1665–1685), Elizabeth (1667–1685) and Susanna (1669–1754). Only Susanna outlived her parents. Mary Evelyn died in 1709, three years after her husband. Both are buried in the Evelyn Chapel in St John's Church, Wotton.</p>
<p>Evelyn's epitaph (original spelling) reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here lies the Body of JOHN EVELYN Esq of this place, second son of RICHARD EVELYN Esq who having served the Publick in several employments of which that Commissioner of the Privy Seal in the reign of King James the 2nd was most Honourable: and perpetuated his fame by far more lasting Monuments than those of Stone, or Brass: his Learned and useful works, fell asleep the 27th day of February 1705/6 being the 86th Year of his age in full hope of a glorious resurrection thro faith in Jesus Christ. Living in an age of extraordinary events, and revolutions he learnt (as himself asserted) this truth which pursuant to his intention is here declared. That all is vanity which is not honest and that there's no solid Wisdom but in real piety.<br/>
Of five Sons and three Daughters borne to him from his most vertuous and excellent Wife MARY sole daughter, and heiress of Sir RICHARD BROWNE of Sayes Court near Deptford in Kent onely one Daughter SUSANNA married to WILLIAM DRAPER Esq of Adscomb in this County survived him – the two others dying in the flower of their age, and all the sons very young except one nam'd John who deceased 24 March 1698/9 in the 45th year of his age, leaving one son JOHN and one daughter ELIZABETH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wotton House and estate passed down to Evelyn's great-great-grandson <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_Frederick_Evelyn,_3rd_Baronet" title="Sir Frederick Evelyn, 3rd Baronet">Sir Frederick Evelyn, 3rd Bt</a> (1733–1812). The baronetcy next passed to Frederick Evelyn's cousins, <a href="/wiki/Sir_John_Evelyn,_4th_Baronet" title="Sir John Evelyn, 4th Baronet">Sir John Evelyn, 4th Bt</a> (1757–1833) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_Hugh_Evelyn,_5th_Baronet" title="Sir Hugh Evelyn, 5th Baronet">Sir Hugh Evelyn, 5th Bt</a> (1769–1848). Both these two were of unsound mind and the estate was therefore left to a remote cousin descended from the diarist's grandfather's first marriage, in whose family it remains to this day though they no longer occupy the house. The title died out in 1848. However, there are many living descendants of John Evelyn the diarist via his daughter Susanna, Mrs William Draper, and his granddaughter Elizabeth, Mrs Simon Harcourt. There are many descendants of John Evelyn's (the diarist) great-great-grandson, Charles Evelyn Jnr via his daughter Susanna Prideaux (Evelyn) Wright living in New Zealand. Charles Evelyn Jnr was also the father of Sir John Evelyn, 4th Bt, and the last baronet, Sir Hugh Evelyn, 5th Bt.</p>
<p>In 1992 the skulls of John and Mary were stolen by persons unknown who hacked into the stone sarcophagi on the chapel floor and tore open the coffins. They have not been recovered.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/John_Evelyn%27s_Diary" title="John Evelyn's Diary">John Evelyn's Diary</a></div>
<p><i>Evelyn's Diary</i> remained unpublished as a manuscript until 1818. It is in a <a href="/wiki/Quarto" title="Quarto">quarto</a> volume containing 700 pages, covering the years between 1641 and 1697, and is continued in a smaller book – which brings the narrative down to within three weeks of its author's death. A selection from this was edited by <a href="/wiki/William_Bray_(antiquary)" title="William Bray (antiquary)">William Bray</a>, with the permission of the Evelyn family, in 1818, under the title of <i>Memoirs illustrative of the Life and Writings of John Evelyn, comprising his Diary from 1641 to 1705/6, and a Selection of his Familiar Letters</i>. Other editions followed, the most notable being those of H. B. Wheatley (1879) and <a href="/wiki/Austin_Dobson" title="Austin Dobson">Austin Dobson</a> (3 vols, 1906).</p>
<p>Evelyn's active mind produced many other works, and although these have been overshadowed by the famous <i>Diary</i> they are of considerable interest. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Of Liberty and Servitude</i> ... (1649), a translation from the French of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_la_Mothe_le_Vayer" title="François de la Mothe le Vayer">François de la Mothe le Vayer</a>, Evelyn's own copy of which contains a note that he was "like to be call'd in question by the Rebells for this booke";</li>
<li><i>The State of France, as it stood in the IXth year of ... Louis XIII</i> (1652), a pamphlet drawn up from personal observations about the royal family, the court, the officials, the military forces, the institutions and customs of France;</li>
<li><i>An Essay on the First Book of T. Lucretius Carus de Rerum Natura</i>. Interpreted and made English verse by J. Evelyn (1656); to his translation, Evelyn attached a commentary based on the writings of Gassendi and other philosophical atomists ;</li>
<li><i>The Golden Book of St <a href="/wiki/John_Chrysostom" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, concerning the Education of Children. Translated out of the Greek by J. E.</i> (printed 1658, dated 1659);</li>
<li><i>The French Gardener: Instructing How to Cultivate all sorts of Fruit-Trees, and Herbs for the Garden</i> (1658), translated from the French of Nicolas de Bonnefons;</li>
<li><i>A Character of England, As it was lately presented in a Letter to a Nobleman of France</i> (1659), a satire describing the customs of the country as they would appear to a foreign observer, reprinted in <a href="/wiki/John_Somers,_1st_Baron_Somers" title="John Somers, 1st Baron Somers">Somers'</a> <i>Tracts</i> (ed. Scott, 1812), and in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i> (ed. Park, 1813);</li>
<li><i>The Late Newes, or Message from Bruxels Unmasked, and his Majesty Vindicated</i> ... (1660), in answer to a libellous pamphlet on Charles I by <a href="/wiki/Marchamont_Nedham" title="Marchamont Nedham">Marchamont Nedham</a>;</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Fumifugium" title="Fumifugium">Fumifugium: or The Inconvenience of the Aer and Smoak of London Dissipated</a></i> (1661), in which he suggested that sweet-smelling trees should be planted in London to purify the air;</li>
<li><i>Instructions Concerning Erecting of a Library</i> ... (1661), from the French of <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Naud%C3%A9" title="Gabriel Naudé">Gabriel Naudé</a>;</li>
<li><i>Tyrannus or the Mode, in a Discourse of Sumptuary Laws</i> (1661);</li>
<li><i>Sculptura: or the History, and Art of Chalcography and Engraving in Copper...</i> (1662); this contains the first account of "A new manner of Engraving, or <i><a href="/wiki/Mezzotint" title="Mezzotint">Mezzo Tinto</a></i>, communicated by his Highnesse <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rupert_of_the_Rhine" title="Rupert of the Rhine">Prince Rupert</a> to the Author of this Treatise". In fact many think Rupert, who had played a part in the invention or perfecting of mezzotint, wrote or co-wrote this part. The <a href="/wiki/Book_frontispiece" title="Book frontispiece">frontispiece</a> "invented" (designed) by Evelyn demonstrates his limitations as an artist of the figure, unless he was badly let down by his engraver.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Sylva,_or_A_Discourse_of_Forest-Trees_and_the_Propagation_of_Timber" title="Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber">Sylva, or a Discourse of Forest Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesties Dominions <i>to which is annexed Pomona ... Also Kalendarium Hortense</i></a></i> ... (1664); the best known of his books; a plea for reafforestation aimed at landowners ;</li>
<li><i>A Parallel of the Antient Architecture with the Modern</i> (1664), from the French of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roland_Fr%C3%A9art" title="Roland Fréart">Roland Fréart</a>, to which was added <i>an Account of Architects and Architecture</i> from Evelyn's own pen ;</li>
<li><i>An Idea of the Perfection of Painting: Demonstrated From the Principles of Art, and by Examples</i> (1668), a translation of another work by Roland Fréart;</li>
<li><i>The History of the three late famous Imposters, viz. Padre Ottomano, Mahomed Bei, and <a href="/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi" title="Sabbatai Zevi">Sabatei Sevi</a></i> ... (1669);</li>
<li><i>Navigation and Commerce, in which his Majesties title to the Dominion of the Sea is asserted against the Novel and later Pretenders</i> (1674), which is a preface to a projected history of the Dutch wars undertaken at the request of <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>., but countermanded on the conclusion of peace;</li>
<li><i>A Philosophical Discourse of Earth</i> ... (1676), a treatise on horticulture, better known by its later title of <i>Terra; The Compleat Gardener</i> (1693), from the French of J. de la Quintinie;</li>
<li><i>Numismata. A Discourse of Medals, Antient and Modern... To which is added a Disgression concerning Physiognomy</i> (1697);</li>
<li><i>Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets...</i> (1699), the first recorded book on salads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these were reprinted in <i>The Miscellaneous Writings of John Evelyn</i>, edited (1825) by <a href="/wiki/William_Upcott" title="William Upcott">William Upcott</a>.</p>
<p>Evelyn's friendship with <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Godolphin" title="Margaret Godolphin">Margaret Blagge</a>, afterwards Mrs Godolphin, is recorded in the diary, when he says he designed "to consecrate her worthy life to posterity". This he effectually did in a little masterpiece of religious biography which remained in manuscript in the possession of the Harcourt family until it was edited by <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Wilberforce" title="Samuel Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a>, bishop of Oxford, as the <i>Life of Mrs Godolphin</i> (1847), reprinted in the "King's Classics" (1904). The picture of Mistress Blagge's saintly life at court is heightened in interest when read in connexion with the scandalous memoirs of the <a href="/wiki/Philibert_de_Gramont" title="Philibert de Gramont">comte de Gramont</a>, or contemporary political satires on the court.</p>
<p>Numerous other papers and letters of Evelyn on scientific subjects and matters of public interest are preserved, including a collection of private and official letters and papers (1642–1712) by, or addressed to, <a href="/wiki/Sir_Richard_Browne,_1st_Baronet,_of_Deptford" title="Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of Deptford">Sir Richard Browne</a> and his son-in-law, now held by the <a href="/wiki/British_Library" title="British Library">British Library</a> (Add. MSS. 15857 and 15858).</p>
<p>In the opinion of the author of his biography in the eleventh edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, next to the <i>Diary</i> Evelyn's most valuable work is <i>Sylva</i>. Evelyn believed that the country was being rapidly depleted of wood by industries such as glass factories and iron furnaces, while no attempt was being made to replace the damage by planting. Evelyn put in a plea for afforestation, and besides producing a valuable work on arboriculture, he was able to assert in his preface to the king that he had really induced landowners to plant many millions of trees.</p>

<p>In 1977 and 1978 in eight auctions at <a href="/wiki/Christie%27s" title="Christie's">Christie's</a>, a major surviving portion of Evelyn's library was sold and dispersed. The <a href="/wiki/British_Library" title="British Library">British Library</a> holds a large archive of Evelyn's personal papers including the manuscript of his Diary.
