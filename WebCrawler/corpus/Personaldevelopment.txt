Personal development takes place over the course of a person's entire life. Not limited to <a href="/wiki/Self-help" title="Self-help">self-help</a>, the concept involves formal and informal activities for developing others in roles such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, life coach or mentor. When personal development takes place in the context of <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a>, it refers to the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_development_(psychology)" title="Human development (psychology)">human development</a> at the individual level in <a href="/wiki/Organization" title="Organization">organizations</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Personal development can also include developing other people. This may take place through roles such as those of a <a href="/wiki/Teacher" title="Teacher">teacher</a> or mentor, either through a personal competency (such as the skill of certain <a href="/wiki/Management" title="Management">managers</a> in developing the potential of employees) or through a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching).</p>
<p>Beyond improving oneself and developing others, "personal development" labels a field of practice and research. As a field of practice, it includes personal development methods, learning programs, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/assessment" title="wikt:assessment">assessment</a> systems, tools, and techniques. As a field of research, personal development topics increasingly appear in scientific journals, higher education reviews, management journals and <a href="/wiki/Business_sector" title="Business sector">business</a> books.</p>
<p>Any sort of development—whether economic, political, biological, organizational or personal—requires a <a class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Framework_(disambiguation)" title="Framework (disambiguation)">framework</a> if one wishes to know whether a change has actually occurred. In the case of personal development, an individual often functions as the primary judge of improvement or of regression, but validation of objective improvement requires assessment using standard criteria. Personal-development frameworks may include goals or benchmarks that define the end-points, strategies or plans for reaching goals, measurement, and assessment of progress, levels or stages that define milestones along a development path, and a feedback system to provide information on changes.</p>

<p>Two individual ancient philosophers: Aristotle and the Western Tradition and Confucius and the Eastern Tradition stand out as major sources of what has become personal development in the 21st century, representing a Western tradition and an East Asian tradition. Elsewhere anonymous founders of schools of self-development appear endemic – note the traditions of the Indian sub-continent in this regard.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="South_Asian_traditions">South Asian traditions</span></h3>

<p>Some ancient Indians aspired to "beingness, wisdom and happiness".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aristotle_and_the_Western_tradition">Aristotle and the Western tradition</span></h3>
<p>The Greek philosopher <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384 BCE – 322 BCE) influenced theories of personal development in the West. In his <i><a href="/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a></i>, Aristotle defined personal development as a category of <a href="/wiki/Phronesis" title="Phronesis">phronesis</a> or practical wisdom, where the practice of virtues (<i>arête</i>) leads to <i><a href="/wiki/Eudaimonia" title="Eudaimonia">eudaimonia</a></i>, commonly translated as "happiness" but more accurately understood as "human flourishing" or "living well". Aristotle continues to influence the Western concept of personal development to this day, particularly in the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_human_development&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Economics of human development (page does not exist)">economics of human development</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Positive_psychology" title="Positive psychology">positive psychology</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Confucius_and_the_East_Asian_tradition">Confucius and the East Asian tradition</span></h3>
<p>In Chinese tradition, <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> (around 551 BCE – 479 BCE) founded an ongoing philosophy. His ideas continue to influence <a href="/wiki/Family_values" title="Family values">family values</a>, education and <a href="/wiki/Management" title="Management">management</a> in China and East Asia. In his <i><a href="/wiki/Great_Learning" title="Great Learning">Great Learning</a></i> Confucius wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychology">Psychology</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">Psychology</a> became linked to personal development starting with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Adler" title="Alfred Adler">Alfred Adler</a> (1870–1937) and <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> (1875–1961).</p>
<p>Adler refused to limit psychology to analysis, making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences. He also originated the concepts of <a href="/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)" title="Lifestyle (sociology)">lifestyle</a> (1929—he defined "lifestyle" as an individual's characteristic approach to life, in facing problems) and of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self_image" title="Self image">self image</a>, a concept that influenced management under the heading of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Work-life_balance" title="Work-life balance">work-life balance</a>.</p>
<p>Carl Gustav Jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of <a href="/wiki/Individuation" title="Individuation">individuation</a>, which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self_(psychology)" title="Self (psychology)">Self</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Daniel_Levinson" title="Daniel Levinson">Daniel Levinson</a> (1920–1994) developed Jung's early concept of "<a href="/wiki/Developmental_stage_theories" title="Developmental stage theories">life stages</a>" and included a sociological perspective. Levinson proposed that personal development come under the influence—throughout <a href="/wiki/Personal_life" title="Personal life">life</a>—of aspirations, which he called "the Dream":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the nature of his Dream, a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out. It makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the Dream, or opposed to it. If the Dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die, and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Levinson's model of seven life-stages has been considerably modified due to sociological changes in the <a href="/wiki/Biological_life_cycle" title="Biological life cycle">lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>Research on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by <a href="/wiki/Albert_Bandura" title="Albert Bandura">Albert Bandura</a> (born 1925), suggested that <a href="/wiki/Self-efficacy" title="Self-efficacy">self-efficacy</a> best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results. According to Bandura <a href="/wiki/Self-confidence" title="Self-confidence">self-confidence</a> functions as a powerful predictor of success because:</p>
<ol>
<li>it makes you expect to succeed</li>
<li>it allows you take risks and set challenging goals</li>
<li>it helps you keep trying if at first you don't succeed</li>
<li>it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1998 <a href="/wiki/Martin_Seligman" title="Martin Seligman">Martin Seligman</a> won election to a one-year term as President of the <a href="/wiki/American_Psychological_Association" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> and proposed a new focus: on healthy individuals rather than on pathology (he created the "<a href="/wiki/Positive_psychology" title="Positive psychology">positive psychology</a>" current)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have discovered that there is a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against mental illness: courage, optimism, interpersonal skill, work ethic, hope, honesty and perseverance. Much of the task of prevention will be to create a science of human strength whose mission will be to foster these virtues in young people.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Higher_education">Higher education</span></h3>
<p>Personal development has been at the heart of education in the West in the form of the Greek philosophers; and in the East with Confucius. Some people emphasize personal development as a part of higher education. <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt" title="Wilhelm von Humboldt">Wilhelm von Humboldt</a>, who founded the University of Berlin (since 1949: <a href="/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin" title="Humboldt University of Berlin">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>) in 1810, made a statement interpretable as referring to personal development: <i>… if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual, it is precisely education, whose object it is to develop the individual.</i></p>
<p>During the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on American campuses led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students. <a href="/wiki/Arthur_W._Chickering" title="Arthur W. Chickering">Arthur Chickering</a> defined <a href="/wiki/Chickering%27s_theory_of_identity_development" title="Chickering's theory of identity development">seven vectors of personal development</a> for young adults during their undergraduate years:</p>
<ol>
<li>developing <a href="/wiki/Skill" title="Skill">competence</a></li>
<li>managing <a href="/wiki/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotions</a></li>
<li>achieving <a href="/wiki/Autonomy" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interdependence" title="Interdependence">interdependence</a></li>
<li>developing mature <a href="/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship" title="Interpersonal relationship">interpersonal relationships</a></li>
<li>establishing <a href="/wiki/Personal_identity" title="Personal identity">identity</a></li>
<li>developing purpose</li>
<li>developing <a href="/wiki/Integrity" title="Integrity">integrity</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In the UK, personal development took a central place in university policy in 1997 when the <a href="/wiki/Dearing_Report" title="Dearing Report">Dearing Report</a> declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal development. In 2001 a Quality Assessment Agency for UK universities produced guidelines for universities to enhance personal development as:</p>
<p><i>* a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning, performance and / or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development;</i><br/>
<i>* objectives related explicitly to student development; to improve the capacity of students to understand what and how they are learning, and to review, plan and take responsibility for their own learning</i></p>
<p>In the 1990s, <a href="/wiki/Business_school" title="Business school">business schools</a> began to set up specific personal-development programs for <a href="/wiki/Leadership" title="Leadership">leadership</a> and <a href="/wiki/Career" title="Career">career</a> orientation and in 1998 the <a href="/wiki/European_Foundation_for_Management_Development" title="European Foundation for Management Development">European Foundation for Management Development</a> set up the <a href="/wiki/European_Quality_Improvement_System" title="European Quality Improvement System">EQUIS</a> accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships, working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs.</p>
<p>The first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between Metizo, a personal-development consulting firm, and the Euromed Management School in Marseilles: students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate self-awareness and achievement of personal-development competencies.</p>
<p>As an academic department personal development has become a specific discipline, usually associated with <a href="/wiki/Business_school" title="Business school">business schools</a>. As an area of research, personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a> for questions of learning and assessment</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> for motivation and personality</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> for identity and social networks</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a> for human capital and economic value</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> for ethics and self-reflection</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_workplace">The workplace</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Abraham_Maslow" title="Abraham Maslow">Abraham Maslow</a> (1908–1970), proposed a <a href="/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" title="Maslow's hierarchy of needs">hierarchy of needs</a> with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self_actualization" title="Self actualization">self actualization</a> at the top, defined as:</p>
<p><i>… the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.</i></p>
<p>Since Maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people <a href="/wiki/Self-actualization" title="Self-actualization">self-actualize</a>—he estimated one percent—his hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid, while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees.</p>
<p>As organizations and labor markets became more global, <a href="/wiki/Moral_responsibility" title="Moral responsibility">responsibility</a> for development shifted from the company to the individual. In 1999 management thinker <a href="/wiki/Peter_Drucker" title="Peter Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> wrote in the <i><a href="/wiki/Harvard_Business_Review" title="Harvard Business Review">Harvard Business Review</a></i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: if you've got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren't managing their employees' careers; <a href="/wiki/Knowledge_worker" title="Knowledge worker">knowledge workers</a> must, effectively, be their own chief executive officers. It's up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years.<i></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Management professors <a href="/wiki/Sumantra_Ghoshal" title="Sumantra Ghoshal">Sumantra Ghoshal</a> of the London Business School and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christopher_Bartlett" title="Christopher Bartlett">Christopher Bartlett</a> of the Harvard Business School wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract. On the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value: "market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative, creativity and skills of all employees".</p>
<p>On the other hand, employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and "... embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development".</p>
<p>The 1997 publication of Ghoshal's and Bartlett's <i>Individualized Corporation</i> corresponded to a change in <a href="/wiki/Career_development" title="Career development">career development</a> from a system of predefined paths defined by companies, to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities. Another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that women's careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men. The 2007 study of women's careers by Sylvia Ann Hewlett <i>Off-Ramps and On-Ramps</i> had a major impact on the way companies view careers. Further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by Herminia Ibarra in her <i>Working Identity</i> on the relationship with career change and identity change, indicating that priorities of <a href="/wiki/Employment" title="Employment">work</a> and lifestyle continually develop through life.</p>
<p>Personal development programs in companies fall into two categories: the provision of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Employee_benefit" title="Employee benefit">employee benefits</a> and the fostering of development strategies.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Employee_benefit" title="Employee benefit">Employee benefits</a> have the purpose of improving satisfaction, motivation and loyalty. Employee surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs, preferences and problems, and they use the results to design benefits programs. Typical programs in this category include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Work-life_balance" title="Work-life balance">work-life balance</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Time_management" title="Time management">time management</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Stress_management" title="Stress management">stress management</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Health" title="Health">health</a> programs</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Counseling" title="Counseling">counseling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work: yoga, sports, martial arts, money-management, positive psychology, <a href="/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">NLP</a>, etc.</p>
<p>As an investment, personal development programs have the goal of increasing <a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a> or improving <a href="/wiki/Productivity" title="Productivity">productivity</a>, innovation or quality. Proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organization's strategic development goals. Employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee, usually defined in a <a href="/wiki/Talent_management" title="Talent management">talent management</a> architecture including populations such as new hires, perceived high-potential employees, perceived key employees, sales staff, research staff and perceived future <a href="/wiki/Leadership" title="Leadership">leaders</a>. Organizations may also offer other (non-investment-oriented) programs to many or even all employees. Typical programs focus on career-development, <a href="/wiki/Personal_effectiveness" title="Personal effectiveness">personal effectiveness</a>, teamwork, and competency-development.

<p>Scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Steve_Salerno&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Steve Salerno (page does not exist)">Steve Salerno</a> portrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym <i>SHAM:</i> <i>The Self-Help and <a href="/wiki/Self-actualization" title="Self-actualization">Actualization</a> Movement</i>—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals, but also as <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Socially_harmful&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Socially harmful (page does not exist)">socially harmful</a>. 'Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or not'. Others similarly point out that with self-help books 'supply increases the demand...The more people read them, the more they think they need them...more like an <a href="/wiki/Addiction" title="Addiction">addiction</a> than an alliance'. Self-help writers have been described as working 'in the area of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ideological" title="Ideological">ideological</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Imagination" title="Imagination">imagined</a>, the narrativized....although a veneer of <a href="/wiki/Scientism" title="Scientism">scientism</a> permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moralizing" title="Moralizing">moralizing</a>'.</p>
