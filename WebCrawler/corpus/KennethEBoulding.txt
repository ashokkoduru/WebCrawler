<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Boulding was born in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liverpool,_England" title="Liverpool, England">Liverpool, England</a> in 1910. He graduated from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>, and was granted <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> citizenship in 1948. From 1934 to 1937, he was an academic staff at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> and from 1937 to 1941, he taught at <a href="/wiki/Colgate_University" title="Colgate University">Colgate University</a>. From 1945 to 1949 he was a faculty member of Iowa State College, now <a href="/wiki/Iowa_State_University" title="Iowa State University">Iowa State University</a>; and during the years 1949 to 1967, he was a faculty member of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>. In 1967, he joined the faculty of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder" title="University of Colorado at Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>, where he remained until his retirement.</p>
<p>Boulding was president of numerous scholarly societies including the <a href="/wiki/American_Economic_Association" title="American Economic Association">American Economic Association</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Society_for_General_Systems_Research" title="Society for General Systems Research">Society for General Systems Research</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>. He was not only a prolific writer and a creative integrator of knowledge, but an academician of world stature—indeed, a magisterial figure in the discipline of social science. For Boulding, economics and <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> were not social sciences—rather they were all aspects of a single social science devoted to the study of human persons and their relationships (organizations). Boulding spearheaded an evolutionary (instead of equilibrium) approach to economics.</p>
<p>Boulding, with his wife <a href="/wiki/Elise_M._Boulding" title="Elise M. Boulding">Elise</a>, was an active member of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="Religious Society of Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a>, or Quakers. He took part in Quaker gatherings, served on committees, and spoke to and about the Friends. The two were members of meetings in Nashville, Tennessee, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Boulder, Colorado. Interestingly, although he stuttered, when he ministered in a Friends meeting, he spoke clearly.</p>
<p>Kenneth Boulding was instrumental in organizing the <a class="external text" href="https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_2/3_2_4.pdf" rel="nofollow">first Teach-In</a> relating to the Vietnam War at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in March, 1965. He later spoke on the steps of the Hatcher Graduate Library at the University and was pelted with snowballs by a group of disagreeing students.</p>
<p>In March 1977, he even conducted a silent vigil at the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/American_Friends_Service_Committee" title="American Friends Service Committee">American Friends Service Committee</a> in Philadelphia to protest what he considered its distancing itself from Quakers. He penned the widely circulated "There is a Spirit," a series of sonnets he wrote in 1945 based on the last statement of the 17th century Quaker <a href="/wiki/James_Nayler" title="James Nayler">James Nayler</a>.</p>
<p>Boulding emphasized that human economic and other behavior is embedded in a larger interconnected system. To understand the results of our behavior, economic or otherwise, we must first research and develop a scientific understanding of the <a href="/wiki/Ecodynamics" title="Ecodynamics">ecodynamics</a> of the general system, the global society in which we live, in all its dimensions spiritual and material. Boulding believed that in the absence of a committed effort to the right kind of social science research and understanding, the human species might well be doomed to extinction. But he died optimistic, believing our evolutionary journey had just begun.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work">Work</span></h2>
<p>In addition to <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, Boulding made important contributions to the fields of <a href="/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">social psychology</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_Analysis"><i>Economic Analysis</i></span></h3>
<p>Boulding's major work in economics was his introductory textbook, <i>Economic Analysis</i>, which first appeared in 1941. The book sought "to be a contribution to the development and systematization of the body of economic analysis itself."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychic_capital">Psychic capital</span></h3>
<p><i>Psychic capital</i> is a term first used by Boulding (1950). <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">Capital</a> is an accumulation of wealth, and with psychic capital, the accumulation is one of desirable mental states, which admittedly are highly transitory in nature. The mental states could be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Memories" title="Memories">memories</a> of pleasure, success, achievement, recognition, and the desire to add to psychic capital is likely to be a powerful motivating force. Exchanges involving increases or decreases of psychic capital are likely to occur at any time, either through decision or through the turn of events.</p>
<p>However, <a href="/wiki/Failure" title="Failure">failure</a> in a task could also lead to a depletion of psychic capital. An accumulation of negative memories of failures, <a href="/wiki/Disaster" title="Disaster">disasters</a>, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atrocity" title="wiktionary:atrocity">atrocities</a>, or perceived injustices and indignities (as either recipient or perpetrator) could be called negative psychic capital. Negative psychic capital can also be a powerful motivating factor, in the pursuit of satisfaction through <a href="/wiki/Revenge" title="Revenge">revenge</a> or a settling of scores. In either of its forms as positive or negative psychic capital, this package of <a href="/wiki/Collective_memory" title="Collective memory">collective memory</a> is an essential link between collective memory and <a href="/wiki/Collective_mental_state" title="Collective mental state">collective mental state</a>.</p>
<p>The concept is somewhat more specific than <a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a>, which focuses on <a href="/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">social networks</a> rather than mental states.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Evolutionary_economics">Evolutionary economics</span></h3>
<p>Boulding was the key exponent of the <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_economics" title="Evolutionary economics">evolutionary economics</a> movement. In his “Economic Development as an Evolutionary System” (1961, 1964), Boulding suggests a parallel between economic development and biological evolution.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>They, economics and evolution, are both examples of a larger process, which has been at work in this part of the universe for a very long time. This is the process of the development of structures of increasing complexity and improbability. The evolutionary process always operates through mutation and selection and has involved some distinction between the genotype which mutates and the phenotype which is selected. The process by which the genotype constructs the phenotype may be described as "organization". Economic development manifests itself largely in the production of commodities, that is, goods and services. It originates, however, in ideas, plans, and attitudes in the human mind. These are the genotypes in economic development. This whole process indeed can be described as a process in the growth of knowledge. What the economist calls "capital" is nothing more than human knowledge imposed on the material world. Knowledge and the growth of knowledge, therefore, is the essential key to economic development. Investment, financial systems and economic organizations and institutions are in a sense only the machinery by which a knowledge process is created and expressed.</p>

<p>Kenneth Boulding was also nominated for the Nobel Prize for both peace and economics.</p>
