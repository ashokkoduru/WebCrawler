<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>It was founded in 1961 as Sevcon Engineering Ltd. The company was formed to develop technology originated by Horace William Heyman (13 March 1912 - 4 September 1998), who had been Managing Director of <a href="/wiki/Smith_Electric_Vehicles" title="Smith Electric Vehicles">Smith Electric Vehicles</a> from 1949 until 1964. It was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in Europe.</p>
<p>His technology improved battery-life for frequent start-stop runs of electric vehicles at low speeds. There were always large electrical losses on starting an electric vehicle because of <a href="/wiki/Joule_heating" title="Joule heating">electrical resistances heating up</a>. The technology allowed a 20% reduction in battery size for equivalent power, or increased battery length or power for a standard-sized battery.</p>
<p>An electric vehicle would have had resistances to <a href="/wiki/Voltage_drop" title="Voltage drop">drop the voltage</a> on the motor when starting, but this created heating. His technology employed <a href="/wiki/PWM_rectifier" title="PWM rectifier">semiconductor-controlled rectifiers</a>, with a semiconductor oscillator, which provided pulses of electrical power to power the motor.</p>
<p>It won the Queen's Award to Industry in April 1970, and the <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Awards_for_Enterprise" title="Queen's Awards for Enterprise">Queen's Awards for Export</a> in April 1975. A new factory opened in June 1970 at Gateshead.</p>
