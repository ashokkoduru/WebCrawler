<p>A <b>lake</b> is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a <a href="/wiki/Depression_(geology)" title="Depression (geology)">basin</a>, that is surrounded by land, apart from any <a href="/wiki/River_mouth" title="River mouth">river</a> or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the <a href="/wiki/World_Ocean" title="World Ocean">ocean</a>, and therefore are distinct from <a href="/wiki/Lagoon" title="Lagoon">lagoons</a>, and are also larger and deeper than <a href="/wiki/Pond" title="Pond">ponds</a>, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">rivers</a> or <a href="/wiki/Stream" title="Stream">streams</a>, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, <a href="/wiki/Rift_zone" title="Rift zone">rift zones</a>, and areas with ongoing <a href="/wiki/Glacier" title="Glacier">glaciation</a>. Other lakes are found in <a href="/wiki/Endorheic_basin" title="Endorheic basin">endorheic basins</a> or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ice_Age" title="Ice Age">Ice Age</a>. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.</p>
<p>Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydro-electric_power" title="Hydro-electric power">hydro-electric power</a> generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic or recreational purposes or even for other activities .</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology.2C_meaning.2C_and_usage_of_.22lake.22">Etymology, meaning, and usage of "lake"</span></h2>



<p>The word <i>lake</i> comes from <a href="/wiki/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a> <i>lake</i> ("lake, pond, waterway"), from <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> <i>lacu</i> ("pond, pool, stream"), from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proto-Germanic" title="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> *<i>lakō</i> ("pond, ditch, slow moving stream"), from the <a href="/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European</a> root *<i>leǵ-</i> ("to leak, drain"). Cognates include <a href="/wiki/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> <i>laak</i> ("lake, pond, ditch"), <a href="/wiki/Middle_Low_German" title="Middle Low German">Middle Low German</a> <i>lāke</i> ("water pooled in a riverbed, puddle"), <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> <i>Lache</i> ("pool, puddle"), and <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_language" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic</a> <i>lækur</i> ("slow flowing stream"). Also related are the English words <i>leak</i> and <i>leach</i>.</p>
<p>There is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and <a href="/wiki/Pond" title="Pond">ponds</a>, and no current internationally accepted definition of either term across scientific disciplines or political boundaries exists. For example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Limnologist" title="Limnologist">limnologists</a> have defined lakes as water bodies which are simply a larger version of a pond, which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind-induced turbulence plays a major role in mixing the water column. None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are difficult to measure. For this reason, simple size-based definitions are increasingly used to separate ponds and lakes. One definition of <i>lake</i> is a body of water of 2 hectares (5 acres) or more in area; however, others have defined lakes as waterbodies of 5 hectares (12 acres) and above, or 8 hectares (20 acres) and above  (see also the <a href="/wiki/Pond#Technical_definitions" title="Pond">definition of "pond"</a>). <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sutherland_Elton" title="Charles Sutherland Elton">Charles Elton</a>, one of the founders of <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, regarded lakes as waterbodies of 40 hectares (99 acres) or more. The term <i>lake</i> is also used to describe a feature such as <a href="/wiki/Lake_Eyre" title="Lake Eyre">Lake Eyre</a>, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall. In common usage, many lakes bear names ending with the word <i>pond</i>, and a lesser number of names ending with <i>lake</i> are in quasi-technical fact, ponds. One textbook illustrates this point with the following: "In Newfoundland, for example, almost every lake is called a pond, whereas in Wisconsin, almost every pond is called a lake."</p>
<p>One <a href="/wiki/Hydrology" title="Hydrology">hydrology</a> book proposes to define the term "lake" as a body of water with the following five characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>it partially or totally fills one or several basins connected by straits</li>
<li>has essentially the same water level in all parts (except for relatively short-lived variations caused by wind, varying ice cover, large inflows, etc.)</li>
<li>it does not have regular intrusion of <a href="/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">seawater</a></li>
<li>a considerable portion of the sediment suspended in the water is captured by the basins (for this to happen they need to have a sufficiently small inflow-to-volume ratio)</li>
<li>the area measured at the mean water level exceeds an arbitrarily chosen threshold (for instance, one <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectare</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the seawater intrusion criterion, the others have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology publications.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_of_lakes">Distribution of lakes</span></h2>


<p>The majority of lakes on Earth are <a href="/wiki/Fresh_water" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a>, and most lie in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> at higher <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitudes</a>. <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, with a <a href="/wiki/Drainage_system_(geomorphology)#Deranged_drainage_pattern" title="Drainage system (geomorphology)">deranged drainage system</a> has an estimated 31,752 lakes larger than 3 square kilometres (1.2 sq mi) and an unknown total number of lakes, but is estimated to be at least 2 million. <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> has 187,888 lakes 500 square metres (5,400 sq ft) or larger, of which 56,000 are large (10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft) or larger).</p>
<p>Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">river</a> or <a href="/wiki/Stream" title="Stream">stream</a>, which maintain a lake's average level by allowing the drainage of excess water. Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Endorheic" title="Endorheic">endorheic</a> lakes.</p>
<p>Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydro-electric" title="Hydro-electric">hydro-electric</a> power generation, aesthetic purposes, <a href="/wiki/Recreation" title="Recreation">recreational</a> purposes, <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industrial</a> use, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agricultural" title="Agricultural">agricultural</a> use or domestic water supply.</p>
<p>Evidence of extraterrestrial lakes exists; "definitive evidence of lakes filled with <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>" was announced by NASA as returned by the <a href="/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens" title="Cassini–Huygens">Cassini Probe</a> observing the moon <a href="/wiki/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a>, which orbits the planet <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>.</p>
<p>Globally, lakes are greatly outnumbered by ponds: of an estimated 304 million standing water bodies worldwide, 91% are 1 hectare (2.5 acres) or less in area (see definition of <a href="/wiki/Pond#Technical_definitions" title="Pond">ponds</a>). Small lakes are also much more numerous than large lakes: in terms of area, one-third of the world's standing water is represented by lakes and ponds of 10 hectares (25 acres) or less. However, large lakes account for much of the area of standing water with 122 large lakes of 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi, 100,000 <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">ha</a>, 247,000 <a href="/wiki/Acre" title="Acre">acres</a>) or more representing about 29% of the total global area of standing inland water.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_of_natural_lakes">Origin of natural lakes</span></h2>



<p>Since they progressively become filled by sediment, lakes are considered ephemeral over geological time scales, and long-living lakes imply that active processes keep forming the basins in which they form. There are a number of natural processes that can form lakes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tectonic_lakes">Tectonic lakes</span></h3>
<p>The longest-living lakes on Earth are related to tectonic processes which is created due to a <a href="/wiki/Tectonics" title="Tectonics">tectonic</a> uplift of a mountain range which create depressions that accumulate water and form lakes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Landslide_and_ice-dam_lakes">Landslide and ice-dam lakes</span></h3>
<p>Lakes can also form by means of landslides or by glacial blockages. An example of the latter occurred during the last ice age in the U.S. state of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)">Washington</a>, when a huge lake formed behind a glacial flow; when the ice retreated, the result was an immense flood that created the <a href="/wiki/Dry_Falls" title="Dry Falls">Dry Falls</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sun_Lakes_State_Park" title="Sun Lakes State Park">Sun Lakes</a>, Washington.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Salt_lakes">Salt lakes</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salt_lake_(geography)" title="Salt lake (geography)">Salt lakes</a> (also called <a href="/wiki/Saline_water" title="Saline water">saline</a> lakes) can form where there is no natural outlet or where the water evaporates rapidly and the drainage surface of the <a href="/wiki/Water_table" title="Water table">water table</a> has a higher-than-normal <a href="/wiki/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a> content. Examples of salt lakes include <a href="/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake" title="Great Salt Lake">Great Salt Lake</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Aral_Sea" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Sea" title="Dead Sea">Dead Sea</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oxbow_lakes">Oxbow lakes</span></h3>
<p>Small, crescent-shaped lakes called <a href="/wiki/Oxbow_lake" title="Oxbow lake">oxbow lakes</a> can form in river valleys as a result of meandering. The slow-moving river forms a sinuous shape as the outer side of bends are eroded away more rapidly than the inner side. Eventually a horseshoe bend is formed and the river cuts through the narrow neck. This new passage then forms the main passage for the river and the ends of the bend become silted up, thus forming a bow-shaped lake.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crater_lakes">Crater lakes</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Crater_lake" title="Crater lake">Crater lakes</a> are formed in <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_crater" title="Volcanic crater">volcanic craters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caldera" title="Caldera">calderas</a> which fill up with precipitation more rapidly than they empty via evaporation. Sometimes the latter are called caldera lakes, although often no distinction is made. An example is <a href="/wiki/Crater_Lake" title="Crater Lake">Crater Lake</a> in <a href="/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, in the caldera of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Mazama" title="Mount Mazama">Mount Mazama</a>. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption that led to the <a href="/wiki/Subsidence" title="Subsidence">subsidence</a> of Mount Mazama around 4860 BC.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Glacial_lakes">Glacial lakes</span></h3>
<p>The advance and retreat of glaciers can scrape depressions in the surface where water accumulates; such lakes are common in <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patagonia" title="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> and Canada. The most notable examples are probably the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> of North America. As a particular case, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gloe_lakes" title="Gloe lakes">gloe lakes</a> are basins that have emerged from the sea as a consequence of post-glacial rebound, and are now filled with freshwater.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_lakes">Other lakes</span></h3>
<p>Some lakes, such as <a href="/wiki/Lake_Jackson_(Tallahassee,_Florida)" title="Lake Jackson (Tallahassee, Florida)">Lake Jackson</a> in <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, USA, come into existence as a result of <a href="/wiki/Sinkhole" title="Sinkhole">sinkhole</a> activity.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lake_Vostok" title="Lake Vostok">Lake Vostok</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Subglacial_lake" title="Subglacial lake">subglacial lake</a> in <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, possibly the largest in the world. The pressure from the ice atop it and its internal chemical composition mean that, if the lake were drilled into, a fissure could result that would spray somewhat like a <a href="/wiki/Geyser" title="Geyser">geyser</a>.</p>
<p>Most lakes are geologically young and shrinking since the natural results of <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a> will tend to wear away the sides and fill the basin. Exceptions are those such as Lake Baikal and <a href="/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika" title="Lake Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a> that lie along continental <a href="/wiki/Rift_valley" title="Rift valley">rift zones</a> and are created by the crust's <a href="/wiki/Subsidence" title="Subsidence">subsidence</a> as two plates are pulled apart. These lakes are the oldest and deepest in the world. <a href="/wiki/Lake_Baikal" title="Lake Baikal">Lake Baikal</a>, which is 25-30 million years old, is deepening at a faster rate than it is being filled by erosion and may be destined over millions of years to become attached to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_ocean" title="Global ocean">global ocean</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>, for example, is thought to have originated as a rift-valley lake.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>




<p>Lakes have numerous features in addition to lake type, such as <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">drainage basin</a> (also known as catchment area), inflow and outflow, <a href="/wiki/Nutrient" title="Nutrient">nutrient</a> content, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dissolved_oxygen" title="Dissolved oxygen">dissolved oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_pollution" title="Water pollution">pollutants</a>, <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sediment" title="Sediment">sedimentation</a>.</p>
<p>Changes in the level of a lake are controlled by the difference between the input and output compared to the total volume of the lake. Significant input sources are precipitation onto the lake, runoff carried by streams and channels from the lake's <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">catchment</a> area, <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> channels and aquifers, and artificial sources from outside the catchment area. Output sources are evaporation from the lake, surface and groundwater flows, and any extraction of lake water by humans. As climate conditions and human water requirements vary, these will create fluctuations in the lake level.</p>
<p>Lakes can be also <a href="/wiki/Trophic_state_index" title="Trophic state index">categorized</a> on the basis of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be <i><a href="/wiki/Oligotroph" title="Oligotroph">oligotrophic</a></i> and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesotrophic_lake" title="Mesotrophic lake">Mesotrophic lakes</a></i> have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eutrophic" title="Eutrophic">Eutrophic</a></i> lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Algal_blooms" title="Algal blooms">algal blooms</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Eutrophication" title="Eutrophication">Hypertrophic</a></i> lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.</p>
<p>Due to the unusual relationship between water's <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a>, lakes form layers called <a href="/wiki/Thermocline" title="Thermocline">thermoclines</a>, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 °F) at sea level. When the temperature of the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climates, the water in the lake can mix, bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir of cold water year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deep_lake_water_cooling" title="Deep lake water cooling">deep lake water cooling</a>.</p>

<p>Since the surface water of deep <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical">tropical</a> lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if there is even a trace of <a href="/wiki/Volcano" title="Volcano">volcanic activity</a>. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water at the bottom of the lake. This is called a <a href="/wiki/Limnic_eruption" title="Limnic eruption">limnic eruption</a>. An example is <a href="/wiki/Lake_Nyos#The_1986_disaster" title="Lake Nyos">the disaster at Lake Nyos</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cameroon" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it, so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asphyxiation" title="Asphyxiation">asphyxiation</a>.</p>
<p>The material at the bottom of a lake, or <i>lake bed</i>, may be composed of a wide variety of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inorganic" title="Inorganic">inorganics</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Silt" title="Silt">silt</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sand" title="Sand">sand</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_material" title="Organic material">organic material</a>, such as decaying plant or animal matter. The composition of the lake bed has a significant impact on the flora and fauna found within the lake's environs by contributing to the amounts and the types of nutrients available.</p>
<p>A paired (black and white) layer of the varved lake sediments correspond to a year. During winter, when organisms die, carbon is deposited down, resulting to a black layer. At the same year, during summer, only few organic materials are deposited, resulting to a white layer at the lake bed. These are commonly used to track past paleontological events.</p>
<p>Natural lakes provide a <a href="/wiki/Macrocosm_and_microcosm" title="Macrocosm and microcosm">microcosm</a> of living and nonliving elements that are relatively independent of their surrounding environments. Therefore, lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lake’s surroundings.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Limnology" title="Limnology">Limnology</a> is the study of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the <i><a href="/wiki/Littoral_zone" title="Littoral zone">littoral zone</a></i>, a sloped area close to land; the <i><a href="/wiki/Photic_zone" title="Photic zone">photic</a></i> or <i>open-water zone</i>, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water <i><a href="/wiki/Profundal_zone" title="Profundal zone">profundal</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Benthic_zone" title="Benthic zone">benthic zone</a></i>, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on <a href="/wiki/Turbidity" title="Turbidity">turbidity</a>, determined by the density and size of suspended <a href="/wiki/Particle_(ecology)" title="Particle (ecology)">particles</a>. A particle is in <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)" title="Suspension (chemistry)">suspension</a> if its weight is less than the random turbidity <a href="/wiki/Force" title="Force">forces</a> acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or <a href="/wiki/Biotic_material" title="Biotic material">biological</a> in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alga" title="Alga">algae</a> and <a href="/wiki/Detritus" title="Detritus">detritus</a>. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Piscivorous" title="Piscivorous">Piscivorous</a> fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (<a href="/wiki/Plankton" title="Plankton">planktonivorous</a>) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic <a href="/wiki/Trophic_cascade" title="Trophic cascade">trophic cascade</a>). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a <i><a href="/wiki/Secchi_disk" title="Secchi disk">Secchi disk</a></i>, a 20-cm (8 in) disk with alternating white and black <a href="/wiki/Circular_sector" title="Circular sector">quadrants</a>. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the <i>Secchi depth</i>, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lentic_ecosystems" title="Lentic ecosystems">lentic ecosystems</a>.</p>
<p>A lake moderates the surrounding region's temperature and <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> because water has a very high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity" title="Specific heat capacity">specific heat capacity</a> (4,186 J·kg·K). In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a <a href="/wiki/Sea_breeze" title="Sea breeze">sea breeze</a>; in the night it can warm it with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Land_breeze" title="Land breeze">land breeze</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_lakes_disappear">How lakes disappear</span></h2>



<p>The lake may be infilled with deposited sediment and gradually become a <a href="/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetland</a> such as a <a href="/wiki/Swamp" title="Swamp">swamp</a> or <a href="/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marsh</a>. Large water plants, typically <a href="/wiki/Phragmites" title="Phragmites">reeds</a>, accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows. Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake. This is significant since wildfire has been largely suppressed in the developed world over the past century. This has artificially converted many shallow lakes into emergent marshes. Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant-eating fish tend to disappear more slowly. A "disappearing" lake (barely noticeable on a human timescale) typically has extensive plant mats at the water's edge. These become a new habitat for other plants, like <a href="/wiki/Sphagnum" title="Sphagnum">peat moss</a> when conditions are right, and animals, many of which are very rare. Gradually the lake closes and young <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> may form, forming a <a href="/wiki/Fen" title="Fen">fen</a>. In lowland river valleys where a river can <a href="/wiki/Meander" title="Meander">meander</a>, the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical <a href="/wiki/Oxbow_lake" title="Oxbow lake">oxbow lakes</a>. In the very last stages of <a href="/wiki/Ecological_succession" title="Ecological succession">succession</a>, trees can grow in, eventually turning the wetland into a forest.</p>
<p>Some lakes can disappear seasonally. These are called <b>intermittent lakes</b>, <b>ephemeral lakes</b>, or <b>seasonal lakes</b> and can be found in <a href="/wiki/Karst" title="Karst">karstic terrain</a>. A prime example of an intermittent lake is <a href="/wiki/Lake_Cerknica" title="Lake Cerknica">Lake Cerknica</a> in <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lag_Prau_Pulte" title="Lag Prau Pulte">Lag Prau Pulte</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Graub%C3%BCnden" title="Graubünden">Graubünden</a>. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or <a href="/wiki/Endorheic_basin" title="Endorheic basin">endorheic basin</a>, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like <a href="/wiki/Death_Valley" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a>. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains. The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is <a href="/wiki/Sevier_Lake" title="Sevier Lake">Sevier Lake</a> of west-central <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes a lake will disappear quickly. On 3 June 2005, in <a href="/wiki/Nizhny_Novgorod_Oblast" title="Nizhny Novgorod Oblast">Nizhny Novgorod Oblast</a>, Russia, a lake called <a href="/wiki/Lake_Beloye_(Nizhny_Novgorod_Oblast)" title="Lake Beloye (Nizhny Novgorod Oblast)">Lake Beloye</a> vanished in a matter of minutes. News sources reported that government officials theorized that this strange phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the <a href="/wiki/Oka_River" title="Oka River">Oka River</a>.</p>
<p>The presence of ground permafrost is important to the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal <i>Science</i> ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.</p>
<p>Some lakes disappear because of human development factors. The shrinking <a href="/wiki/Aral_Sea" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a> is described as being "murdered" by the diversion for irrigation of the rivers feeding it.</p>

<p>Only one world other than Earth is known to harbor large lakes, Saturn's largest moon, <a href="/wiki/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a>. Photographs and spectroscopic analysis by the <a href="/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens" title="Cassini–Huygens">Cassini–Huygens</a> <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a> show liquid <a href="/wiki/Ethane" title="Ethane">ethane</a> on the surface, which is thought to be mixed with liquid <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. The largest Titanean lake, <a href="/wiki/Kraken_Mare" title="Kraken Mare">Kraken Mare</a> at 400,000 km, is three-times the size of any lake on Earth, and even the second, <a href="/wiki/Ligeia_Mare" title="Ligeia Mare">Ligeia Mare</a>, is estimated to be slightly larger than Earth's Lake Michigan–Huron.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s large moon <a href="/wiki/Io_(moon)" title="Io (moon)">Io</a> is volcanically active, and as a result <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">Sulphur</a> deposits have accumulated on the surface. Some photographs taken during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galileo_spacecraft" title="Galileo spacecraft">Galileo mission</a> appear to show lakes of liquid sulfur in volcanic caldera, though these are more analogous to lake of lava than of water on Earth.</p>
<p>The planet <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> is too cold and has too little <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">atmospheric pressure</a> to permit the pooling of liquid water. Geologic evidence appears to confirm, however, that ancient lakes once formed on the surface. It is also possible that volcanic activity on Mars will occasionally melt subsurface ice, creating large temporary lakes. This water would quickly freeze and then sublimate, unless insulated in some manner, such as by a coating of volcanic ash.</p>
<p>There are dark basaltic plains on the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a>, similar to <a href="/wiki/Lunar_mare" title="Lunar mare">lunar maria</a> but smaller, that are called <i>lacus</i> (singular <i>lacus</i>, <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "lake") because they were thought by early astronomers to be lakes of water.</p>
