<p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Demographics" title="Demographics">demographics</a>, the <b>world population</b> is the total number of <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a> currently living. As of August 2016, it was estimated at 7.4 <a href="/wiki/1,000,000,000" title="1,000,000,000">billion</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> estimates it will further increase to 11.2 billion in the year 2100.</p>
<p>World population has experienced <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">continuous growth</a> since the end of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315%E2%80%9317" title="Great Famine of 1315–17">Great Famine of 1315–17</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> in 1350, when it was near 370 million. The highest <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_growth_rates" title="Population growth rates">population growth rates</a> – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred between 1955-1975 peaking to 2.06% between 1965-1970. The growth rate has declined to 1.18% between 2010-2015 and is projected to decline to 0.13% by the year 2100. Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million, and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 135 million, while deaths number 56 million per year and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Median_age" title="Median age">median age</a> of the world's population was estimated to be 30.1 years in 2016, with the male median age estimated to be 29.4 years and female, 30.9 years.</p>
<p>The 2012 UN projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate; the global population is expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. 2003 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Division" title="United Nations Population Division">UN Population Division</a> population projections for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion. One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate, while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 9.3 and 12.6 billion in 2100, and continued growth thereafter. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the <a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">growing pressures on the environment</a>, global food supplies, and energy resources.</p>

<p>Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BCE have ranged between 1 million and 15 million. Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BCE, according to the <a href="/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory#Genetic_bottleneck_theory" title="Toba catastrophe theory">Toba catastrophe theory</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a> of the 14th century may have reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400; it took 200 years for population figures to recover. The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393, presumably due to a combination of <a href="/wiki/Mongol_Empire" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol</a> invasions, famine, and plague.</p>

Between 1700 and 1900, Europe’s population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million. Altogether, the areas populated by people of European descent comprised 36% of the world's population in 1900.</p>
<p>Population growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Vaccination" title="Vaccination">vaccination</a> and other improvements in medicine and <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a>. Improved material conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century. The population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006. The United States saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920, exceeding 307 million in 2010.</p>
<p>The first half of the 20th century in <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Imperial Russia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> was marked by a succession of major wars, famines and other disasters which caused large-scale population losses (approximately 60 million excess deaths). After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's population declined significantly – from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012 – but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted.</p>
<p>Many countries in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_world" title="Developing world">developing world</a> have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century, due to economic development and improvements in public health.

<p>It is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, seven billion in March 2012. The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.</p>
<p>According to current projections, the global population will reach eight billion by 2024, and will likely reach around nine billion by 2037. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion. Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertility_rate" title="Fertility rate">fertility variable</a>. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the "low scenario", to "high scenarios" of 24.8 billion. One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.</p>
<p>There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and celebrate, the "Day of 5 Billion" on July 11, 1987, and the "Day of 6 Billion" on October 12, 1999. The "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Day_of_7_Billion" title="Day of 7 Billion">Day of 7 Billion</a>" was declared by the Population Division of the United Nations to be October 31, 2011.</p>

<p>As of 2012, the global <a href="/wiki/Human_sex_ratio" title="Human sex ratio">sex ratio</a> is approximately 1.01 males to 1 female.

<p>Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. This increase was due to a number of factors, including the lessening of the <a href="/wiki/Mortality_rate" title="Mortality rate">mortality rate</a> in many countries by improved sanitation and <a href="/wiki/History_of_medicine#Modern_medicine" title="History of medicine">medical advances</a>, and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>In 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people), down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. Globally, the population <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">growth rate</a> has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East, and <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>.</p>

<p>During the 2010s, Japan and some countries in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> began to encounter negative population growth (i.e. a <a href="/wiki/Net_(economics)" title="Net (economics)">net</a> decrease in population over time), due to <a href="/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility" title="Sub-replacement fertility">sub-replacement fertility</a> rates.</p>
<p>In 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global <a href="/wiki/Demographic_transition" title="Demographic transition">demographic transition</a>. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion. However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion. An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' "most likely scenario" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.</p>

<p>In 1975, <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_von_Hoerner" title="Sebastian von Hoerner">Sebastian von Hoerner</a> proposed a formula for population growth which represented <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolic_growth" title="Hyperbolic growth">hyperbolic growth</a> with an infinite population in 2025. The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance → increase in the <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on. The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the <a href="/wiki/Demographic_transition" title="Demographic transition">demographic transition</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Russian demographer <a href="/wiki/Sergey_Kapitsa" title="Sergey Kapitsa">Sergey Kapitsa</a>, the world population grew between 67,000 BCE and 1965 according to the following formula:</p>

<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><i>N</i> is current population</li>
<li><i>T</i> is the current year</li>
<li><i>C</i> = (1.86±0.01)·10</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Years_for_world_population_to_double">Years for world population to double</span></h3>
<p>According to linear interpolation and extrapolation of <a href="/wiki/World_population_estimates" title="World population estimates">UNDESA population estimates</a>, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the <a href="/wiki/2nd_millennium" title="2nd millennium">2nd millennium</a> CE, each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Predictions_of_scarcity">Predictions of scarcity</span></h3>

<p>In his 1798 work <i><a href="/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population" title="An Essay on the Principle of Population">An Essay on the Principle of Population</a></i>, the British scholar <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. The essay was written to refute what Malthus considered the unattainable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utopian" title="Utopian">utopian</a> ideas of <a href="/wiki/William_Godwin" title="William Godwin">William Godwin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet" title="Marquis de Condorcet">Marquis de Condorcet</a>, as presented in <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Political_Justice" title="Political Justice">Political Justice</a></i> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Future_Progress_of_the_Human_Mind" title="The Future Progress of the Human Mind">The Future Progress of the Human Mind</a></i>. In 1968, <a href="/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich" title="Paul R. Ehrlich">Paul R. Ehrlich</a> reprised Malthus' argument in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Population_Bomb" title="The Population Bomb">The Population Bomb</a></i>, predicting that mass global <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a> would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The predictions of Ehrlich and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neo-malthusianism" title="Neo-malthusianism">neo-Malthusians</a> were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Julian_Lincoln_Simon" title="Julian Lincoln Simon">Julian Lincoln Simon</a>, and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>, forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%. The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents. However, neo-Malthusians point out that the energy for the Green Revolution was provided by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>, in the form of natural gas-derived <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertilizers" title="Fertilizers">fertilizers</a>, oil-derived <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>-fueled <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>, and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.</p>
<p>In 2004, a meta-analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">sustainable limit to the world population</a> generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people.</p>


<p>In May 2008, the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a>, the increase of world <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_prices" title="Oil prices">oil prices</a> to over $140 per barrel ($880/m), global population growth, the effects of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development, and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_world_food_price_crisis" title="2007–2008 world food price crisis">Food riots</a> subsequently occurred in some countries. However, oil prices then fell sharply. Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines, but it is unclear whether mass <a href="/wiki/Food_waste" title="Food waste">food wastage</a> and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages.</p>
<p>David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people; its population as of 2015 is over 300 million. In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, Professor <a href="/wiki/John_Beddington" title="John Beddington">John Beddington</a>, warned that growing populations, falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a "perfect storm" of shortages of food, water, and energy by 2030. According to a 2009 report by the United Nations <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organisation" title="Food and Agriculture Organisation">Food and Agriculture Organisation</a> (FAO), the world will have to produce 70% more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people.</p>
<p>The observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, with 923 million undernourished in 2007, versus 832 million in 1995. The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase, to 1.02 billion.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impacts">Environmental impacts</span></h3>

<p>A number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world's <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>, as well as straining humanity's ability to feed itself. The <a href="/wiki/InterAcademy_Panel" title="InterAcademy Panel">InterAcademy Panel</a> <a href="/wiki/IAP_statement_on_population_growth" title="IAP statement on population growth">Statement on Population Growth</a>, which was ratified by 58 member <a href="/wiki/National_academy" title="National academy">national academies</a> in 1994, called the growth in human numbers "unprecedented", and stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_carbon_dioxide" title="Atmospheric carbon dioxide">atmospheric carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, and pollution, were aggravated by the population expansion. Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment. At the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion, and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_control">Population control</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_population_control" title="Human population control">Human population control</a></div>

<p>Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's <a href="/wiki/Birth_rate" title="Birth rate">birth rate</a>, by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">environmental concerns</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religious reasons</a>. The use of <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a> in some population control strategies has caused controversy, with religious organizations such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Nebraska" title="University of Nebraska">University of Nebraska</a> publication <i>Green Illusions</i> argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that "Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet." The book <i>Fatal Misconception</i> by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overpopulation_skepticism">Overpopulation skepticism</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Population_Research_Institute" title="Population Research Institute">Population Research Institute</a> (PRI), an anti-abortion, anti-contraception advocacy group, has criticised predictions of overpopulation and attendant resource scarcity, with some describing overpopulation as a "myth". The PRI argues that advances in agricultural, medical, and industrial technology have allowed global economic productivity to keep pace with rising populations despite Malthusian predictions to the contrary. PRI further says that family sizes are naturally declining worldwide due to higher living standards, increased availability of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contraception" title="Contraception">contraception</a> and better economic opportunities for women. However, other commentators have described PRI's arguments on overpopulation as deceptive.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Number_of_humans_who_have_ever_lived">Number of humans who have ever lived</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Paleodemography" title="Paleodemography">Paleodemography</a></div>
<p>Estimates of the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1E11" title="1E11">100 billion</a>. Estimates of this kind cannot hope to give more than the rough order of magnitude, as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties of the order of 3% to 5%. Kapitzka (1996) cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion.Another such estimate was prepared by Haub (1995), updated in 2002 and 2011; the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion. Haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required "selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period".</p>
<p>The very small size of the world population in prehistoric times (as compared to its current size) facilitates this kind of estimate with regard to the <a href="/wiki/Sorites_paradox" title="Sorites paradox">semantic difficulty</a> of deciding the precise meaning of "human" (in the context <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archaic_Homo_sapiens" title="Archaic Homo sapiens">early <i>Homo sapiens</i></a>). More importantly, robust population data only exist for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Census_in_Egypt" title="Census in Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire" title="Achaemenid Empire">Persian Empire</a>, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service. Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.</p>
<p>Another critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern <a href="/wiki/Infant_mortality" title="Infant mortality">infant mortality</a> rates; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records. Haub (1995) estimates that around 40% of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday. Haub also stated that "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_expectancy_at_birth" title="Life expectancy at birth">life expectancy at birth</a> probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history".</p>
