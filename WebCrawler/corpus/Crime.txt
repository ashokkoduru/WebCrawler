<p>In ordinary language, a <b>crime</b> is an unlawful act punishable by a <a href="/wiki/Forms_of_government" title="Forms of government">state</a> or other authority. The term "crime" does not, in modern <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law" title="Criminal law">criminal law</a>, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statutory" title="Statutory">statutory</a> definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a <a href="/wiki/Category_of_being" title="Category of being">category</a> created by <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a>; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence</b> (or <b>criminal offence</b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state ("a public <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wrong" title="Wrong">wrong</a>"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.</p>
<p>The notion that acts such as <a href="/wiki/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">rape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a> are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law" title="Criminal law">criminal law</a> of each <a href="/wiki/Country" title="Country">country</a>.

<p>The state (<a href="/wiki/Forms_of_government" title="Forms of government">government</a>) has the power to severely restrict one's <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a> for committing a crime.

<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (<i><a href="/wiki/Actus_reus" title="Actus reus">actus reus</a></i>) must – with <a href="/wiki/Strict_liability" title="Strict liability">certain exceptions</a> – be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (<i><a href="/wiki/Mens_rea" title="Mens rea">mens rea</a></i>).</p>
<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of <a href="/wiki/Private_law" title="Private law">private law</a> (<a href="/wiki/Tort" title="Tort">torts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Breach_of_contract" title="Breach of contract">breaches of contract</a>) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through <a href="/wiki/Civil_procedure" title="Civil procedure">civil procedure</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>crime</i> is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> root <i>cernō</i>, meaning "I decide, I give judgment". Originally the Latin word <i>crīmen</i> meant "<a href="/wiki/Criminal_charge" title="Criminal charge">charge</a>" or "cry of distress." The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word <i>krima</i> (κρίμα), from which the Latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.</p>
<p>In 13th century <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> <i>crime</i> meant "sinfulness", according to <a href="/wiki/Online_Etymology_Dictionary" title="Online Etymology Dictionary">etymonline.com</a>. It was probably brought to England as Old French <i>crimne</i> (12th century form of <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">Modern French</a> <i>crime</i>), from Latin <i>crimen</i> (in the genitive case: <i>criminis</i>). In Latin, <i>crimen</i> could have signified any one of the following: "<a href="/wiki/Criminal_charge" title="Criminal charge">charge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indictment" title="Indictment">indictment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Criminal_accusation" title="Criminal accusation">accusation</a>; crime, <a href="/wiki/Fault_(legal)" title="Fault (legal)">fault</a>, offense".</p>
<p>The word may derive from the Latin <i>cernere</i> – "to decide, to sift" (see <a href="/wiki/Crisis" title="Crisis">crisis</a>, mapped on <a href="/wiki/Kairos" title="Kairos">Kairos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chronos" title="Chronos">Chronos</a>). But <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Klein" title="Ernest Klein">Ernest Klein</a> (citing <a href="/wiki/Karl_Brugmann" title="Karl Brugmann">Karl Brugmann</a>) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant "cry of distress". Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in "<a href="/wiki/Crying" title="Crying">cry</a>" words and refers to English <a href="/wiki/Plaintiff" title="Plaintiff">plaint</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plaintiff" title="Plaintiff">plaintiff</a>, and so on. The meaning "offense punishable by law" dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is <a href="/wiki/Gloss_(annotation)" title="Gloss (annotation)">glossed</a> in Old English by <i>facen</i>, also "deceit, fraud, treachery", [cf. fake]. <i>Crime wave</i> is first attested in 1893 in <a href="/wiki/American_English" title="American English">American English</a>.</p>

<p>A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">normative</a> <a href="/wiki/Definition" title="Definition">definition</a> views crime as <a href="/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)" title="Deviance (sociology)">deviant behavior</a> that violates prevailing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">norms</a> – <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">cultural</a> standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">social</a>, <a href="/wiki/Politics" title="Politics">political</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychological</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economic</a> conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">law-enforcement</a>, and penal responses made by society.</p>
<p>These <a href="/wiki/Structuralism" title="Structuralism">structural</a> realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Criminalisation" title="Criminalisation">criminalise</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decriminalisation" title="Decriminalisation">decriminalise</a> certain behaviours, which directly affects the <a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistical</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crime_rate" title="Crime rate">crime rates</a>, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Laws" title="Laws">laws</a>, and (re-)influence the general <a href="/wiki/Public_opinion" title="Public opinion">public opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given "crime problem". All such adjustments to <a href="/wiki/Crime_statistics" title="Crime statistics">crime statistics</a>, allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the State should use law or <a href="/wiki/Social_engineering_(political_science)" title="Social engineering (political science)">social engineering</a> to enforce or encourage any particular <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_norm" title="Social norm">social norm</a>. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Indeed, in those cases where no clear <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consensus" title="Consensus">consensus</a> exists on a given norm, the drafting of <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law" title="Criminal law">criminal law</a> by the group in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_(sociology)" title="Power (sociology)">power</a> to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's <a href="/wiki/Political_freedom" title="Political freedom">freedom</a>, and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general – whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criminalization">Criminalization</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Criminalization" title="Criminalization">Criminalization</a></div>

<p>One can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a <a href="/wiki/Deterrence_(legal)" title="Deterrence (legal)">deterrent</a> to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The State becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a>, for example, to minimize harm to others).</p>
<p>Criminalization may provide future harm reduction at least to the outside population, assuming those shamed or incarcerated or otherwise restrained for committing crimes start out more prone to criminal behaviour. Likewise, one might assume that criminalizing acts that in themselves do not harm other people ("<a href="/wiki/Victimless_crime" title="Victimless crime">victimless crimes</a>") may prevent subsequent harmful acts (assuming that people "prone" to commit these acts may tend to commit harmful actions in general). Some see the criminalization of "victimless crimes" as a pretext for imposing personal, religious or moral convictions on otherwise productive citizens or taxpayers.</p>
<p>Some commentators may see criminalization as a way to make potential criminals <a href="/wiki/Payment" title="Payment">pay</a> or suffer for their prospective crimes. In this case, criminalization becomes a way to set the price that one must pay to society for certain actions considered detrimental to society as a whole. An extreme view might see criminalization as State-sanctioned <a href="/wiki/Revenge" title="Revenge">revenge</a>.</p>
<p>States control the process of criminalization because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if <a href="/wiki/Victimology" title="Victimology">victims</a> recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the State often have better access to expertise and resources.</li>
<li>The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for <a href="/wiki/Deterrence_(psychology)" title="Deterrence (psychology)">deterrence</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Fear" title="Fear">Fear</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Retaliate" title="Retaliate">retaliation</a> may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trial_(law)" title="Trial (law)">trial</a>.</li>
<li>Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court. Garoupa &amp; Klerman (2002) warn that a <a href="/wiki/Rent-seeking" title="Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a> government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a <a href="/wiki/Social_welfare_function" title="Social welfare function">social-welfare</a>-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.</li>
<li>As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.</li>
</ul>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Labeling_theory#The_.22criminal.22" title="Labeling theory">Labeling theory § The "criminal"</a></div>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Labeling_theory" title="Labeling theory">label</a> of "crime" and the accompanying <a href="/wiki/Social_stigma" title="Social stigma">social stigma</a> normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the State, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of "crime" or "criminal" intend to assert the <a href="/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the State (in the event that <a href="/wiki/Due_process" title="Due process">standard processing</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trial_(law)" title="Trial (law)">tries</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conviction_(law)" title="Conviction (law)">convicts</a> an accused person of a crime).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural-law_theory">Natural-law theory</span></h2>
<p>Justifying the State's use of <a href="/wiki/Coercion" title="Coercion">force</a> to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of <a href="/wiki/Natural_law" title="Natural law">natural law</a>. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a> or constructs them. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> wrote in the 13th century: "the rule and measure of human acts is the <a href="/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reason</a>, which is the first principle of human acts" (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I). He regarded people as by nature <a href="/wiki/Rationality" title="Rationality">rational</a> beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s <a href="/wiki/William_Blackstone" title="William Blackstone">William Blackstone</a> (1979: 41) described the thesis:</p>

<p>But <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Austin_(legal_philosophy)" title="John Austin (legal philosophy)">John Austin</a> (1790–1859), an early <a href="/wiki/Legal_positivism" title="Legal positivism">positivist</a>, applied <a href="/wiki/Utilitarianism" title="Utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a> in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/H._L._A._Hart" title="H. L. A. Hart">Hart</a> (1961) saw the law as an aspect of <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a>, with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.</p>
<p>Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Consistency" title="Consistency">consistency</a>, and that the state's agents used state power with <a href="/wiki/Social_responsibility" title="Social responsibility">responsibility</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Dworkin" title="Ronald Dworkin">Ronald Dworkin</a> (2005) rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of <a href="/wiki/Deference" title="Deference">deference</a> (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.</p>
<p>Indeed, despite everything, the majority of natural-law theorists have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law. This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.</p>
<p>One can solve this problem by granting some degree of <a href="/wiki/Moral_relativism" title="Moral relativism">moral relativism</a> and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of State power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of <a href="/wiki/Individual_and_group_rights" title="Individual and group rights">individual rights</a>.</p>
<p>Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term "<a href="/wiki/Rights" title="Rights">right</a>") rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> illustrates this view, saying that a <a href="/wiki/Smuggling" title="Smuggling">smuggler</a> would be an excellent citizen, "...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so."</p>
<p>Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between "criminality" (which derives from human nature) and "illegality" (which originates with the interests of those in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_(sociology)" title="Power (sociology)">power</a>). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases <i><a href="/wiki/Malum_in_se" title="Malum in se">malum in se</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Malum_prohibitum" title="Malum prohibitum">malum prohibitum</a></i> respectively. They regard a "crime <i>malum in se</i>" as inherently criminal; whereas a "crime <i>malum prohibitum</i>" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.</p>
<p>It follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American <a href="/wiki/List_of_national_founders" title="List of national founders">Founding Fathers</a>) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called <a href="/wiki/Liberalism#Classical_and_modern" title="Liberalism">classical liberals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarians</a>.</p>

Many states at this time functioned as <a href="/wiki/Theocracy" title="Theocracy">theocracies</a>, with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference. In the Sanskrit texts of <a href="/wiki/Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra" title="Dharmaśāstra">Dharmaśāstra</a> (c.<span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 1250 BC</span>), issues such as legal and religious duties, code of conduct, penalties and remedies, etc. have been discussed and forms one of the elaborate and earliest source of legal code.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_Henry_Maine" title="Sir Henry Maine">Sir Henry Maine</a> (1861) studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the "modern" sense of the word. While modern systems distinguish between offences against the "State" or "community", and offences against the "individual", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with "crimes" (Latin: <i>crimina</i>), but with "wrongs" (Latin: <i>delicta</i>). Thus the Hellenic laws treated all forms of <a href="/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, <a href="/wiki/Assault" title="Assault">assault</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">rape</a>, and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> systematized law and applied their system across the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Again, the initial rules of <a href="/wiki/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. The most significant Roman law concept involved <i>dominion</i>. The <i><a href="/wiki/Pater_familias" title="Pater familias">pater familias</a></i> owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the <i>pater</i> enforced matters involving interference with any property. The <i>Commentaries</i> of <a href="/wiki/Gaius_(jurist)" title="Gaius (jurist)">Gaius</a> (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Tables" title="Twelve Tables">Twelve Tables</a> treated <i>furtum</i> (in modern parlance: "theft") as a <a href="/wiki/Tort" title="Tort">tort</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, assault and violent <a href="/wiki/Robbery" title="Robbery">robbery</a> involved <a href="/wiki/Trespass" title="Trespass">trespass</a> as to the <i>pater's</i> property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the <i>pater</i> as having trespassed on his "property"), and breach of such laws created a <i>vinculum juris</i> (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern "<a href="/wiki/Damages" title="Damages">damages</a>") could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Germanic_law" title="Germanic law">Teutonic laws</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Germanic_tribes" title="Germanic tribes">Germanic tribes</a>, included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would now consider the complete range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.</p>
<p>Even though Rome abandoned its <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Britannic provinces</a> around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries – who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in Britannia – acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_kings" title="Anglo-Saxon kings">Anglo-Saxon kings</a>. But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman invasion</a>, and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the "individual", but also as a wrong against the "State".</p>
<p>This idea came from <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a>, and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the "State" had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or <i>privilegium</i> against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/King" title="King">king</a> wanted to raise money by selling a new form of <a href="/wiki/Writ" title="Writ">writ</a>). The development of the idea that the "State" dispenses <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">justice</a> in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>In continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church. Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman <a href="/wiki/Jurisprudence" title="Jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a>, but modified to meet the prevailing <a href="/wiki/Political_climate" title="Political climate">political climate</a>.</p>
<p>In Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the <i><a href="/wiki/Thing_(assembly)" title="Thing (assembly)">things</a></i> – the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of "the people" of yore.</p>
<p>From the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of <a href="/wiki/Feud" title="Feud">feuding</a> between <a href="/wiki/Clan" title="Clan">clans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Family" title="Family">families</a>. If compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of <a href="/wiki/Endemic_warfare" title="Endemic warfare">feudal warfare</a>. Both in archaic Greece and in <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him not guilty. (Compare the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, in which the <a href="/wiki/Veto" title="Veto">veto</a> power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)</p>
<p>These means of restraining private <a href="/wiki/Feud" title="Feud">feuds</a> did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the "state" did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.</p>
<p>The development of <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociological</a> thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of <a href="/wiki/Criminology" title="Criminology">criminology</a> as a study of crime in society. <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> noted a link between crime and <a href="/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a> – in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy" title="The Birth of Tragedy">The Birth of Tragedy</a></i> he asserted: "The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime". In the 20th century <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish" title="Discipline and Punish">Discipline and Punish</a></i> made a study of <a href="/wiki/Criminalization" title="Criminalization">criminalization</a> as a coercive method of state control.</p>

<p>Emotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. The positive psychology concept of Broaden and Build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional state declines. In positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. The narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.</p>

<p>Different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience.
