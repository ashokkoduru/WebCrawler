<p>A <b>hydrogen vehicle</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">vehicle</a> that uses <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> as its onboard fuel for <a href="/wiki/Motive_power" title="Motive power">motive power</a>. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_rocket" title="Space rocket">space rockets</a>, as well as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobiles</a> and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_energy" title="Chemical energy">chemical energy</a> of hydrogen to <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_energy" title="Mechanical energy">mechanical energy</a> either by burning hydrogen in an <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a>, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a <a href="/wiki/Fuel_cell" title="Fuel cell">fuel cell</a> to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_economy" title="Hydrogen economy">hydrogen economy</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. It can be produced using renewable sources, but that is an expensive process. Integrated wind-to-hydrogen (<a href="/wiki/Power_to_gas" title="Power to gas">power to gas</a>) plants, using <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water" title="Electrolysis of water">electrolysis of water</a>, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with traditional energy sources.</p>
<p>Many companies are working to develop technologies that might efficiently exploit the potential of hydrogen energy for use in <a href="/wiki/Motor_vehicle" title="Motor vehicle">motor vehicles</a>. As of November 2013 there are demonstration fleets of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles undergoing field testing including the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Equinox_Fuel_Cell" title="Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell">Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honda_FCX_Clarity" title="Honda FCX Clarity">Honda FCX Clarity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hyundai_ix35_FCEV" title="Hyundai ix35 FCEV">Hyundai ix35 FCEV</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_B-Class_F-Cell" title="Mercedes-Benz B-Class F-Cell">Mercedes-Benz B-Class F-Cell</a>. The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high carbon emissions intensity when produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, low energy content per unit volume, low performance of fuel cell vehicles compared with gasoline vehicles, production and compression of hydrogen, and the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles.</p>

The car has a range of 312 mi (502 km) and takes about five minutes to refill its hydrogen tank. The initial sale price in Japan was about 7 million yen ($69,000). Former European Parliament President <a href="/wiki/Pat_Cox" title="Pat Cox">Pat Cox</a> estimates that Toyota will initially lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold. Many automobile companies have introduced demonstration models in limited numbers (see <a href="/wiki/List_of_fuel_cell_vehicles" title="List of fuel cell vehicles">list of fuel cell vehicles</a>).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fork_trucks">Fork trucks</span></h3>

The first production HICE forklift truck based on the Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hannover" title="Hannover">Hannover</a> on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, 43 kW (58 hp) diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and <a href="/wiki/Fuel_injection#Direct_injection" title="Fuel injection">direct injection</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Fuel_cell_forklift" title="Fuel cell forklift">fuel cell forklift</a> (also called a fuel cell lift truck or a fuel cell forklift) is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck. In 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in <a href="/wiki/Material_handling" title="Material handling">material handling</a> in the US. Only 500 of these received funding from <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">DOE</a> in 2012. The global market is 1 million fork lifts per year. As of 2013, fuel cell fleets are being operated by several of companies, including Sysco Foods, FedEx Freight, GENCO (at Wegmans, Coca-Cola, Kimberly Clark, and Whole Foods), and H-E-B Grocers. A total of 30 fuel cell forklifts with Hylift were demonstrated in Europe and extended it with HyLIFT-EUROPE to 200 units. With other projects in France and <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>. Pike Research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020.</p>
<p>Most companies in Europe and the US do not use petroleum powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts. Fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes. Fuel cell-powered forklifts can be used in refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The FC units are often designed as drop-in replacements.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rockets">Rockets</span></h3>
<p>Many large <a href="/wiki/Rocket" title="Rocket">rockets</a> use <a href="/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen" title="Liquid hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> as fuel, with <a href="/wiki/Liquid_oxygen" title="Liquid oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> as an oxidizer. An advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Effective_exhaust_velocity" title="Effective exhaust velocity">effective exhaust velocity</a> compared to <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LOX" title="LOX">LOX</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UDMH" title="UDMH">UDMH</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogen_tetroxide" title="Nitrogen tetroxide">NTO</a> engines. According to the <a href="/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation" title="Tsiolkovsky rocket equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>, a rocket with higher exhaust velocity needs less propellant mass to achieve a given change of speed. Before combustion, the hydrogen runs through cooling pipes around the <a href="/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle" title="Rocket engine nozzle">exhaust nozzle</a> to protect the nozzle from damage by the hot exhaust gases. Also the energy content or <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a> of hydrogen calculated from weight is the best compared to any other chemical energy storage. In combination with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen yields the highest specific impulse, or efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed, of any known rocket propellant.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of LH2/LOX engines are the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly. Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due to the constant hydrogen boil-off, the rocket can only be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ICBM" title="ICBM">ICBMs</a> and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations.</p>
<p>Overall, the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage, however, the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less, which makes it particularly effective for upper stages, since they are carried by the lower stages. For first stages, dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage, due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag.</p>
<p>Liquid hydrogen and oxygen were also used in the <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems. The byproduct of the fuel cell is water, which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogen">Hydrogen</span></h2>
<p>Hydrogen does not come as a pre-existing source of <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> like <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>, but is first produced and then stored as a carrier, much like a <a href="/wiki/Battery_(electricity)" title="Battery (electricity)">battery</a>. A suggested benefit of large-scale deployment of hydrogen vehicles is that it could lead to decreased emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone precursors. However, as of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from methane. It can be produced using renewable sources, but that is an expensive process. Integrated wind-to-hydrogen (<a href="/wiki/Power_to_gas" title="Power to gas">power to gas</a>) plants, using <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water" title="Electrolysis of water">electrolysis of water</a>, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with traditional energy sources.</p>
<p>According to Ford Motor Company, "when FCVs are run on hydrogen reformed from natural gas using this process, they do not provide significant environmental benefits on a well-to-wheels basis (due to GHG emissions from the natural gas reformation process)." While methods of hydrogen production that do not use fossil fuel would be more sustainable, currently renewable energy represents only a small percentage of energy generated, and power produced from renewable sources can be used in electric vehicles and for non-vehicle applications.</p>
<p>The challenges facing the use of hydrogen in vehicles include production, storage, transport and distribution. The well-to-wheel efficiency for hydrogen is less than 25%. A study sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy said in 2004 that the well-to-wheel efficiency of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles is even less.</p>

Hydrogen can also be produced from <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a> by <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> at working efficiencies in the 50–60% range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65–70% for the larger plants. Hydrogen can also be made by chemical reduction using chemical hydrides or aluminum. Current technologies for manufacturing hydrogen use energy in various forms, totaling between 25 and 50 percent of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Higher_heating_value" title="Higher heating value">higher heating value</a> of the hydrogen fuel, used to produce, compress or liquefy, and transmit the hydrogen by pipeline or truck.</p>
<p>Environmental consequences of the production of hydrogen from fossil energy resources include the emission of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a>, a consequence that would also result from the on-board reforming of methanol into hydrogen. Analyses comparing the environmental consequences of hydrogen production and use in fuel-cell vehicles to the refining of petroleum and combustion in conventional automobile engines do not agree on whether a net reduction of ozone and greenhouse gases would result. Hydrogen production using renewable energy resources would not create such emissions, but the scale of renewable energy production would need to be expanded to be used in producing hydrogen for a significant part of transportation needs. As of 2015, 33 percent of U.S. electricity was produced from renewable sources (including 7% from hydro and 20% from nuclear). In a few countries, renewable sources are being used more widely to produce energy and hydrogen. For example, <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> is using geothermal power to produce hydrogen, and <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> is using wind.</p>

<p>According to GM, 70% of the U.S. population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little access to hydrogen, despite its wide availability for commercial use. The distribution of hydrogen fuel for vehicles throughout the U.S. would require new hydrogen stations that would cost, by some estimates approximately 20 billion dollars and 4.6 billion in the EU. Other estimates place the cost as high as half trillion dollars in the United States alone.</p>
<p>As of 2016, there are 23 publicly accessible <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_station" title="Hydrogen station">hydrogen refueling stations</a> in the USA, 20 of which are <a href="/wiki/California_Hydrogen_Highway" title="California Hydrogen Highway">located in California</a>. They are mainly sourced by natural gas.</p>

<p>In 2003, <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> announced an initiative to promote hydrogen powered vehicles. In 2009, President Obama and his Department of Energy Secretary <a href="/wiki/Steven_Chu" title="Steven Chu">Steven Chu</a> stripped the funding of fuel cell technology due to their belief that the technology was still decades away. Under heavy criticism, the funding was partially restored. In 2014 the Obama administration announced they want to speed up production and development of hydrogen powered vehicles. The press release states that, “by partnering with a private sector, the Obama administration thinks that it can create success stories and help speed up the process”. The Department of Energy is spreading a $7.2 million investment to the states of Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems. Companies like The Center for Transportation and The Environment, Fed Ex Express, Air Products and Chemicals, and Sprint are invested in the development of these fuel cells. Fuel cells could also be used in handling equipment such as forklifts as well as telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>Senator Byron L. Dorgan stated in 2013: “The Energy and Water Appropriations bill makes investments in our nation’s efforts to develop safe, homegrown energy sources that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil. And, because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies, this bill also restores funding for Hydrogen energy research”. Much work has been done in developing these fuel cell cars. The U.S. Department of Energy supports next generation fuel cell systems and they are the nations lead innovative clean energy technologies. In June 2013 the DOE gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up the technology and another 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes, $3 million for Minnesota-based 3M to work on membranes with improved durability and performance, and 1.5 million for the Colorado School of Mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Critics claim the time frame for overcoming the technical and economic challenges to implementing wide-scale use of hydrogen cars is likely to last for at least several decades, and hydrogen vehicles may never become broadly available. They claim that the focus on the use of the hydrogen car is a dangerous detour from more readily available solutions to reducing the use of fossil fuels in vehicles. In May 2008, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wired_News" title="Wired News">Wired News</a></i> reported that "experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming, and we can't afford to wait that long. In the meantime, fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions."</p>
<p>K. G. Duleep commented that "a strong case exists for continuing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fuel-efficiency" title="Fuel-efficiency">fuel-efficiency</a> improvements from conventional technology at relatively low cost." Critiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary, <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" title="Who Killed the Electric Car?">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a></i>. According to former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Energy" title="U.S. Department of Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a> official <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Romm" title="Joseph Romm">Joseph Romm</a>, "A hydrogen car is one of the least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases." Asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available, Romm replied: "Not in our lifetime, and very possibly never." The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote, in February 2009, "Hydrogen fuel-cell technology won't work in cars. ... Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars."</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/The_Economist" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> magazine, in September 2008, quoted <a href="/wiki/Robert_Zubrin" title="Robert Zubrin">Robert Zubrin</a>, the author of <i><a href="/wiki/Energy_Victory" title="Energy Victory">Energy Victory</a></i>, as saying: "Hydrogen is 'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel'". The magazine noted the withdrawal of California from earlier goals: "In March [2008] the <a href="/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board" title="California Air Resources Board">California Air Resources Board</a>, an agency of California's state government and a bellwether for state governments across America, changed its requirement for the number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zero-emission_vehicle" title="Zero-emission vehicle">zero-emission vehicles</a> (ZEVs) to be built and sold in California between 2012 and 2014. The revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles." The magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today's gasoline cars. On the other hand, if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, "it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles."</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> asked in November 2009, "But why would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries"?. A December 2009 study at <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis" title="University of California, Davis">UC Davis</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Power Sources</i>, found that, over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles. This agrees with a 2014 analysis. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Motley_Fool" title="The Motley Fool">The Motley Fool</a></i> stated in 2013 that "there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production."</p>
<p>Volkswagen's Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that "no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity." He elaborated: "Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen "with low efficiencies" where "you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. "And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss". Krebs continued: "in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent." <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Business_Insider" title="The Business Insider">The Business Insider</a></i> commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pure hydrogen can be industrially derived, but it takes energy. If that energy does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure. Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before FCEVs become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Joseph Romm devoted three articles to updating his critiques of hydrogen vehicles. He states that FCVs still have not overcome the following issues: high cost of the vehicles, high fueling cost, and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure. "It would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades." Most importantly, he says, "FCVs aren't green" because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced, as 95% of it is, using the steam reforming process. He concludes that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet "either now or in the future." <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GreenTech_Media" title="GreenTech Media">GreenTech Media</a>'s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, <i>Clean Technica</i> listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So did <i><a href="/wiki/Car_Throttle" title="Car Throttle">Car Throttle</a></i>. Another <i>Clean Technica</i> writer concluded, "while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage (especially seasonal storage), it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles."</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle" title="Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle">Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles</a>, or PHEVs, are <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle" title="Hybrid vehicle">hybrid vehicles</a> that can be plugged into the electric grid and contain an electric motor and also an <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a>. The PHEV concept augments standard <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicles" title="Hybrid electric vehicles">hybrid electric vehicles</a> with the ability to recharge their batteries from an external source, enabling increased use of the vehicle's electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines. The infrastructure required to charge PHEVs is already in place, and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93% efficient. This, however, is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels. AC/DC conversion must take place from the grids AC supply to the PHEV's DC. This is roughly 98% efficient. The battery then must be charged. As of 2007, the <a href="/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery" title="Lithium iron phosphate battery">Lithium iron phosphate battery</a> was between 80-90% efficient in charging/discharging. The battery needs to be cooled; the GM Volt's battery has 4 coolers and two radiators. As of 2009, "the total well-to-wheels efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20% (although that number could rise to 25% or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy). The well-to-wheels efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a PHEV or EV, however, is 80% (and could be higher in the future)—four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways." A 2006 article in <i><a href="/wiki/Scientific_American" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i> argued that PHEVs, rather than hydrogen vehicles, would become standard in the automobile industry. A December 2009 study at UC Davis found that, over their lifetimes, PHEVs will emit less carbon than current vehicles, while hydrogen cars will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric car</a></div>
<p>A 2008 <i>Technology Review</i> article stated, "Electric cars—and plug-in hybrid cars—have an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity. That is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process, from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances, getting the hydrogen in the car, and then running it through a fuel cell—all for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor you'll find in an electric car." Thermodynamically, each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process.</p>
<p>A 2013 comparison of hydrogen and <a href="/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle" title="Battery electric vehicle">battery electric vehicles</a> agreed with the 25% figure from Ulf Bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an <a href="/wiki/Electric_vehicle_battery" title="Electric vehicle battery">electric vehicle battery</a> "is rapidly coming down, and the gap will widen further", while there is little "existing infrastructure to transport, store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place, everyone's household power sockets are "electric vehicle refueling" station and the "cost of electricity (depending on the source) is at least 75% cheaper than hydrogen." In 2013 the <a href="/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> and DOE stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below $17,000 ($200–$250/kWh) on 300 miles of range. In 2013 Matthew Mench, from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Tennessee" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a> stated "If we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now, we are going to be waiting for a long time". Navigant Research, (formerly Pike research), on the other hand, forecasts that “lithium-ion costs, which are tipping the scales at about $500 per kilowatt hour now, could fall to $300 by 2015 and to $180 by 2020.” In 2013 Takeshi Uchiyamada, a designer of the <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Prius" title="Toyota Prius">Toyota Prius</a> stated: "Because of its shortcomings – driving range, cost and recharging time – the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars".</p>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric car</a> designs offer limited driving range causing <a href="/wiki/Range_anxiety" title="Range anxiety">range anxiety</a>. For example, the 2013 <a href="/wiki/Nissan_Leaf" title="Nissan Leaf">Nissan Leaf</a> has a range of 75 mi (121 km), the 2014 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_B-Class_Electric_Drive" title="Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive">Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive</a> has an estimated range of 115 mi (185 km) and the <a href="/wiki/Tesla_Model_S" title="Tesla Model S">Tesla Model S</a> has a range of up to 265 mi (426 km). However, most US commutes are 30–40 miles (48–64 km) miles per day round trip and in Europe most commutes are around 20 kilometres (12 mi) round-trip</p>
<p>In 2013, <i>The New York Times</i> stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen filling stations in the U.S., eight of which are in Southern California, and that BEVs' cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars, when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station. The <i>Times</i> commented: "By the time Toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan, there will be about a half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the United States – and tens of thousands of E.V. charging stations." In 2013 John Swanton of the <a href="/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board" title="California Air Resources Board">California Air Resources Board</a>, who sees them as complementary technologies, stated that EVs have the jump on fuel-cell autos, which "are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago.
