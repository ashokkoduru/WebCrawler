<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Throop_College">Throop College</span></h3>

<p>Caltech started as a <a href="/wiki/Vocational_school" title="Vocational school">vocational school</a> founded in Pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician <a href="/wiki/Amos_G._Throop" title="Amos G. Throop">Amos G. Throop</a>. The school was known successively as <b>Throop University</b>, <b>Throop Polytechnic Institute</b> (and Manual Training School), and <b>Throop College of Technology</b>, before acquiring its current name in 1920. The vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form an independent <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic_School" title="Polytechnic School">Polytechnic School</a> in 1907.</p>
<p>At a time when scientific research in the United States was still in its infancy, <a href="/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale" title="George Ellery Hale">George Ellery Hale</a>, a solar astronomer from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, founded the <a href="/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory" title="Mount Wilson Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a> in 1904. He joined Throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of <a href="/wiki/James_Augustin_Brown_Scherer" title="James Augustin Brown Scherer">James A. B. Scherer</a>, a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser, to Throop's presidency in 1908. Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W. Gates to donate $25,000 in seed money to build Gates Laboratory, the first science building on campus.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="World_Wars">World Wars</span></h3>
<p>In 1910, Throop moved to its current site. Arther Fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site. <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> delivered an address at Throop Institute on March 21, 1911, and he declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to see institutions like Throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them; I want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a> and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country—and the one-hundredth man I want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer, George Ellery Hale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same year, a bill was introduced in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/California_Legislature" title="California Legislature">California Legislature</a> calling for the establishment of a publicly funded "California Institute of Technology", with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of Throop at the time. The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California" title="University of California">University of California</a> successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of the World War II necessitated the broader development of research-based science education. The promise of Throop attracted <a href="/wiki/Physical_chemistry" title="Physical chemistry">physical chemist</a> <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Amos_Noyes" title="Arthur Amos Noyes">Arthur Amos Noyes</a> from <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a> to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology.</p>
<p>With the onset of World War I, Hale organized the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council" title="United States National Research Council">National Research Council</a> to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. President Scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the National Research Council, Hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs, and for Throop to play a national role in science. The new funds were designated for physics research, and ultimately led to the establishment of the Norman Bridge Laboratory, which attracted experimental <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physicist</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Andrews_Millikan" title="Robert Andrews Millikan">Robert Andrews Millikan</a> from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in 1917. During the course of the war, Hale, Noyes and Millikan worked together in Washington on the NRC. Subsequently, they continued their partnership in developing Caltech.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Hale, Noyes and Millikan (aided by the booming economy of <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a>), Caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s and concentrated on the development of Roosevelt's "Hundredth Man". On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time "to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research." In 1923, Millikan was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_Bennett_Munro" title="William Bennett Munro">William Bennett Munro</a>, then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, to create a division of <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">humanities</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_science" title="Social science">social sciences</a> at Caltech. In 1928, a division of <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> was established under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan" title="Thomas Hunt Morgan">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a>, the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" title="Chromosome">chromosome</a> in heredity. In 1930, <a href="/wiki/Kerckhoff_Marine_Laboratory" title="Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory">Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory</a> was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of <a href="/wiki/Aeronautics" title="Aeronautics">aeronautics</a> was created, which eventually attracted <a href="/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n" title="Theodore von Kármán">Theodore von Kármán</a>. Kármán later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for <a href="/wiki/Rocket" title="Rocket">rocket science</a>. In 1928, construction of the <a href="/wiki/Palomar_Observatory" title="Palomar Observatory">Palomar Observatory</a> began.</p>

<p>Millikan served as "Chairman of the Executive Council" (effectively Caltech's president) from 1921 to 1945, and his influence was such that the Institute was occasionally referred to as "Millikan's School." Millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining Caltech. Scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as <a href="/wiki/Paul_Dirac" title="Paul Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" title="Erwin Schrödinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" title="Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz" title="Hendrik Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>. <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> arrived on the Caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theory_of_General_Relativity" title="Theory of General Relativity">Theory of General Relativity</a>, and he returned to Caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933.</p>
<p>During World War II, Caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the <a href="/wiki/V-12_Navy_College_Training_Program" title="V-12 Navy College Training Program">V-12 Navy College Training Program</a> which offered students a path to a Navy commission. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> also maintained a naval training school for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aeronautical_engineering" title="Aeronautical engineering">aeronautical engineering</a>, resident inspectors of ordnance and naval material, and a liaison officer to the <a href="/wiki/National_Defense_Research_Committee" title="National Defense Research Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> on campus.</p>

<p>During <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lee_A._DuBridge" title="Lee A. DuBridge">Lee A. DuBridge</a>'s tenure as Caltech's president (1946–1969), Caltech's faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size. DuBridge, unlike his predecessors, welcomed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Federal_funding" title="Federal funding">federal funding</a> of science. New research fields flourished, including <a href="/wiki/Chemical_biology" title="Chemical biology">chemical biology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Planetary_science" title="Planetary science">planetary science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_astrophysics" title="Nuclear astrophysics">nuclear astrophysics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Geochemistry" title="Geochemistry">geochemistry</a>. A 200-inch telescope was dedicated on nearby Palomar Mountain in 1948 and remained the world's most powerful optical telescope for over forty years.</p>
<p>Caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of <a href="/wiki/Harold_Brown_(Secretary_of_Defense)" title="Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)">Harold Brown</a> in 1970, and they made up 14% of the entering class. The fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then.</p>
<p>Caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politics that there has been only one organized student protest in January 1968 outside the Burbank studios of <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>, in response to rumors that NBC was to cancel <a href="/wiki/Star_Trek" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>. In 1973, the students from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dabney_House" title="Dabney House">Dabney House</a> protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase "<a href="/wiki/Watergate_scandal" title="Watergate scandal">Impeach Nixon</a>". The following week, Ross McCollum, president of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Oil_Company" title="National Oil Company">National Oil Company</a>, wrote an open letter to Dabney House stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to Caltech. The Dabney family, being Republicans, disowned Dabney House after hearing of the prank.</p>

<p>Since 2000, the <a href="/wiki/Einstein_Papers_Project" title="Einstein Papers Project">Einstein Papers Project</a> has been located at Caltech. The project was established in 1986 to assemble, preserve, translate, and publish papers selected from the literary estate of Albert Einstein and from other collections.</p>

<p>In fall 2008, the freshman class was 42% female, a record for Caltech's undergraduate enrollment. In the same year, the Institute concluded a six-year-long fund-raising campaign. The campaign raised more than $1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors. Nearly half of the funds went into the support of Caltech programs and projects.</p>
<p>In 2010, Caltech, in partnership with <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" title="Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> and headed by Professor <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Lewis" title="Nathan Lewis">Nathan Lewis</a>, established a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">DOE</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy#Energy_Innovation_Hubs" title="United States Department of Energy">Energy Innovation Hub</a> aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight.

<p>Caltech's 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located in <a href="/wiki/Pasadena,_California" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena, California</a>, approximately 11 miles (18 km) northeast of <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles" title="Downtown Los Angeles">downtown Los Angeles</a>.

<p>In 1917 Hale hired architect <a href="/wiki/Bertram_Goodhue" title="Bertram Goodhue">Bertram Goodhue</a> to produce a master plan for the 22 acres (8.9 ha) campus. Goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building, Dabney Hall, and several other structures, in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate, the character of the school, and Hale's educational philosophy. Goodhue's designs for Caltech were also influenced by the traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Architecture_of_the_California_Missions" title="Architecture of the California Missions">Spanish mission architecture</a> of Southern California.</p>
<p>In 1971 a <a href="/wiki/1971_San_Fernando_earthquake" title="1971 San Fernando earthquake">magnitude-6.6 earthquake</a> in <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando,_California" title="San Fernando, California">San Fernando</a> caused some damage to the Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. These were some of the first <a href="/wiki/Reinforced_concrete" title="Reinforced concrete">reinforced concrete</a> buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much <a href="/wiki/Rebar" title="Rebar">reinforcing bar</a> had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large <a href="/wiki/Wrecking_ball" title="Wrecking ball">wrecking ball</a> was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.</p>
<p>New additions to the campus include the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the <a href="/wiki/Walter_Annenberg" title="Walter Annenberg">Walter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leonore_Annenberg" title="Leonore Annenberg">Leonore Annenberg</a> Center for Information Science and Technology, which opened in 2009, and the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering followed in March 2010.

Of particular note, programs that were placed within the top 10% of all size programs in that field based on an average of the R95 and S95 rank order include Aeronautics, Astrophysics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Science and Engineering, Geology, Geophysics, Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Planetary Science, and Social Science (Economics).</p>
<p>In 2013 a paper published in the <a href="/wiki/Quarterly_Journal_of_Economics" title="Quarterly Journal of Economics">Quarterly Journal of Economics</a> ranked Caltech 2nd in the U.S. (after <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a>) for revealed preference. The sample of the study was 3240 high achieving students (students ranked in the top 10% of public high school class or top 20% of private high school class). Rankings were based on number of students who accepted offered admission.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Admissions">Admissions</span></h3>
<p>For the Class of 2019 (enrolled fall 2015), Caltech received 6,506 applications and accepted 573 (8.8%); 241 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) of 42.1%. The middle 50% range of <a href="/wiki/SAT" title="SAT">SAT</a> scores for enrolled freshmen were 730-800 for critical reading, 770-800 for math, and 730-790 for writing. The middle 50% range <a href="/wiki/ACT_(test)" title="ACT (test)">ACT</a> Composite score was 34-35.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tuition_and_financial_aid">Tuition and financial aid</span></h3>
<p>Undergraduate tuition for the 2013–2014 school year was $39,990 and total annual costs were estimated to be $58,755. In 2012–2013, Caltech awarded $17.1 million in need-based aid, $438k in non-need-based aid, and $2.51 million in self-help support to enrolled undergraduate student. The average financial aid package of all students eligible for aid was $38,756 and students graduated with an average debt of $15,090.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Undergraduate_program">Undergraduate program</span></h3>
<p>The full-time, four-year undergraduate program emphasizes instruction in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence. Caltech offers 24 majors (called "options") and six minors across all six academic divisions. Caltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in Applied Physics, Biochemistry, Bioengineering, Computation and Neural Systems, Control and Dynamical Systems, Environmental Science and Engineering, Geobiology and Astrobiology, Geochemistry, and Planetary Astronomy. The most popular options are Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Physics.</p>
<p>Prior to the entering class of 2017, Caltech requires students to take a core curriculum of three terms of mathematics, three terms of physics, two terms of chemistry, one term of biology, two terms of lab courses, one terms of scientific communication, three terms of physical education, and 12 terms of humanities and social science.</p>

<p>A typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) in order to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered a heavy load, and registrations above 54 units require an overload petition. Approximately 20 percent of students double-major. This is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major. Although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged, it is still possible.</p>
<p>First-year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math, physics, chemistry, and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a Pass/Fail basis. There is little competition; collaboration on <a href="/wiki/Homework" title="Homework">homework</a> is encouraged and the Honor System encourages take-home tests and flexible homework schedules. Caltech offers co-operative programs with other schools, such as the Pasadena <a href="/wiki/Art_Center_College_of_Design" title="Art Center College of Design">Art Center College of Design</a> and <a href="/wiki/Occidental_College" title="Occidental College">Occidental College</a>.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Caltech alumni have one of the highest median starting salary among graduates of other colleges or universities in 2012–2013, of $67,400, according to <a href="/wiki/PayScale" title="PayScale">PayScale</a>. The mid-career median pay is $120,700. Caltech was found to offer the second highest return of investment of college education, at $1,991,000 over a 30-year period, according to the same study.</p>
<p>Caltech offers Army and Air Force <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ROTC" title="ROTC">ROTC</a> in cooperation with the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Graduate_program">Graduate program</span></h3>

<p>The graduate instructional programs emphasize doctoral studies and are dominated by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The Institute offers graduate degree programs for the Master of Science, Engineer's Degree, Doctor of Philosophy, BS/MS and MD/PhD, with the majority of students in the PhD program. The most popular options are Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. Applicants for graduate studies are required to take the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examination" title="Graduate Record Examination">GRE</a>. GRE Subject scores are either required or strongly recommended by several options. A joint program between Caltech and the <a href="/wiki/Keck_School_of_Medicine_of_USC" title="Keck School of Medicine of USC">Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UCLA_David_Geffen_School_of_Medicine" title="UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine">UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine</a> grants MD/PhD degrees. Students in this program do their preclinical and clinical work at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">USC</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UCLA" title="UCLA">UCLA</a>, and their PhD work with any member of the Caltech faculty, including the Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering and Applied Sciences Divisions. The MD degree would be from USC or UCLA and the PhD would be awarded from Caltech.</p>
<p>The research facilities at Caltech are available to graduate students, but there are opportunities for students to work in facilities of other universities, research centers as well as private industries. The graduate student to faculty ratio is 4:1.</p>
<p>Approximately 99 percent of doctoral students have full financial support. Financial support for graduate students comes in the form of fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships or a combination of fellowship and assistantship support.</p>
<p>Graduate students are bound by the Honor Code, as are the undergraduates, and the Graduate Honor Council oversees any violations of the code.</p>

<p>On Ditch Day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a "stack" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.</p>
<p>Another long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's "<a href="/wiki/Ride_of_the_Valkyries" title="Ride of the Valkyries">Ride of the Valkyries</a>" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pranks">Pranks</span></h4>

<p>Caltech students have been known for the many <a href="/wiki/Student_prank" title="Student prank">pranks</a> (also known as "RFs").</p>
<p>The two most famous in recent history are the changing of the <a href="/wiki/Hollywood_Sign" title="Hollywood Sign">Hollywood Sign</a> to read "Caltech", by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the <a href="/wiki/1984_Rose_Bowl" title="1984 Rose Bowl">1984 Rose Bowl Game</a>. But the most famous of all occurred during the <a href="/wiki/1961_Rose_Bowl" title="1961 Rose Bowl">1961 Rose Bowl Game</a>, where Caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display "Caltech", and several other "unintended" messages. This event is now referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Great_Rose_Bowl_Hoax" title="Great Rose Bowl Hoax">Great Rose Bowl Hoax</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant VP for Student Affairs and Campus Life. "The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's what we are trying to bring back," reported the <i>Boston Globe</i>.</p>
<p>In December 2011, Caltech students went to New York and pulled a prank on Manhattan's <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>. The prank involved making <a href="/wiki/Alamo_(sculpture)" title="Alamo (sculpture)">The Cube</a> sculpture look like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aperture_Science" title="Aperture Science">Aperture Science</a> Weighted Companion Cube from the video game <i><a href="/wiki/Portal_(video_game)" title="Portal (video game)">Portal</a></i>.</p>
<p>Caltech pranks have been documented in three Legends of Caltech books, the most recent of which was edited by alumni Autumn Looijen '99 and Mason A. Porter '98 and published in May 2007.</p>

<p>In 2005, a group of Caltech students pulled a string of pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students. These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read "That Other Institute of Technology". A group of <a href="/wiki/Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT hackers</a> responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read "The Only Institute of Technology." Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and "... because not everyone can go to Caltech" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.</p>
<p>MIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe &amp; Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby <a href="/wiki/Harvey_Mudd_College" title="Harvey Mudd College">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.</p>
<p>On April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from <i>The California Tech</i>, Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of <i>The Tech</i>, MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included "MIT Invents the Interweb", "Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'", and "Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite".</p>
<p>In December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A "sold" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a "Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the "curriculum change."</p>
<p>In September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a <a href="/wiki/TARDIS" title="TARDIS">TARDIS</a>, the time machine from the BBC's <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>, onto a roof. Caught in midact, the prank was aborted. In January 2011, Caltech students in conjunction with MIT students helped put the TARDIS on top of Baxter. Caltech students then moved the TARDIS to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UC_Berkeley" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stanford" title="Stanford">Stanford</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2014, during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend, a group of Caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the MIT logo on the front and the words "The Institute of Technology" on the back. When heated, the mugs turn orange, display a palm tree, and read "Caltech The Hotter Institute of Technology." Identical mugs continue to be sold at the Caltech campus store.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Honor_code">Honor code</span></h4>
<p>Life in the Caltech community is governed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Honor_code" title="Honor code">honor code</a>, which simply states: "No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community." This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students, and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Honor Council.</p>
<p>The honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.</p>
<p>Through the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Though both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.</p>

<p>Other alumni have turned their gaze to the universe. <a href="/wiki/C._Gordon_Fullerton" title="C. Gordon Fullerton">C. Gordon Fullerton</a> (BS 1957, MS 1958) piloted the third <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_shuttle" title="Space shuttle">space shuttle</a> mission and orbited the earth in <a href="/wiki/Skylab" title="Skylab">Skylab</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Arnold_Orville_Beckman" title="Arnold Orville Beckman">Arnold Beckman</a> (PhD 1928) invented the <a href="/wiki/PH_meter" title="PH meter">pH meter</a> and commercialized it with the founding of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beckman_Instruments" title="Beckman Instruments">Beckman Instruments</a>. His success with that company enabled him to provide seed funding for <a href="/wiki/William_Shockley" title="William Shockley">William Shockley</a> (BS 1932), who had co-invented <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> <a href="/wiki/Transistor" title="Transistor">transistors</a> and wanted to commercialize them. Shockley became the founding Director of the <a href="/wiki/Shockley_Semiconductor_Laboratory" title="Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory">Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory</a> division of Beckman Instruments. Shockley had previously worked at <a href="/wiki/Bell_Labs" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs</a>, whose first president was another alumnus, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frank_Jewett" title="Frank Jewett">Frank Jewett</a> (BS 1898). Because his aging mother lived in <a href="/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California" title="Palo Alto, California">Palo Alto, California</a>, Shockley established his laboratory near her in <a href="/wiki/Mountain_View,_California" title="Mountain View, California">Mountain View, California</a>. Shockley was a co-recipient of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_physics" title="Nobel Prize in physics">Nobel Prize in physics</a> in 1956, but his aggressive management style and odd personality at the Shockley Lab became unbearable. In late 1957, eight of his researchers resigned and with support from <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Fairchild" title="Sherman Fairchild">Sherman Fairchild</a> formed <a href="/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor" title="Fairchild Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a>.

Moore</a> (PhD 1954), who later left Fairchild to co-found <a href="/wiki/Intel" title="Intel">Intel</a>. Other offspring companies of Fairchild Semiconductor include <a href="/wiki/National_Semiconductor" title="National Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices" title="Advanced Micro Devices">Advanced Micro Devices</a>, which in turn spawned more technology companies in the area. Shockley's decision to use <a href="/wiki/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a> – instead of <a href="/wiki/Germanium" title="Germanium">germanium</a> – as the <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> material, coupled with the abundance of silicon semiconductor related companies in the area, gave rise to the term "<a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>" to describe that geographic region surrounding Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Caltech alumni also held public offices, with <a href="/wiki/Mustafa_A.G._Abushagur" title="Mustafa A.G. Abushagur">Mustafa A.G.

<p>Caltech has appeared in many works of popular culture, both as itself and in disguised form. <a href="/wiki/MIT_in_popular_culture" title="MIT in popular culture">As with MIT</a>, a Caltech reference is often used to establish a character's high level of intelligence or a technical background; for example, in the novel <i><a href="/wiki/Contact_(novel)" title="Contact (novel)">Contact</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Sagan" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, Eleanor Arroway holds a Ph.D. in <a href="/wiki/Radio_astronomy" title="Radio astronomy">radio astronomy</a> from there. On television, a number of the key characters in the sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory" title="The Big Bang Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a>,</i> including the four leading males and several of the females, are employed at the Institute. Caltech is also the inspiration, and frequent film location, in Stitchers and for the California Institute of Science of <i><a href="/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)" title="Numbers (TV series)">Numb3rs</a></i>. On film, the Pacific Tech of <i><a href="/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1953_film)" title="The War of the Worlds (1953 film)">The War of the Worlds</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Real_Genius" title="Real Genius">Real Genius</a></i> is based on Caltech. In nonfiction, two 2007 documentaries examine aspects of Caltech: <i>Curious</i>, its researchers, and <i>Quantum Hoops</i>, its men's basketball team.</p>
<p>Given its Los Angeles-area location, the grounds of the Institute are often host to short scenes in movies and television. The <a href="/wiki/Athenaeum_at_Caltech" title="Athenaeum at Caltech">Athenaeum dining club</a> appears in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop_(film_series)" title="Beverly Hills Cop (film series)"><i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> series</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_X-Files_(film)" title="The X-Files (film)">The X-Files</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/True_Romance" title="True Romance">True Romance</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_West_Wing" title="The West Wing">The West Wing</a></i>.</p>
