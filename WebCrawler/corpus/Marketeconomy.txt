<p>A <b>market economy</b> is an <a href="/wiki/Economy" title="Economy">economy</a> in which decisions regarding <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Production_(economics)" title="Production (economics)">production</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Distribution_(economics)" title="Distribution (economics)">distribution</a> are based on market determined <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a>, and prices of <a href="/wiki/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a> and <a href="/wiki/Service_(economics)" title="Service (economics)">services</a> are determined in a <a href="/wiki/Free_price_system" title="Free price system">free price system</a>. The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions and the allocation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Producer_good" title="Producer good">producer goods</a> are mainly made by cooperative negotiation through markets. This is contrasted with a <a href="/wiki/Planned_economy" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>, where investment and production decisions are embodied in a plan of production established by a <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> or other body with control over economic resources.</p>
<p>Market economies can range from <a href="/wiki/Regulated_market" title="Regulated market">regulated markets</a> to various forms of state-owned <a href="/wiki/Economic_interventionism" title="Economic interventionism">interventionist</a> variants. In reality, market economies and <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free markets</a> do not exist in pure form, since societies and governments all regulate them to varying degrees. Different perspectives exist as to how strong a role the government should have in both guiding and regulating the market economies and addressing (or not addressing) the inequalities the market naturally produces since some producers are always better than others. Most existing market economies include a degree of state <a href="/wiki/Economic_planning" title="Economic planning">economic planning</a> or state-directed activity, and are thus classified as <a href="/wiki/Mixed_economy" title="Mixed economy">mixed economies</a>. The term <i><a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free-market</a> economy</i> is sometimes used synonymously with market economy.</p>
<p>Market economies do not logically presuppose the existence of <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private ownership</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>. A market economy can and often does consist of a mix of various types of cooperatives, collectives, or autonomous state agencies that acquire and exchange capital goods in capital markets. These all utilize a market determined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor. There are many variations of <a href="/wiki/Market_socialism" title="Market socialism">market socialism</a>, some of which involve <a href="/wiki/Worker_cooperative" title="Worker cooperative">employee-owned enterprises</a> based on <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">self-management</a>; as well as models that involve public ownership of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> where capital goods are allocated through markets.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a></div>

<p>Capitalism generally refers to an economic system where the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> are largely or entirely <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">privately owned and operated</a> for a profit, structured on the process of <a href="/wiki/Capital_accumulation" title="Capital accumulation">capital accumulation</a>. In general, in capitalist systems investment, distribution, income, and prices are determined by markets, whether regulated or unregulated.</p>
<p>There are different variations of capitalism with different relationships to markets. In <a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">Laissez-faire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> variations of capitalism, markets are utilized most extensively with minimal or no state intervention and regulation over prices and the supply of goods and services. In <a href="/wiki/Economic_interventionism" title="Economic interventionism">interventionist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Welfare_capitalism" title="Welfare capitalism">welfare capitalism</a> and mixed economies, markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct <a href="/wiki/Market_failure" title="Market failure">market failures</a> or to promote social welfare. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/State_capitalist" title="State capitalist">state capitalist</a> systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on either <a href="/wiki/Indicative_planning" title="Indicative planning">indirect economic planning</a> and/or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/State_enterprise" title="State enterprise">state-owned enterprises</a> to accumulate capital.</p>
<p>Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a>, but most feel that the term "mixed economies" more precisely describes most contemporary economies, due to their containing both private-owned and state-owned enterprises. In capitalism, prices determine the demand-supply scale. For example, higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices.</p>

<p>Free-market economy refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets, private ownership of productive enterprises. <i>Laissez-faire</i> is a more extensive form of free-market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting <a href="/wiki/Property_rights_(economics)" title="Property rights (economics)">property rights</a>.</p>

<p>Welfare capitalism refers to a capitalist economy that includes public policies favoring extensive provisions for social welfare services. The economic mechanism involves a free market and the predominance of privately owned enterprises in the economy, but public provision of universal welfare services aimed at enhancing individual autonomy and maximizing equality.

<p>The East Asian model of capitalism involves a strong role for state investment, and in some instances involves state-owned enterprises. The state takes an active role in promoting economic development through subsidies, the facilitation of "national champions", and an export-based model of growth. The actual practice of this model varies by country. This designation has been applied to the economies of Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the People's Republic of China.</p>

The social market economic model (sometimes called "Rhine capitalism") is based upon the idea of realizing the benefits of a free market economy, especially economic performance and high supply of goods, while avoiding disadvantages such as <a href="/wiki/Market_failure" title="Market failure">market failure</a>, destructive competition, concentration of economic power and the anti-social effects of market processes. The aim of the social market economy is to realize greatest prosperity combined with best possible social security. One difference from the free market economy is that the state is not passive, but takes active <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulatory</a> measures. The social policy objectives include employment, housing and education policies, as well as a socio-politically motivated balancing of the distribution of income growth.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Market_socialism">Market socialism</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Market_socialism" title="Market socialism">Market socialism</a></div>

<p>Market socialism refers to various types of economic systems where the means of production and the dominant economic institutions are either <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_ownership" title="Public ownership">publicly owned</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cooperative" title="Cooperative">cooperatively owned</a> but operated according to the rules of supply and demand. This type of market economy has its roots in <a href="/wiki/Classical_economics" title="Classical economics">classical economics</a> and in the works of <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ricardian_socialism" title="Ricardian socialism">Ricardian socialists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory)" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">Mutualist</a> philosophers.</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature between non-market socialism and market socialism is the existence of a market for <a href="/wiki/Factors_of_production" title="Factors of production">factors of production</a> and the criteria of profitability for enterprises. Profits derived from publicly owned enterprises can variously be used to reinvest in further production, to directly finance government and social services, or be distributed to the public at large through a <a href="/wiki/Social_dividend" title="Social dividend">social dividend</a> or <a href="/wiki/Basic_income" title="Basic income">basic income</a> system.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_ownership_models">Public ownership models</span></h3>
<p>In the 1930s, the economists <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oskar_Lange" title="Oskar Lange">Oskar Lange</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abba_Lerner" title="Abba Lerner">Abba Lerner</a> developed a model of socialism that posited that a public body (dubbed the "Central Planning Board") can set prices through a trial-and-error approach until they equaled the <a href="/wiki/Marginal_cost" title="Marginal cost">marginal cost</a> of production in order to achieve <a href="/wiki/Perfect_competition" title="Perfect competition">perfect competition</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pareto_optimality" title="Pareto optimality">pareto optimality</a>. In this model of socialism, firms would be state-owned and managed by their employees, and the profits would be disbursed among the population in a social dividend. This model came to be referred to as "market socialism" because it involved the use of money, a <a href="/wiki/Price_system" title="Price system">price system</a> and simulated capital markets, all of which are absent from traditional non-market conceptions of socialism.</p>
<p>A more contemporary model of market socialism is that put forth by the American economist <a href="/wiki/John_Roemer" title="John Roemer">John Roemer</a>, referred to as <i><a href="/wiki/Economic_democracy" title="Economic democracy">Economic democracy</a></i>. In this model, <a href="/wiki/Social_ownership" title="Social ownership">social ownership</a> is achieved through public ownership of equity in a market economy. A Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO) would own controlling shares in publicly listed firms, so that the profits generated would be used for public finance and the provision of a basic income.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooperative_socialism">Cooperative socialism</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Libertarian_socialism" title="Libertarian socialism">Libertarian socialists</a> and left-anarchists often promote a form of market socialism in which enterprises are owned and managed cooperatively by their workforce so that the profits directly remunerate the employee-owners. These cooperative enterprises would compete with each other in the same way private companies compete with each other in a capitalist market. The first major elaboration of this type of market socialism was made by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon" title="Pierre Joseph Proudhon">Pierre Joseph Proudhon</a> and was called "<a href="/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory)" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualism</a>".</p>
<p>Self-managed market socialism was promoted in Yugoslavia by economists <a href="/wiki/Branko_Horvat" title="Branko Horvat">Branko Horvat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jaroslav_Vanek" title="Jaroslav Vanek">Jaroslav Vanek</a>. In the self-managed model of socialism, firms would be directly owned by their employees and the management board would be elected by employees. These cooperative firms would compete with each other in a market for both capital goods and for selling consumer goods.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Socialist_market_economy">Socialist market economy</span></h3>
<p>Following the 1978 reforms, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> instituted what it calls a "<a href="/wiki/Socialist_market_economy" title="Socialist market economy">socialist market economy</a>", in which most of the economy is under state ownership, but the state enterprises are organized as joint-stock companies where various government agencies own controlling shares through a shareholder system. Prices are set by a largely free-price system and the state-owned enterprises are not subjected to micromanagement by a government planning agency. A similar system called "<a href="/wiki/Socialist-oriented_market_economy" title="Socialist-oriented market economy">socialist-oriented market economy</a>" has emerged in <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%95i_M%E1%BB%9Bi" title="Đổi Mới">Đổi Mới</a> reforms in 1986.</p>
<p>However, this system is usually characterized as <a href="/wiki/State_capitalism" title="State capitalism">state capitalism</a> instead of market socialism because there is no meaningful degree of employee self-management in firms, because the state enterprises retain their profits instead of distributing them to the workforce or government, and many function as de facto private enterprises. The profits neither finance a social dividend to benefit the population at large, nor do they accrue to their employees.</p>
<p>In the People's Republic of China, this economic model is presented as a "<a href="/wiki/Primary_stage_of_socialism" title="Primary stage of socialism">preliminary stage of socialism</a>" to explain the dominance of capitalistic management practices and forms of enterprise organization in both the state and non-state sectors.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticisms">Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>The economist <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz" title="Joseph Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a> argues that markets suffer from informational inefficiency and the presumed efficiency of markets stems from the faulty assumptions of <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_economics" title="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical</a> welfare economics, particularly the assumption of perfect and costless information, and related incentive problems. Neoclassical economics assumes static equilibrium, and efficient markets require that there be no non-<a href="/wiki/Convexity_(finance)" title="Convexity (finance)">convexities</a>, even though nonconvexities are pervasive in modern economies. Stiglitz's critique applies to both existing models of capitalism and to hypothetical models of market socialism. However, Stiglitz does not advocate replacing markets, but states that there is a significant role for <a href="/wiki/Economic_interventionism" title="Economic interventionism">government intervention</a> to boost the efficiency of markets and to address the pervasive market failures that exist in contemporary economies.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Robin_Hahnel" title="Robin Hahnel">Robin Hahnel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Albert" title="Michael Albert">Michael Albert</a> claim that "markets inherently produce class division." Albert states that even if everyone started out with a <a href="/wiki/Balanced_job_complex" title="Balanced job complex">balanced job complex</a> (doing a mix of roles of varying creativity, responsibility and empowerment) in a market economy, class divisions would arise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without taking the argument that far, it is evident that in a market system with uneven distribution of empowering work, such as Economic Democracy, some workers will be more able than others to capture the benefits of economic gain. For example, if one worker designs cars and another builds them, the designer will use his cognitive skills more frequently than the builder. In the long term, the designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder, giving the former greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of income. A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten to work for a company that will pay him more. The effect is a class division between conceptual and manual laborers, and ultimately managers and workers, and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/David_McNally_(professor)" title="David McNally (professor)">David McNally</a> argues that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free markets he championed. The development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Adam Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of "fair" markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging "parasitical" elements from the market economy, such as private ownership of the means of production. McNally argues that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wage_labor" title="Wage labor">wage-based labor</a>.</p>
