For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials. For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product.</p>
<p>Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Product_lifecycle_(marketing)" title="Product lifecycle (marketing)">product lifecycle</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comprehensive_outcome" title="Comprehensive outcome">comprehensive outcome</a> of the whole production process. It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict <a href="/wiki/Service_economy" title="Service economy">service economy</a> interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.</p>
<p>The most familiar example is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Container-deposit_legislation" title="Container-deposit legislation">container-deposit legislation</a>. A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains. If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or <a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a>. If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for <a href="/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfill</a> or <a href="/wiki/Litter" title="Litter">litter</a> control measures. Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving. This is quite common for instance among <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Homeless" title="Homeless">homeless</a> people in <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a> cities.</p>
<p>However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to <a href="/wiki/Paint" title="Paint">paint</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobile</a> parts such as <a href="/wiki/Tire" title="Tire">tires</a>. When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the <a href="/wiki/Toxic_waste" title="Toxic waste">toxic waste</a> they become. In some countries, such as <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> requires attention to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comprehensive_outcome" title="Comprehensive outcome">comprehensive outcome</a> of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way. This is also the trend in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a> generally. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the issue has been confronted via <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_action_suit" title="Class action suit">class action lawsuits</a> that attempt to hold companies <a href="/wiki/Legal_liability" title="Legal liability">liable</a> for the environmental impact of their products. Thus far, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Litigation" title="Litigation">litigation</a> or proposed <a href="/wiki/Accounting_reform" title="Accounting reform">accounting reforms</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Full_cost_accounting" title="Full cost accounting">full cost accounting</a> have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Academe" title="Academe">academe</a> and corporate <a href="/wiki/Public_relations" title="Public relations">public relations</a> (derisively referred to as <a href="/wiki/Greenwashing" title="Greenwashing">greenwashing</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Demand" title="Demand">demand-side</a> approach <a href="/wiki/Ethical_consumerism" title="Ethical consumerism">ethical consumerism</a>, supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship.</p>

<p>Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with <a href="/wiki/Extended_producer_responsibility" title="Extended producer responsibility">Extended producer responsibility</a>, a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used.</p>
<p>While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product. This includes not only the manufacturers, but also the retailers, consumers and recyclers as well.</p>
