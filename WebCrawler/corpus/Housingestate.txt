<p>A <b>housing estate</b> is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country. Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance.</p>
<p>In Asian cities such as <a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shenzhen" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, an estate may range from detached houses to high density <a href="/wiki/Tower_block" title="Tower block">tower blocks</a> with or without commercial facilities; in Europe and America, these may take the form of town housing, or the older-style rows of <a href="/wiki/Terraced_house" title="Terraced house">terraced houses</a> associated with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a>, detached or <a href="/wiki/Semi-detached" title="Semi-detached">semi-detached</a> <a href="/wiki/House" title="House">houses</a> with small plots of land around them forming gardens, and are frequently without commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Housing estates are the usual form of residential design used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_town" title="New town">new towns</a>, where estates are designed as an autonomous suburb, centred on a small commercial centre. Such estates are usually designed to minimise through-traffic flows, and to provide recreational space in the form of parks and greens.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The use of the term may have arisen from an area of housing being built on what had been a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Estate_(house)" title="Estate (house)">country estate</a> as towns and cities expanded in and after the 19th century. It was in use by 1901. Reduction of the phrase to mere "estate" is common in the United Kingdom and <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> (especially when preceded by the specific estate name), but not in the United States.</p>

Gated communities in Pakistan are targeted towards upper middle class and upper class, and are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, housing estates have become prevalent since <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, as a more affluent population demanded larger and more widely spaced houses coupled with the increase of car usage for which <a href="/wiki/Terraced_house" title="Terraced house">terraced</a> streets were unsuitable.</p>
<p>Housing estates were produced by either local corporations or by private developers. The former tended to be a means of producing <a href="/wiki/Public_housing" title="Public housing">public housing</a> leading to <a href="/wiki/Monotenure" title="Monotenure">monotenure</a> estates full of <a href="/wiki/Council_house" title="Council house">council houses</a> often known as "council estates". The latter can refer to higher end <a href="/wiki/Tract_housing" title="Tract housing">tract housing</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Middle_class" title="Middle class">middle class</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Upper_middle_class" title="Upper middle class">upper middle class</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the problems incurred by the early attempts at high density tower-block housing turned people away from this style of living. The resulting demand for land has seen many towns and cities increase enormously in size for only moderate increases in population. This has been largely at the expense of rural and <a href="/wiki/Greenfield_land" title="Greenfield land">greenfield land</a>. Recently, there has been some effort to address this problem by banning the development of out-of-town commercial developments, and encouraging the reuse of <a href="/wiki/Brownfield_land" title="Brownfield land">brownfield</a> or previously developed sites for residential building. Nevertheless, the demand for housing continues to rise, and in the UK at least has precipitated a significant housing crisis.</p>
<p>Renowned housing estates in the capital include the <a href="/wiki/Andover_Estate" title="Andover Estate">Andover Estate</a> in Holloway, North London, the aforementioned Broadwater Farm estate situated in <a href="/wiki/Tottenham" title="Tottenham">Tottenham</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Heygate_Estate" title="Heygate Estate">Heygate Estate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Walworth" title="Walworth">Walworth</a>, South East London and the <a href="/wiki/Alton_Estate" title="Alton Estate">Alton Estate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Roehampton" title="Roehampton">Roehampton</a>, South West London.</p>
<p>In the UK, some of the post war <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_town" title="New town">new towns</a> were constructed <i>en masse</i> from housing estates rather than as organic growth from a population centre.</p>

<p>In the former <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slovakia" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>) during the Communist era a construction of large housing estates (Czech: <i>sídliště</i>, Slovak: <i>sídlisko</i>) was an important part of then urban planning. The government wanted to provide large quantities of affordable housing and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a "collectivistic nature" in the people. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings now dominate the suburbs of <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bratislava" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> and other towns. The largest such suburb in the former Czechoslovakia and <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">central Europe</a> can be found in <a href="/wiki/Petr%C5%BEalka" title="Petržalka">Petržalka</a> (population about 130,000), a part of the Slovak capital of Bratislava.</p>

<p>Due to dense population and government control of land use, the most common form of residential housing in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> is the high-rise housing estate, which may be publicly owned, privately owned, or semi-private. Due to the <a href="/wiki/Oligopoly" title="Oligopoly">oligopoly</a> of <a href="/wiki/Real_estate_development" title="Real estate development">real-estate developers</a> in the territory, and the <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private <a href="/wiki/Tower_block" title="Tower block">tower block</a> developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30-to-70-storeys high.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Public_housing_in_Hong_Kong" title="Public housing in Hong Kong">Public housing</a> provides affordable homes for those on low incomes, with rents which are heavily <a href="/wiki/Subsidy" title="Subsidy">subsidised</a>, financed by financial activities such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the estates. They may vary in scale, and are usually located in the remote or less accessible parts of the territory, but urban expansion has put some of them in the heart of the urban area. Although some units are destined exclusively for rental, some of the flats within each development are earmarked for sale at prices which are lower than for private developments.</p>
<p>A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Private_housing_estate" title="Private housing estate">private housing estate</a> is usually characterised by a cluster of high-rise buildings, often with a <a href="/wiki/Shopping_mall" title="Shopping mall">shopping centre</a> or market of its own in the case of larger developments. <a href="/wiki/Mei_Foo_Sun_Chuen" title="Mei Foo Sun Chuen">Mei Foo Sun Chuen</a>, built by <a href="/wiki/Mobil" title="Mobil">Mobil</a>, is the earliest (1965) and largest (99 blocks) example of its kind. Since the mid-1990s, private developers have been incorporating leisure facilities which incorporate clubhouse facilities: namely swimming pools, tennis courts, function rooms in their more up-market developments. The most recent examples would also be equipped with cinemas, dance studios, cigar-rooms.</p>
<p>There is currently some controversy over the "wall effect" caused by uniform high-rise developments which adversely impact air circulation. In-fill developments will tend to be done by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect.</p>
