<p>Ecolabelling systems exist for both food and consumer products. Both systems were started by <a href="/wiki/Non-governmental_organization" title="Non-governmental organization">NGOs</a>, since then the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> have developed <a href="/wiki/Legislation" title="Legislation">legislation</a> for conduct of ecolabelling and also have created their own ecolabels, one for food and one for consumer products. At least for food, the ecolabel is nearly identical with the common NGO definition of the rules for ecolabelling. Label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up "rubber stamp" labels to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenwash" title="Greenwash">greenwash</a> their products with fake ecolabels. High trust levels can be created when ecolabels apply for Governmental recognition as formal Certification Marks [recognized by logos or names with 'CTM', CM or 'CertTM']. Typically this means schemes approved as a Certification Mark, have had the Government Department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are 'Competent to Certify'. The highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key ISO standards especially ISO 14024- Type 1 Ecolabels that undertake ISO 14040 compliant life cycle analysis as part of their assessment.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs. The International Organization for Standardization <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ISO" title="ISO">ISO</a> has created standards for labeling practices within the <a href="/wiki/ISO_14000" title="ISO 14000">ISO 14000</a> schema. <b>ISO 14020 to 14025</b> series deals with environmental labels and declarations. ISO proposed three categories of environmental labels according to the aspects covered and the rigor required to award the seal: type I in ISO 14024; type II in ISO 14021; and type III in ISO 14025. Additionally, a different category called “Type I – like” is present in the literature, which represents environmental labels focused on just one environmental or social aspect; these labels have been launched by independent organizations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecolabeling_innovation_cycle">Ecolabeling innovation cycle</span></h2>
<p>There is a close relationship between the ecolabeling process and the eco-innovation because it promotes the emergence of new green products and it improves the organizations environmental management strategy. Moreover, ecolabeling process is a "cyclical eco-innovation process in which consumers, firms, governments and institutions interact. Its final purpose is to contribute to the development of sustainable and ecological ways of production and consumption. In this process, consumers’ environmental expectations are met; firms increase their created and captured value and enhance their sustainability, and governments and institutions foster cleaner production and consumption. Finally, this process is tangible in the products through the awarding of ecolabels, which are visibly displayed on goods and services".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_governance">Environmental governance</span></h2>
<p>Consumer desires for <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_consumption" title="Sustainable consumption">sustainable consumption</a> is driving the global marketplace with desire to regulate product production. The globalization of economies is shifting control of sustainability away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument, ecolabelling.</p>
<p>The only ecolabel that takes into consideration legal and infrastructural limitations is  which is a startup in Greece approved by the University of Wales and which has the Support of the Dutch Embassy and the Orange Grove. It is a certification programme with the intention to increase owner, staff, suppliers and stakeholder’s awareness with the intention to motivate them for an eco-friendly action towards a sustainable holiday and future for all of us in the long run and through which expenses can be minimized.</p>
<p>Eco-labeling standardization is a new form of regulation which is voluntary in nature, but impose upon large companies market forces in order to harmonize production of goods and services with stronger ecological practices. Recently, it has turned into a new form of non-state authority at both national and international levels. This idea of <b>entrepreneurial democracy</b> based on the success of the ISO 14000 standards on the management of environmental quality and the ISO 9000 standards on quality production control. Once an industry sector decides to get this certification, it has to provide evidences of documented proof of compliance required. In terms of ISO 14042 standard, it is obligatorily for all applicants to respect environmental legislation and related legislation; breaching of any laws may result in licensing suspension.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">UN</a> <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a> Conference in 1992, an international consensus was generated to integrate environmental issues into manufacturing procedures. The idea was to manipulate consumption patterns in order to achieve <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>. The result of this is as follows.</p>
<p><b>Currently in the</b> <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed world</a>: Eco-labels and green stickers have evolved to play a vital role. They provide a verifiable link between products and <a href="/wiki/Informed_consumer" title="Informed consumer">informed consumer</a> wishes. This approach applies market pressure on industries to minimize their environmental impact; this is evidenced by growth in population of <a href="/wiki/Informed_consumer" title="Informed consumer">informed consumers</a>.

<p><b>Currently in the</b> <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing world</a>: First consumers became concerned about the quality, safety and environmental sustainability of food and supported demand for green foods, then focused on the environmental effects of agriculture and globalization of food production, which led to the exposure of globally controlled food regimes. Consumer advocate groups responded with a call for [Alternative Food Networks]. This gives a new dimension to consumer demands and corporate competitiveness. Australian Consumer Association <a href="/wiki/Choice_(Australian_consumer_organisation)" title="Choice (Australian consumer organisation)">CHOICE</a> confronted corporate interests with their concerns about growing interests in green consumption, food production, use of pesticides, organic production, and genetic modification, etc...</p>

<p><b>Green Stickers</b> on consumer goods have been evolving since the 1970s. The main drivers have been energy and fuel consumption. These stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the United States and Canada legislated their requirement. Manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use. The automobile industry in North America is required to meet a minimum emissions standard. This led to fuel efficiency labels being placed on new automobiles sold. The major appliance manufactures were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products. The <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> has developed standards for addressing environmental labelling with the <a href="/wiki/ISO_14000" title="ISO 14000">ISO 14000</a> family which grew out of ISO's commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992</p>
<p>Green Labelling worldwide is moving beyond traditional country borders. Most of these initiatives are voluntary Eco-labels, however there is an initiative under way in North America to broaden the scope of Green Stickers to include other consumer goods.</p>

<p>The Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) run by the Department of Natural Resources Canada regulates both the automobile and appliance manufacturers. EnerGuide label for vehicles found on all new passenger cars, light-duty vans, pickup trucks and special purpose vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 3855 kg (8500 lb). The label shows the city and highway fuel consumption ratings and an estimated annual fuel cost for that particular vehicle. Federal law in Canada, under Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations,requires that the EnerGuide label be placed on all new electrical appliances manufactured in or imported into Canada and that the label indicate the amount of electricity used by that appliance. This information is determined by standardized test procedures. A third-party agency verifies that an appliance meets Canada's minimum energy performance levels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>

<p>All major home appliances must meet the Appliance Standards Program set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) on cooperation with the US Federal Trade Commission. Manufacturers must use standard test procedures developed by DOE to prove the energy use and efficiency of their products. Test results are printed on yellow EnergyGuide label, which manufacturers are required to display on many appliances. This label estimates how much energy the appliance uses, compares energy use of similar products, and lists approximate annual operating costs. Appliances that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are eligible for the blue <a href="/wiki/Energy_Star" title="Energy Star">Energy Star</a> label. The Energy Star label is also available on energy-efficient televisions, computers, audio visual equipment and electronics, office equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and many more products. Energy Star is also available on energy efficient homes and buildings in the United States.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Marine_Stewardship_Council" title="Marine Stewardship Council">Marine Stewardship Council</a> (MSC) is an independent non-profit organisation which sets a standard for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_fishing" title="Sustainable fishing">sustainable fishing</a>. Fisheries that wish to demonstrate they are well managed and sustainable against the <a class="external text" href="http://www.msc.org/about-us/standards/standards" rel="nofollow">MSC standard</a> are assessed by a team of experts who are independent of both the fishery and the MSC. The MSC ecolabel can only be displayed on seafood products that can be traced back to a fishery that has been certified against the MSC standard.</p>
<p>The MSC was founded in 1997 by the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> and <a href="/wiki/Unilever" title="Unilever">Unilever</a>, and became fully independent in 1999.
