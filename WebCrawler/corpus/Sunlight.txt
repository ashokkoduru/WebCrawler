<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
<p>Researchers may record sunlight using a <a href="/wiki/Sunshine_recorder" title="Sunshine recorder">sunshine recorder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pyranometer" title="Pyranometer">pyranometer</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Pyrheliometer" title="Pyrheliometer">pyrheliometer</a>.</p>
<p>Sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth from the surface of the Sun. A photon starting at the centre of the Sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface.</p>
<p>The total amount of energy received at ground level from the Sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the Sun and thus on the time of year. It is about 3.3% higher than average in January and 3.3% lower in July (see below). If the extraterrestrial solar radiation is 1367 watts per square meter (the value when the Earth–Sun distance is 1 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">astronomical unit</a>), then the direct sunlight at Earth's surface when the Sun is at the <a href="/wiki/Zenith" title="Zenith">zenith</a> is about 1050 W/m, but the total amount (direct and indirect from the atmosphere) hitting the ground is around 1120 W/m. In terms of energy, sunlight at Earth's surface is around 52 to 55 percent infrared (above 700 <a href="/wiki/Nanometre" title="Nanometre">nm</a>), 42 to 43 percent visible (400 to 700 nm), and 3 to 5 percent ultraviolet (below 400 nm). At the top of the atmosphere, sunlight is about 30% more intense, having about 8% <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV), with most of the extra UV consisting of biologically damaging short-wave ultraviolet.</p>
<p>Direct sunlight has a <a href="/wiki/Luminous_efficacy" title="Luminous efficacy">luminous efficacy</a> of about 93 <a href="/wiki/Lumen_(unit)" title="Lumen (unit)">lumens</a> per watt of <a href="/wiki/Radiant_flux" title="Radiant flux">radiant flux</a>. This is higher than the efficacy (of source) of most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Artificial_lighting" title="Artificial lighting">artificial lighting</a> (including fluorescent), which means using sunlight for illumination heats up a room less than using most forms of artificial lighting.</p>
<p>Multiplying the figure of 1050 watts per square metre by 93 lumens per watt indicates that bright sunlight provides an <a href="/wiki/Illuminance" title="Illuminance">illuminance</a> of approximately 98 000 <a href="/wiki/Lux" title="Lux">lux</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lumen_(unit)" title="Lumen (unit)">lumens</a> per square meter) on a perpendicular surface at sea level. The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky. Averaged over a day, the highest amount of sunlight on a horizontal surface occurs in January at the <a href="/wiki/South_Pole" title="South Pole">South Pole</a> (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insolation" title="Insolation">insolation</a>).</p>
<p>Dividing the <a href="/wiki/Irradiance" title="Irradiance">irradiance</a> of 1050 W/m by the size of the sun's disk in <a href="/wiki/Steradian" title="Steradian">steradians</a> gives an average <a href="/wiki/Radiance" title="Radiance">radiance</a> of 15.4 MW per square metre per steradian. (However, the radiance at the centre of the sun's disk is somewhat higher than the average over the whole disk due to <a href="/wiki/Limb_darkening" title="Limb darkening">limb darkening</a>.) Multiplying this by π gives an upper limit to the irradiance which can be focused on a surface using mirrors: 48.5 MW/m.</p>
<p>Sunlight is a key factor in <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, the process used by plants and other <a href="/wiki/Autotroph" title="Autotroph">autotrophic</a> organisms to convert <a href="/wiki/Light" title="Light">light</a> energy, normally from the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>, into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organisms' activities.</p>

Although the Sun produces <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">Gamma rays</a> as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" title="Nuclear fusion">nuclear fusion</a> process, these super-high-energy <a href="/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> are converted by internal absorption and thermalization to lower-energy photons before they reach the Sun's surface and are emitted out into space. As a result, the Sun does not emit gamma rays from this process, but it does emit gamma rays from solar flares.

<p>Although the solar <a href="/wiki/Corona" title="Corona">corona</a> is a source of <a href="/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet" title="Extreme ultraviolet">extreme ultraviolet</a> and X-ray radiation, these rays make up only a very small amount of the power output of the Sun (see spectrum at right). The spectrum of nearly all solar <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> striking the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="Atmosphere of Earth">Earth's atmosphere</a> spans a range of 100 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanometer" title="Nanometer">nm</a> to about 1 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Millimeter" title="Millimeter">mm</a> (1,000,000 nm). This band of significant radiation power can be divided into five regions in increasing order of <a href="/wiki/Wavelength" title="Wavelength">wavelengths</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ultraviolet C</b> or (UVC) range, which spans a range of 100 to 280 nm.

<li><b>Ultraviolet B</b> or (UVB) range spans 280 to 315 nm.

<li><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Visible_light" title="Visible light">Visible</a> range</b> or <b>light</b> spans 380 to 780 nm. As the name suggests, it is this range that is visible to the naked eye. It is also the strongest output range of the Sun's total irradiance spectrum.</li>

<ul>
<li>Infrared-A: 700 nm to 1,400 nm</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculation">Calculation</span></h2>
<p>To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit" title="Earth's orbit">Earth's elliptical orbit</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_extinction" title="Atmospheric extinction">attenuation by Earth's atmosphere</a> have to be taken into account.

<p>where dn=1 on January 1st; dn=32 on February 1st; dn=59 on March 1 (except on leap years, where dn=60), etc. In this formula dn–3 is used, because in modern times <a href="/wiki/Apsis#Earth.27s_perihelion_and_aphelion" title="Apsis">Earth's perihelion</a>, the closest approach to the Sun and, therefore, the maximum <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><sub>ext</sub></span> occurs around January 3 each year. The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989 AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033 AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.</p>
<p>The solar illuminance constant (<span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><sub>sc</sub></span>), is equal to 128×10 <a href="/wiki/Lux" title="Lux">lx</a>.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Solar_constant" title="Solar constant">Solar constant</a></div>

<p>The <b>solar constant</b>, a measure of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flux_density" title="Flux density">flux density</a>, is the amount of incoming solar <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> per unit area that would be incident on a plane perpendicular to the rays, at a distance of one <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">astronomical unit (AU)</a> (roughly the mean distance from the Sun to Earth). The "solar constant" includes all types of solar radiation, not just the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Visible_light" title="Visible light">visible light</a>. Its average value was thought to be approximately 1.366 kW/m², varying slightly with <a href="/wiki/Solar_cycle" title="Solar cycle">solar activity</a>, but recent recalibrations of the relevant satellite observations indicate a value closer to 1.361 kW/m² is more realistic.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Total_.28TSI.29_and_spectral_solar_irradiance_.28SSI.29_upon_Earth">Total (TSI) and spectral solar irradiance (SSI) upon Earth</span></h2>
<p><span id="Total_Solar_Irradiance"></span><span id="TSI"></span> <b>Total solar irradiance</b> (TSI) – the amount of solar radiation received at the top of Earth's atmosphere – has been measured since 1978 by a series of overlapping NASA and ESA satellite experiments to be 1.361 <a href="/wiki/Kilo-" title="Kilo-">kilo</a>⁠watts per square meter (kW/m²). TSI observations are continuing today with the <a href="/wiki/ACRIMSAT" title="ACRIMSAT">ACRIMSAT</a>/ACRIM3, <a href="/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory" title="Solar and Heliospheric Observatory">SOHO</a>/VIRGO and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SORCE" title="SORCE">SORCE</a>/TIM satellite experiments. Variation of TSI has been discovered on many timescales including the solar magnetic cycle  and many shorter periodic cycles. TSI provides the energy that drives Earth's climate, so continuation of the TSI time series database is critical to understanding the role of solar variability in climate change.</p>
<p><b>Spectral solar irradiance</b> (SSI) – the spectral distribution of the TSI – has been monitored since 2003 by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SORCE" title="SORCE">SORCE</a> <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Spectral_Irradiance_Monitor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Spectral Irradiance Monitor (page does not exist)">Spectral Irradiance Monitor</a> (SIM). It has been found that SSI at UV (ultraviolet) wavelength corresponds in a less clear, and probably more complicated fashion, with Earth's climate responses than earlier assumed, fueling broad avenues of new research in “the connection of the Sun and stratosphere, troposphere, biosphere, ocean, and Earth’s climate”.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Intensity_in_the_Solar_System">Intensity in the Solar System</span></h2>

<p>Different bodies of the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> receive light of an intensity inversely proportional to the square of their distance from Sun. A rough table comparing the amount of solar radiation received by each planet in the Solar System follows (from data in <a class="external autonumber" href="http://starhop.com/library/pdf/studyguide/high/SolInt-19.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>):</p>

<p>The actual brightness of sunlight that would be observed at the surface depends also on the presence and composition of an <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. For example, <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus" title="Atmosphere of Venus">Venus's thick atmosphere</a> reflects more than 60% of the solar light it receives. The actual illumination of the surface is about 14,000 lux, comparable to that on Earth "in the daytime with overcast clouds".</p>
<p>Sunlight on Mars would be more or less like daylight on Earth during a slightly overcast day, and, as can be seen in the pictures taken by the rovers, there is enough diffuse sky radiation that shadows would not seem particularly dark. Thus, it would give perceptions and "feel" very much like Earth daylight. The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth, due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see <a href="/wiki/Daylight" title="Daylight">daylight</a> for comparison table). Even on Pluto the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full <a href="/wiki/Moonlight" title="Moonlight">moonlight</a> on Earth, a distance of about 500 AU (~69 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light-hour" title="Light-hour">light-hours</a>) is needed; there are only a handful of objects in the Solar System known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them <a href="/wiki/90377_Sedna" title="90377 Sedna">90377 Sedna</a> and <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/(87269)_2000_OO67" title="(87269) 2000 OO67">(87269) 2000 OO<span style="position: relative; top: 0.3em;"><span style="font-size:80%;">67</span></span></a></span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Surface_illumination">Surface illumination</span></h2>
<p>The spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light <a href="/wiki/Photography" title="Photography">photography</a> where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.</p>
<p>While the color of the sky is usually determined by <a href="/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" title="Rayleigh scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>, an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. "Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon".</p>
<p>See <a href="/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation" title="Diffuse sky radiation">diffuse sky radiation</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spectral_composition_of_sunlight_at_Earth.27s_surface">Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface</span></h3>
<p>The Sun's electromagnetic radiation which is received at the Earth's surface is predominantly light that falls within the range of wavelengths to which the visual systems of the animals that inhabit Earth's surface are sensitive. The Sun may therefore be said to <a href="/wiki/Lighting" title="Lighting">illuminate</a>, which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range. Many animals (including humans) have a sensitivity range of approximately 400–700 nm, and given optimal conditions the absorption and scattering by Earth's atmosphere produces illumination that approximates an <a href="/wiki/Standard_illuminant" title="Standard illuminant">equal-energy illuminant</a> for most of this range. The useful range for color vision in humans, for example, is approximately 450–650 nm. Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise, the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate. When illumination is indirect, <a href="/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" title="Rayleigh scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a> in the upper atmosphere will lead blue wavelengths to dominate. Water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone, dust and water particles will also absorb selective wavelengths.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Heterotroph" title="Heterotroph">Heterotrophs</a>, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as <a href="/wiki/Cellular_respiration" title="Cellular respiration">cellular respiration</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Prehistory" title="Prehistory">prehistory</a>, humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>, the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nutrients" title="Nutrients">nutrients</a> for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grasses" title="Grasses">grasses</a> inedible to humans.</p>
<p>The more recent discoveries of <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> are modern extensions of this trend. These <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of <a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a>. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alternative_fuels" title="Alternative fuels">alternative fuels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe" title="Malthusian catastrophe">Malthusian catastrophe</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_urbanism" title="New urbanism">new urbanism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>).</p>

<p>The effect of sunlight is relevant to <a href="/wiki/Painting" title="Painting">painting</a>, evidenced for instance in works of <a href="/wiki/Claude_Monet" title="Claude Monet">Claude Monet</a> on outdoor scenes and landscapes.</p>

<p>Many people find direct sunlight to be too <a href="/wiki/Brightness" title="Brightness">bright</a> for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sun is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear <a href="/wiki/Sunglasses" title="Sunglasses">sunglasses</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">Cars</a>, many <a href="/wiki/Helmet" title="Helmet">helmets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cap" title="Cap">caps</a> are equipped with <a href="/wiki/Visor" title="Visor">visors</a> to block the sun from direct vision when the sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of <a href="/wiki/Wall" title="Wall">walls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Window_blind" title="Window blind">window blinds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Awning" title="Awning">awnings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Window_shutter" title="Window shutter">shutters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Curtain" title="Curtain">curtains</a>, or nearby <a href="/wiki/Shade_tree" title="Shade tree">shade trees</a>.</p>
<p>In colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the <a href="/wiki/Shade_(shadow)" title="Shade (shadow)">shade</a>. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, <a href="/wiki/Umbrella" title="Umbrella">parasols</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, the sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on earth.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sunbathing">Sunbathing</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sun_tanning" title="Sun tanning">Sun tanning</a></div>

<p>Sunbathing is a popular <a href="/wiki/Leisure" title="Leisure">leisure</a> activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include <a href="/wiki/Beach" title="Beach">beaches</a>, open air <a href="/wiki/Swimming_pool" title="Swimming pool">swimming pools</a>, <a href="/wiki/Park" title="Park">parks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Garden" title="Garden">gardens</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sidewalk_cafe" title="Sidewalk cafe">sidewalk cafes</a>. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go <a href="/wiki/Nudity" title="Nudity">nude</a>. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tanning_bed" title="Tanning bed">sunbed</a> that generates <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.</p>
<p>For many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's <a href="/wiki/Human_skin_color" title="Human skin color">skin color</a> (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, <a href="/wiki/Vacation" title="Vacation">vacations/holidays</a>, and health. Some people prefer <a href="/wiki/Naturism" title="Naturism">naked</a> sunbathing so that an "all-over" or "even" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.</p>
<p>For people suffering from <a href="/wiki/Psoriasis" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, sunbathing is an effective way of healing the symptoms.</p>
<p>Skin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called <a href="/wiki/Melanocyte" title="Melanocyte">melanocytes</a>, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_on_human_health">Effects on human health</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Health_effects_of_sunlight_exposure" title="Health effects of sunlight exposure">Health effects of sunlight exposure</a></div>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation" title="Ultraviolet radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vitamin_D3" title="Vitamin D3">vitamin D<sub>3</sub></a> and a <a href="/wiki/Mutagen" title="Mutagen">mutagen</a>. A dietary supplement can supply <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_D" title="Vitamin D">vitamin D</a> without this mutagenic effect, but bypasses natural mechanisms that would prevent overdoses of vitamin D generated internally from sunlight. Vitamin D has a wide range of positive health effects, which include strengthening bones and possibly inhibiting the growth of some cancers. Sun exposure has also been associated with the timing of <a href="/wiki/Melatonin" title="Melatonin">melatonin</a> synthesis, maintenance of normal <a href="/wiki/Circadian_rhythm" title="Circadian rhythm">circadian rhythms</a>, and reduced risk of <a href="/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder" title="Seasonal affective disorder">seasonal affective disorder</a>.</p>
<p>Long-term sunlight exposure is known to be associated with the development of <a href="/wiki/Skin_cancer" title="Skin cancer">skin cancer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Photoaging" title="Photoaging">skin aging</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Immune_suppression" title="Immune suppression">immune suppression</a>, and eye diseases such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cataracts" title="Cataracts">cataracts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macular_degeneration" title="Macular degeneration">macular degeneration</a>. Short-term overexposure is the cause of <a href="/wiki/Sunburn" title="Sunburn">sunburn</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Snow_blindness" title="Snow blindness">snow blindness</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_retinopathy" title="Solar retinopathy">solar retinopathy</a>.</p>
<p>UV rays, and therefore sunlight and sunlamps, are the only listed <a href="/wiki/Carcinogen" title="Carcinogen">carcinogens</a> that are known to have health benefits, and a number of public health organizations state that there needs to be a balance between the risks of having too much sunlight or too little. There is a general consensus that sunburn should always be avoided.</p>
