<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_history">Early history</span></h3>
<p>Darlington started life as an <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> settlement. The name Darlington derives from the Anglo-Saxon <i>Dearthington</i>, which seemingly meant 'the settlement of Deornoth's people' but by Norman times the name had changed to Derlinton. During the 17th and 18th centuries the town was generally known by the name of Darnton.</p>
<p>Darlington has a historic market area in the town centre. Built in 1183, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grade_I" title="Grade I">Grade I</a> listed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cuthbert_of_Lindisfarne" title="Cuthbert of Lindisfarne">St Cuthbert</a>'s Church is one of the most important early English churches in the north of England. However the oldest church in the town happens to be that of <a href="/wiki/Andrew_the_Apostle" title="Andrew the Apostle">St Andrew</a>'s Church built around 1125 and presides in the <a href="/wiki/Haughton-le-Skerne" title="Haughton-le-Skerne">Haughton</a> area of Darlington.</p>
<p>Visiting during the 18th century, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" title="Daniel Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> noted that the town was eminent for "good bleaching of linen, so that I have known cloth brought from Scotland to be bleached here". However he also disparaged the town, writing that it had "nothing remarkable but dirt" (the roads would typically be unpaved at the time).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Durham_Ox" title="Durham Ox">Durham Ox</a> came from Darlington.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19th-century_industry">19th-century industry</span></h3>

<p>During the early 19th century, Darlington remained a small market town. As the century progressed, powerful <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quaker" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> families such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pease_family_(Darlington)" title="Pease family (Darlington)">Pease</a> and <a href="/wiki/Backhouse%27s_Bank" title="Backhouse's Bank">Backhouse</a> families were prominent employers and philanthropists in the area. Darlington's most famous landmark, the clock tower, was a gift to the town by the industrialist <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Pease_(railway_pioneer)" title="Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)">Joseph Pease</a> in 1864. The clock's face was produced by <a href="/wiki/T._Cooke_%26_Sons" title="T. Cooke &amp; Sons">T. Cooke &amp; Sons</a> of <a href="/wiki/York" title="York">York</a>, and the tower bells were cast by <a href="/wiki/John_Warner_%26_Sons" title="John Warner &amp; Sons">John Warner &amp; Sons</a> of nearby <a href="/wiki/Norton,_County_Durham" title="Norton, County Durham">Norton-on-Tees</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Darlington_Mechanics_Institute" title="Darlington Mechanics Institute">Darlington Mechanics Institute</a> was opened in 1854 by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Pease_Nichol" title="Elizabeth Pease Nichol">Elizabeth Pease Nichol</a>, who had made the largest donation towards its building costs. The 91-acre South Park was redeveloped into its current form in 1853, with financial backing from the Backhouse family. <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Waterhouse" title="Alfred Waterhouse">Alfred Waterhouse</a>, responsible for London's <a href="/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London" title="Natural History Museum, London">Natural History Museum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manchester_Town_Hall" title="Manchester Town Hall">Manchester Town Hall</a>, designed the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grade_II" title="Grade II">Grade II</a> listed Victorian Market Hall in 1860, and also the Backhouse's Bank building, now a branch of <a href="/wiki/Barclays" title="Barclays">Barclays</a>, in 1864, the latter taking three years to complete. <a href="/wiki/George_Gordon_Hoskins" title="George Gordon Hoskins">George Gordon Hoskins</a> was responsible for much of the town's architecture in this period, such as <i>The King's Hotel</i>. The <i>Darlington Free Library</i> was built with funding from <a href="/wiki/Edward_Pease_(railway_pioneer)" title="Edward Pease (railway pioneer)">Edward Pease</a>, and opened in 1884.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Railways">Railways</span></h4>
<p>Darlington is known for its associations with the birth of railways. This is celebrated in the town at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Darlington_Railway_Centre_and_Museum" title="Darlington Railway Centre and Museum">Darlington Railway Centre and Museum</a>. The world's first passenger rail journey was between <a href="/wiki/Shildon" title="Shildon">Shildon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stockton-on-Tees" title="Stockton-on-Tees">Stockton-on-Tees</a> via Darlington, on the <a href="/wiki/Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway" title="Stockton and Darlington Railway">Stockton and Darlington Railway</a> in 1825.</p>
<p>The town later became an important centre for railway manufacturing. An early railway works was the <a href="/wiki/Hopetown_Carriage_Works" title="Hopetown Carriage Works">Hopetown Carriage Works</a> (est.1853) which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The engineering firm of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_and_Alfred_Kitching" title="William and Alfred Kitching">William and Alfred Kitching</a> also manufactured locomotives in the 19th century. The town developed to have three significant works; the largest of these was the main line <a href="/wiki/Darlington_Works" title="Darlington Works">Darlington Works</a>, whose main works were known as the North Road Shops which opened in 1863 and closed in 1966. Another was <a href="/wiki/Robert_Stephenson_and_Company" title="Robert Stephenson and Company">Robert Stephenson &amp; Co.</a> (colloquially: "Stivvies"), who moved to Darlington from <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in 1902, became Robert Stephensons &amp; Hawthorns in 1937, were absorbed by <a href="/wiki/English_Electric" title="English Electric">English Electric</a> around 1960, and closed by 1964. The third was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Faverdale_Wagon_Works" title="Faverdale Wagon Works">Faverdale Wagon Works</a>, established in 1923 and closed in 1962, which in the 1950s was a UK pioneer in the application of mass-production techniques to the manufacture of railway goods wagons.</p>
<p>To commemorate the town's contribution to the railways, <a href="/wiki/David_Mach" title="David Mach">David Mach</a>'s 1997 work "Train" is located alongside the A66, close to the original Stockton–Darlington railway. It is a life-size brick sculpture of a steaming locomotive emerging from a tunnel, made from 185,000 "Accrington Nori" bricks. The work had a budget of £760,000.</p>
<p>For 19 years, the <a href="/wiki/A1_Steam_Locomotive_Trust" title="A1 Steam Locomotive Trust">A1 Steam Locomotive Trust</a> built a 50th member of the long withdrawn <a href="/wiki/LNER_Peppercorn_Class_A1" title="LNER Peppercorn Class A1">LNER Peppercorn Class A1</a> engine, called <a href="/wiki/LNER_Peppercorn_Class_A1_60163_Tornado" title="LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado">'Tornado'</a> and numbered 60163, from scratch in the 1853 former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway_Carriage_Works" title="Stockton and Darlington Railway Carriage Works">Stockton and Darlington Railway Carriage Works</a> at Hopetown.

<p>In 1939, Darlington had the most cinema seats per head of population in the United Kingdom. The town centre has undergone a full refurbishment entitled <i>The Pedestrian Heart</i>, which has seen the majority of the town centre pedestrianised. Initially, the project received criticism surrounding changes to public transport, and removal of Victorian features along High Row. There is now growing evidence, however, that the now-completed changes are meeting with local approval. Then in 2014, the town saw the revamp of one of its old cinemas, The Majestic, from a failing Bingo Hall into what it is now, fully restored to its former glory. The space features a soft-play area downstairs and will feature a <a href="/wiki/Restaurant" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theatre" title="Theatre">theatre</a> in the upper floor.</p>
<p>In August 2008 the King's Hotel in the town centre was devastated by fire, severely damaging the roof and 100 bedrooms. Several shops, including <a href="/wiki/Woolworths_Group" title="Woolworths Group">Woolworths</a>, were damaged and had to close for weeks afterwards. No one was killed in the blaze. The hotel was carefully restored to its former glory and re-opened in 2012.</p>

Another major employer in the area is the English division of the <a href="/wiki/Student_Loans_Company" title="Student Loans Company">Student Loans Company</a>, Student Finance England, who are based at Lingfield Point and employ over 1,000 people. Nevertheless, there are major engineering sites, with both <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Bridge" title="Cleveland Bridge">Cleveland Bridge</a> and the industrial arm of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AMEC" title="AMEC">AMEC</a> headquartered in the town. Another major firm within the engineering industry based in the town is <a href="/wiki/Cummins" title="Cummins">Cummins</a> which has a large scale engine building facility in the Morton Park area of Darlington. UK retail company <a href="/wiki/Argos" title="Argos">Argos</a> have their largest warehouse distribution centre in the North of England located in Darlington, within Faverdale Industrial Estate to the North West of the town. Other large service sector companies with offices in the town include Darlington Building Society, Bannatyne Fitness Ltd and the national vehicle rental company Northgate, which is headquartered in the town; also within the Morton Park area.</p>
<p>As well as the large engineering sites based in the town, Darlington is also home to many businesses within the modern and developing industries including Information Technology. With large firms such as Infoserve Ltd having offices within the Morton Park area to the east of Darlington, located next to the A66 Darlington Eastern Bypass.</p>
<p>Close to the Darlington A66 Bypass is also the Link66 redevelopment scheme, which is a large plot of land close to the Morton Park site. It is hoped developers will see potential in the site due to its excellent transport links with fast access to the town centre and central park regeneration zone via the new Darlington Eastern Transport Corridor constructed in 2008. While also being in close proximity to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A1(M)" title="A1(M)">A1(M)</a> Motorway which heads south to London and north to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In November 2012, a deal was signed between Darlington Borough Council and developer Terrace Hill for a £30 million re-development of the site of the former Feethams bus depot. The development includes a new multiplex cinema run by <a href="/wiki/Vue_Cinemas" title="Vue Cinemas">Vue Cinemas</a> to serve Darlington and the wider South Durham area, as the area currently has no multiplex cinema.

BT Group cites their decision to include Darlington in the national rollour of multi-provider fibre optic (cable) broadband as necessary due to the towns relatively large amount of IT demanding firms and future plans for developments including space for high-tech firms. Darlington Borough Council, residents and local businesses praised the decision by BT Group and it is hoped the investment will attract enterprise to the town, potentially creating employment for residents and boosting the economy.</p>
<p>The Morton Park area of Darlington is currently undergoing a partial redevelopment, with areas of unused waste land being redeveloped into modern industrial and office space, the developments add to the plans for redevelopment of the current Council depot on Central Park which is also to be redeveloped into commercial space and the Link66 scheme also close to Morton Park.

<p>Darlington is historically a market town with a well established weekly outdoor market and an indoor market located underneath the town clock on Prebend Row. Also located on Prebend Row is the Cornmill Shopping centre which is the main retail area of Darlington. The market square is one of the biggest in the country.</p>

<p>Darlington has been subject to increasing amounts of inward investment in recent years with the completion of large scale local council sponsored schemes such as the 2007 Town Centre Pedestrian Heart Project worth 10 million pounds, which saw most of Darlington Town Centre modernised with an emphasis on fewer vehicles in the centre and roads pedestrianised completely. The town is also received further investment worth 170 million pounds with the creation of Central Park, a new industrial, residential, cultural and education park which includes hundreds of new affordable homes, Darlington College Campus, Teesside University Darlington Campus, luxury office space, retail units and a new local centre. The Central Park construction site stretches from the current Darlington College campus on Haughton road to the Darlington Railway station entrance at Yarm Road.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the local council, regional development agency and government departments are consulting about investing in an upgrade of Darlington's A66 Eastern Bypass to dual carriageway to improve congestion and journey times, as well as to prevent the tees valley region from suffering due to the road currently being single track passing Darlington which is essentially the gateway to the tees valley region.</p>
<p>All of the investment in recent years and planned investment with large scale public sector support makes Darlington the most invested in Borough in the Tees Valley region, with Stockton a close second. The Civic Theatre is a popular arts venue in the town, hosting a mix of musicals, dramas, plays and pantomimes. The smaller but well-used Arts Centre, founded in 1982, featured smaller events, film screenings and more experimental material; however this closed in 2012.</p>
<p>Darlington is well known within the North of England as being tolerant of diverse lifestyles as it was the first town in England to allow same-sex civil ceremonies in 2001. The town thus has a small gay scene developed over a number of years by the local LGBT community, hosting a weekly Gay Night held every Monday night supported by over 7 venues in Darlington town centre. The scene has grown to become a beacon of LGBT entertainment in the region, and particularly the Tees Valley with the support of the local LGBT support charity Gay Advice Darlington/Durham (GADD), Darlington Gay Scene Collective (DGSC) as well as a large selection of local bars and clubs. The town hosts an annual Gay Pride Festival which comprises a series of celebrations of local LGBT culture and acceptance held at venues across the town.</p>
<p>The Rhythm'n'Brews festival is a music and real ale festival normally held in early autumn, with many rock, blues and jazz acts playing at various venues around Darlington.</p>
<p>The Forum Music Centre, opened in 2004, hosts regular live music events, from Ska and Punk to Indie and Classic Rock. It also runs a popular comedy club. As well as live music, the facility houses a state of the art recording studio and several rehearsal rooms.

<p>Darlington Library, an impressive Grade II listed building situated in Crown Street, was a gift to the town from Edward Pease (1834–1880), a leading Darlington Quaker. He left £10,000 in his will to build a free library in Darlington or for other educational purposes. The people of Darlington voted to adopt the Free Libraries Act, and the town's first free library was officially opened on 23 October 1885 by his daughter, Lady Lymington. The building now houses the Central Lending Department, Reference Library and Centre for Local Studies.</p>
<p>The Jamia Mosque and Islamic Society of Darlington is located in the North Lodge Terrace area of the town, an area with a high proportion of ethnic minority residents.</p>
