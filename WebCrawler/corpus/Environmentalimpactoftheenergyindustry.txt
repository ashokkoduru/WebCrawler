<p>The <b>environmental impact of the <a href="/wiki/Energy_industry" title="Energy industry">energy industry</a></b> is diverse. <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">Energy</a> has been harnessed by human beings for millennia. Initially it was with the use of <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a> for light, heat, cooking and for safety, and its use can be traced back at least 1.9 million years. In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization" title="Renewable energy commercialization">commercialization of various renewable energy sources</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change" title="Attribution of recent climate change">Attribution of recent climate change</a></div>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific consensus on global warming and climate change</a> is that it is caused by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthropogenic_greenhouse_gas_emissions" title="Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions">anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions</a>, the majority of which comes from burning <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> with <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> and some agricultural practices being also major contributors.</p>
<p>Although there is a highly publicized <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_denial" title="Climate change denial">denial of climate change</a>, the vast majority of scientists working in <a href="/wiki/Climatology" title="Climatology">climatology</a> accept that it is due to human activity. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IPCC" title="IPCC">IPCC</a> report <i>Climate Change 2007: Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability</i> predicts that climate change will cause shortages of food and water and increased risk of flooding that will affect billions of people, particularly those living in poverty.</p>
<p>One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">Externality</a> comparisons between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paul_Scherrer_Institut" title="Paul Scherrer Institut">Paul Scherrer Institut</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Stuttgart" title="University of Stuttgart">University of Stuttgart</a> which was funded by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>. According to that study, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> electricity produces the lowest CO2 emissions, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind</a> produces the second-lowest, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear energy</a> produces the third-lowest and <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> produces the fourth-lowest.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same research study (ExternE, Externalities of Energy), undertaken from 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value, and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_particulate_matter" title="Atmospheric particulate matter">airborne particulate matter</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides" title="Nitrogen oxides">nitrogen oxides</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chromium_VI" title="Chromium VI">chromium VI</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> emissions produced by these sources, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that these external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1%-2% of the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union" title="Economy of the European Union">EU’s entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</a>, and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included. The study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power, per unit of energy delivered, was €0.0019/kWh, which was found to be lower than that of many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable" title="Renewable">renewable</a> sources including that caused by <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a> and photovoltaic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_panels" title="Solar panels">solar panels</a>, and was thirty times lower than coal at €0.06/kWh, or 6 cents/kWh, with the energy sources of the lowest external environmental and health costs associated with it being <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> at €0.0009/kWh.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">Biofuel</a> is defined as solid, liquid or gaseous <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a> obtained from relatively recently lifeless or living biological material and is different from <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>, which are derived from long-dead biological material.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Firewood">Firewood</span></h4>
<p>Unsustainable <a href="/wiki/Firewood" title="Firewood">firewood</a> harvesting can lead to loss of <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a> due to loss of forest cover. An example of this is a 40-year study done by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Leeds" title="University of Leeds">University of Leeds</a> of African forests, which account for a third of the world's total <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical_forest" title="Tropical forest">tropical forest</a> which demonstrates that <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> is a significant <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sink" title="Carbon sink">carbon sink</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> expert, Lee White states that "To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly 5 billion tonnes of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests is at issue.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.N." title="U.N.">U.N.</a> the African continent is losing forest twice as fast as the rest of the world. "Once upon a time, Africa boasted seven million square kilometers of forest but a third of that has been lost, most of it to <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fossil_fuel_use">Fossil fuel use</span></h3>

<p>The three <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> types are <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>. It was estimated by the <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> that in 2006 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.8%, coal 26.6%, natural gas 22.9%, amounting to an 86% share for fossil fuels in primary energy production in the world.</p>
<p>In 2013 the burning of fossil fuels produced around 32 billion <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tonnes" title="Tonnes">tonnes</a> (32 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigatonne" title="Gigatonne">gigatonnes</a>) of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and additional <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>. This caused negative <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externalities</a> of $4.9 trillion due to global warming and health problems (&gt; 150 $/ton carbon dioxide). Carbon dioxide is one of the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> that enhances <a href="/wiki/Radiative_forcing" title="Radiative forcing">radiative forcing</a> and contributes to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, causing the <a href="/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record" title="Instrumental temperature record">average surface temperature</a> of the Earth to rise in response, which <a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">climate scientists</a> agree will cause major adverse <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">effects</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Coal">Coal</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_the_coal_industry" title="Environmental impact of the coal industry">Environmental impact of the coal industry</a></div>
<p>The environmental impact of coal mining and burning is diverse. Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990 required the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants. After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Petroleum">Petroleum</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_the_petroleum_industry" title="Environmental impact of the petroleum industry">Environmental impact of the petroleum industry</a></div>

<p>The environmental impact of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> is often negative because it is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a> to almost all forms of life. The possibility of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> exists. Petroleum, commonly referred to as oil, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gas">Gas</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">Natural gas</a> is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel, producing less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either coal or oil., and far fewer pollutants than other fossil fuels. However, in absolute terms it does contribute substantially to global carbon emissions, and this contribution is projected to grow. According to the <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">IPCC Fourth Assessment Report</a>, in 2004 natural gas produced about 5,300 Mt/yr of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while coal and oil produced 10,600 and 10,200 respectively (Figure 4.4); but by 2030, according to an updated version of the <a href="/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios#B2" title="Special Report on Emissions Scenarios">SRES B2</a> emissions scenario, natural gas would be the source of 11,000 Mt/yr, with coal and oil now 8,400 and 17,200 respectively. (<a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions" title="List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions">Total global emissions</a> for 2004 were estimated at over 27,200 Mt.)</p>
<p>In addition, natural gas itself is a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere but is released in smaller amounts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electricity_generation">Electricity generation</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_electricity_generation" title="Environmental impact of electricity generation">Environmental impact of electricity generation</a></div>
<p>The environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power. This power is normally <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">generated</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_plant" title="Power plant">power plants</a> that convert some other kind of energy into electrical power. Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reservoirs">Reservoirs</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs" title="Environmental impact of reservoirs">Environmental impact of reservoirs</a></div>
<p>The environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases. <a href="/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">Dams</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoirs</a> can be used to supply <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a>, generate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> power, increasing the water supply for <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>, provide recreational opportunities and for flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental—to both the environment and surrounding human populations— has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of <a href="/wiki/Llyn_Celyn" title="Llyn Celyn">Llyn Celyn</a> and the flooding of <a href="/wiki/Capel_Celyn" title="Capel Celyn">Capel Celyn</a> provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> and other similar projects throughout <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> have generated considerable environmental and political debate.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nuclear_power">Nuclear power</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_nuclear_power" title="Environmental impact of nuclear power">Environmental impact of nuclear power</a></div>

<p>The environmental impact of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> results from the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_cycle" title="Nuclear fuel cycle">nuclear fuel cycle</a>, operation, and the effects of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_accidents" title="Nuclear accidents">nuclear accidents</a>.</p>
<p>The routine health risks and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emission" title="Greenhouse gas emission">greenhouse gas emissions</a> from nuclear fission power are smaller than those associated with coal, oil and gas. However, there is a "catastrophic risk" potential if containment fails, which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over-heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment. The most long-lived radioactive wastes, including spent nuclear fuel, must be contained and isolated from humans and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years. The public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable <a href="/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement" title="Anti-nuclear movement">public opposition to nuclear power</a>.</p>
<p>The 1979 <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Three Mile Island accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> and 1986 <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>, along with high construction costs, ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity. A further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 Japanese tsunami which damaged the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_I_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant">Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant</a>, resulting in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_I_nuclear_accidents" title="Fukushima I nuclear accidents">hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns</a> classified as a <a href="/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" title="International Nuclear Event Scale">Level 7</a> event. The large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20 km exclusion zone set up around the power plant, similar to the 30 km radius <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone" title="Chernobyl Exclusion Zone">Chernobyl Exclusion Zone</a> still in effect.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wind_power">Wind power</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_wind_power" title="Environmental impact of wind power">Environmental impact of wind power</a></div>

<p>The <b>environmental impact of wind power</b> when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IPCC" title="IPCC">IPCC</a>, in assessments of the <a href="/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources" title="Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources">life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources</a>, wind turbines have a <a href="/wiki/Median" title="Median">median</a> value of between 12 and 11 (<a href="/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">g</a>CO<sub>2</sub><a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">eq</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/KWh" title="KWh">kWh</a>) depending, respectively, on if offshore or onshore turbines are being assessed. Compared with other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_carbon_power" title="Low carbon power">low carbon power</a> sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">global warming potential</a> per unit of electrical energy generated.</p>
<p>While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it, as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use.</p>
<p>There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peat_bogs" title="Peat bogs">peat bogs</a>, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.</p>
<p>There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.</p>
<p>Aesthetic aspects of wind turbines and resulting changes of the visual landscape are significant. Conflicts arise especially in scenic and heritage protected landscapes.</p>
