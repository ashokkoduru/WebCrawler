<p>The <b>Neolithic Revolution</b> or <b>Neolithic Demographic Transition</b>, sometimes called the <b>Agricultural Revolution</b>, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunting and gathering</a> to one of <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and settlement, allowing the ability to handle an increasingly larger population. These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed. This new knowledge led to the domestication of plants.</p>
<p>Archaeological data indicates that the <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> of various types of plants and animals evolved in separate locations worldwide, starting in the <a href="/wiki/Geologic_time_scale" title="Geologic time scale">geological</a> <a href="/wiki/Epoch_(geology)" title="Epoch (geology)">epoch</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Holocene" title="Holocene">Holocene</a> around 12,500 years ago. It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, with a switch to agriculture which led to a downturn in human nutrition.</p>
<p>The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_history" title="Human history">human pre-history</a> into <a href="/wiki/Sedentism" title="Sedentism">sedentary</a> (non-<a href="/wiki/Nomad" title="Nomad">nomadic</a>) <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">societies</a> based in built-up <a href="/wiki/Village" title="Village">villages</a> and <a href="/wiki/Town" title="Town">towns</a>. These societies radically modified their <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">natural environment</a> by means of specialized food-crop cultivation (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>) which allowed extensive surplus food production.</p>
<p>These developments provided the basis for <a href="/wiki/Population_density" title="Population density">densely populated</a> settlements, specialization and <a href="/wiki/Division_of_labour" title="Division of labour">division of labour</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trading economies</a>, the development of non-portable <a href="/wiki/Art" title="Art">art</a> and <a href="/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideologies</a>, depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g., <a href="/wiki/History_of_writing" title="History of writing">writing</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> ownership. Personal land and private property ownership led to hierarchical society, an elite <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">Social class</a>, comprising a <a href="/wiki/Nobility" title="Nobility">nobility</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polity" title="Polity">polity</a>, and military.

<p>The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of <a href="/wiki/Social_evolution" title="Social evolution">social evolution</a>.

<p>The term <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> was coined in 1923 by <a href="/wiki/V._Gordon_Childe" title="V. Gordon Childe">V. Gordon Childe</a> to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in Middle Eastern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.</p>
<p>The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the <a href="/wiki/Fertile_Crescent" title="Fertile Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a> and perhaps 8000 BC in the <a href="/wiki/Kuk_Swamp" title="Kuk Swamp">Kuk Early Agricultural Site</a> of <a href="/wiki/Melanesia" title="Melanesia">Melanesia</a>. This transition everywhere seems associated with a change from a largely <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nomadic" title="Nomadic">nomadic</a> <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> way of life to a more <a href="/wiki/Settler" title="Settler">settled</a>, agrarian-based one, with the inception of the <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> of various plant and animal species—depending on the species locally available, and probably also influenced by local culture. Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.</p>
<p>There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by <a href="/wiki/Raphael_Pumpelly" title="Raphael Pumpelly">Raphael Pumpelly</a> in 1908, popularized by <a href="/wiki/V._Gordon_Childe" title="V. Gordon Childe">V. Gordon Childe</a> in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book <i>Man Makes Himself</i>. This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oases" title="Oases">oases</a> where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Hilly_Flanks" title="Hilly Flanks">Hilly Flanks</a> hypothesis, proposed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Robert_Braidwood" title="Robert Braidwood">Robert Braidwood</a> in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the <a href="/wiki/Taurus_Mountains" title="Taurus Mountains">Taurus</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zagros_mountains" title="Zagros mountains">Zagros mountains</a>, where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.</li>
<li>The Feasting model by Brian Hayden suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.</li>
<li>The Demographic theories proposed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carl_Sauer" title="Carl Sauer">Carl Sauer</a> and adapted by <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Binford" title="Lewis Binford">Lewis Binford</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kent_Flannery" title="Kent Flannery">Kent Flannery</a> posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.</li>
<li>The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by <a href="/wiki/David_Rindos" title="David Rindos">David Rindos</a> and others, views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it led to specialization of location and then full-fledged domestication.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Peter_Richerson" title="Peter Richerson">Peter Richerson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Boyd_(anthropologist)" title="Robert Boyd (anthropologist)">Robert Boyd</a>, and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Robert_Bettinger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert Bettinger (page does not exist)">Robert Bettinger</a> make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Holocene" title="Holocene">Holocene</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Wright" title="Ronald Wright">Ronald Wright</a>'s book and Massey Lecture Series <i><a href="/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Progress" title="A Short History of Progress">A Short History of Progress</a></i> popularized this hypothesis.</li>
<li>The postulated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Younger_Dryas_event" title="Younger Dryas event">Younger Dryas impact event</a>, claimed to be in part responsible for <a href="/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event" title="Quaternary extinction event">megafauna extinction</a> and ending the last <a href="/wiki/Glacial_period" title="Glacial period">glacial period</a>, could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive. The agrarian revolution itself is a reflection of typical overpopulation by certain species following initial events during extinction eras; this overpopulation itself ultimately propagates the extinction event.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Leonid_Grinin" title="Leonid Grinin">Leonid Grinin</a> argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Andrew_M._T._Moore" title="Andrew M. T. Moore">Andrew Moore</a> suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the <a href="/wiki/Levant" title="Levant">Levant</a>, possibly beginning during the <a href="/wiki/Epipaleolithic" title="Epipaleolithic">Epipaleolithic</a>. In <i>"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"</i>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Frank_Hole&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Frank Hole (page does not exist)">Frank Hole</a> further expanded the relationship between plant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animal_domestication" title="Animal domestication">animal domestication</a>. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals (<a href="/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sheep" title="Sheep">sheep</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">cattle</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pigs" title="Pigs">pigs</a>) were not found until the sixth millennium at <a href="/wiki/Tell_Ramad" title="Tell Ramad">Tell Ramad</a>. Hole concluded that <i>"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the <a href="/wiki/Euphrates" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> basin, perhaps as far south as the <a href="/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, especially where <a href="/wiki/Wadi" title="Wadi">wadis</a> carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."</i></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Domestication_of_plants">Domestication of plants</span></h2>

<p>Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000BCE, human activity resulted in the <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selective breeding</a> of cereal grasses (beginning with <a href="/wiki/Emmer" title="Emmer">emmer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Einkorn" title="Einkorn">einkorn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants that possessed traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.</p>
<p>Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_founder_crops" title="Neolithic founder crops">Neolithic founder crops</a> were named by <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Zohary&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Daniel Zohary (page does not exist)">Daniel Zohary</a>, who highlighted importance of the three <a href="/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereals</a>, and suggesting domestication of <a href="/wiki/Flax" title="Flax">flax</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pea" title="Pea">pea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chickpea" title="Chickpea">chickpea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vicia_ervilia" title="Vicia ervilia">bitter vetch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lentil" title="Lentil">lentil</a> came a little later. Based on analysis of the <a href="/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a> of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taxa" title="Taxa">taxa</a> that spread in an arc from the <a href="/wiki/Levantine_corridor" title="Levantine corridor">Levantine corridor</a> around the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertile_crescent" title="Fertile crescent">fertile crescent</a> and later into Europe. <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Hillman" title="Gordon Hillman">Gordon Hillman</a> and Stuart Davies carried out experiments with wild wheat varieties to show that the process of domestication would have happened over a relatively short period of between twenty and two hundred years. Some of these pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned, sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later: <a href="/wiki/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a>, tried and abandoned in Neolithic <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe, thousands of years after the earliest agriculture. Wild lentils present a different challenge that needed to be overcome: most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year; the first evidence of lentil domestication, breaking dormancy in their first year, was found in the early Neolithic at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jerf_el_Ahmar" title="Jerf el Ahmar">Jerf el Ahmar</a> (in modern Syria), and quickly spread south to the <a href="/wiki/Netiv_HaGdud" title="Netiv HaGdud">Netiv HaGdud</a> site in the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Valley_(Middle_East)" title="Jordan Valley (Middle East)">Jordan Valley</a>. This process of <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger, more easily harvested, more dependable in storage and more useful to the human population.</p>

<p>Selectively propagated <a href="/wiki/Ficus" title="Ficus">figs</a>, wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of <a href="/wiki/Gilgal_I" title="Gilgal I">Gilgal I</a>, where in 2006 archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by <a href="/wiki/Intensive_gathering" title="Intensive gathering">intensive gathering</a>, at strata datable c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would <a href="/wiki/Crop_yield" title="Crop yield">yield</a> surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually <a href="/wiki/Granary" title="Granary">granaries</a> were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.</p>
<p>The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture_in_the_Fertile_Crescent">Agriculture in the Fertile Crescent</span></h3>
<p>Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The <a href="/wiki/Fertile_Crescent" title="Fertile Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a> region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley) four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea) and flax. The Mediterranean climate consists of a long dry season with a short period of rain, which may have favored small plants with large seeds, like wheat and barley. The Fertile Crescent also had a large area of varied geographical settings and altitudes and this variety may have made agriculture more profitable for former hunter-gatherers in this region in comparison with other areas with a similar climate .</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">Domestication</a></div>
<p>When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand. Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders. The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs (East Asia, about 15,000 years ago), sheep, goats, cows, and pigs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Domestication_of_animals_in_the_Middle_East">Domestication of animals in the Middle East</span></h3>

<p>The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domesticate" title="Domesticate">domesticate</a> the <a href="/wiki/Dromedary" title="Dromedary">dromedary</a> camel. <a href="/wiki/Henri_Fleisch" title="Henri Fleisch">Henri Fleisch</a> discovered and termed the <a href="/wiki/Shepherd_Neolithic" title="Shepherd Neolithic">Shepherd Neolithic</a> <a href="/wiki/Flint" title="Flint">flint</a> industry from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bekaa_Valley" title="Bekaa Valley">Bekaa Valley</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest <a href="/wiki/Nomad" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> <a href="/wiki/Shepherd" title="Shepherd">shepherds</a>. He dated this industry to the <a href="/wiki/Epipaleolithic" title="Epipaleolithic">Epipaleolithic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pre-Pottery_Neolithic" title="Pre-Pottery Neolithic">Pre-Pottery Neolithic</a> as it is evidently not <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mesolithic" title="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> or even <a href="/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">Pottery</a> <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>. The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Afroeurasia" title="Afroeurasia">Afroeurasia</a>. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like <a href="/wiki/Jared_Diamond" title="Jared Diamond">Jared Diamond</a>, have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the <a href="/wiki/Fertile_Crescent" title="Fertile Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a> to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> to reach the Mediterranean climates of <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years. Similarly, the African <a href="/wiki/Zebu" title="Zebu">Zebu</a> of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_change">Social change</span></h3>
<p>It has long been taken for granted that the introduction of agriculture had been an unequivocal progress. This is now questioned in view of findings by archaeologists and paleopathologists showing that nutritional standards of Neolithic populations were generally inferior to that of hunter-gatherers, and that their life expectancy may well have been shorter too, in part due to diseases and harder work. Hunter-gatherers must have covered their food needs with about 20 hours work a week, while agriculture required much more and was at least as uncertain. The hunter-gatherers' diet was more varied and balanced than what agriculture later allowed. Average height went down from 5'10" (178 cm) for men and 5'6" (168 cm) for women to 5'5" (165 cm) and 5'1" (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels. Agriculturalists had more anaemias and vitamin deficiencies, more spinal deformations and more dental pathologies.</p>
<p>However, the decrease in individual nutrition was accompanied by an increase in population.</p>
<p>The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. <a href="/wiki/Jared_Diamond" title="Jared Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> (in <a href="/wiki/The_World_Until_Yesterday" title="The World Until Yesterday">The World Until Yesterday</a>) identifies the availability of milk and/or cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) child and a younger child concurrently, whereas this was not possible previously. The result is that a population can significantly more-rapidly increase its size than would otherwise be the case, resources permitting.</p>
<p>Recent analyses point out that agriculture also brought about deep social divisions and in particular encouraged <a href="/wiki/Gender_inequality" title="Gender inequality">inequality between the sexes</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subsequent_revolutions">Subsequent revolutions</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Andrew_Sherratt" title="Andrew Sherratt">Andrew Sherratt</a> has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the <a href="/wiki/Secondary_products_revolution" title="Secondary products revolution">secondary products revolution</a>. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat. The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/History_of_hide_materials" title="History of hide materials">hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Manure" title="Manure">manure</a> for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Wool" title="Wool">wool</a> (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and <a href="/wiki/Angora_goat" title="Angora goat">Angora goats</a>)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Working_animal" title="Working animal">traction</a> (from oxen, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Onagers" title="Onagers">onagers</a>, donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)</li>
<li>guarding and herding assistance (dogs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sherratt argues that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible <a href="/wiki/Nomadic_pastoralism" title="Nomadic pastoralism">nomadic pastoralism</a> in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the <a href="/wiki/Dromedary" title="Dromedary">dromedary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bactrian_camel" title="Bactrian camel">Bactrian camel</a>. Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts. Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urban_Revolution" title="Urban Revolution">Urban Revolution</a> in which the first cities were built.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Disease">Disease</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infectious_diseases" title="Infectious diseases">infectious diseases</a> spread from animals to humans are <a href="/wiki/Influenza" title="Influenza">influenza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a>. In concordance with a process of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>, the humans who first domesticated the big <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mammals" title="Mammals">mammals</a> quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside <a href="/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. For instance, the population of most <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and several <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Islands" title="Pacific Islands">Pacific Islands</a> have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_history_of_American_indigenous_peoples" title="Population history of American indigenous peoples">wiped out by European and African diseases</a> before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the <a href="/wiki/Inca_Empire" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a> did have a large domestic mammal, the <a href="/wiki/Llama" title="Llama">llama</a>, but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Technology">Technology</span></h3>

<p>In his book <i><a href="/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel" title="Guns, Germs, and Steel">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Jared_Diamond" title="Jared Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domesticable</a> plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as <a href="/wiki/Firearm" title="Firearm">firearms</a> and steel <a href="/wiki/Sword" title="Sword">swords</a>.</p>
<p>During and after the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" title="Age of Discovery">Age of Discovery</a>, European explorers, such as the Spanish <a href="/wiki/Conquistador" title="Conquistador">conquistadors</a>, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeogenetics">Archaeogenetics</span></h2>
<p>The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers.
