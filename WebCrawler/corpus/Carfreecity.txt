<p>A <b>carfree city</b> or <b>car free city</b> is a population center that relies primarily on <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public transport</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walking#As_transportation" title="Walking">walking</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Cycling" title="Cycling">cycling</a> for transport within the <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban area</a>. Carfree cities greatly reduce <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> dependency, <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Traffic_collision" title="Traffic collision">automobile crashes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Noise_pollution" title="Noise pollution">noise pollution</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Traffic_congestion" title="Traffic congestion">traffic congestion</a>. Some cities have one or more districts where motorized vehicles are prohibited, referred to as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car-free_zone" title="Car-free zone">car-free zones</a>. Many older cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa were founded centuries before the advent of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobile</a>, and some continue to have carfree areas in the oldest parts of the city -- especially in areas where it is impossible for cars to fit, e.g. in narrow <a href="/wiki/Alley" title="Alley">alleys</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>A theoretical design for a carfree city of one million people was first proposed by J.H. Crawford in 1996 and further refined in his books, <i>Carfree Cities</i> and <i>Carfree Design Manual</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span></h2>
<p>Some proposed car free cities are government planned and funded, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Masdar_city" title="Masdar city">Masdar city</a> and The "Great City" in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">China</a>, while others are planned privately such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Venus_Project" title="The Venus Project">The Venus Project</a> designs. In cities that are free of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roads" title="Roads">roads</a> there is not a need for <a href="/wiki/Road_tax" title="Road tax">taxation</a> to pay for the roads.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Process">Process</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Braess%27_paradox" title="Braess' paradox">Braess' paradox</a></div>
<p>Braess' paradox states that "for each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it, and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favorable to him, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in <b>longer</b> individual running times."</p>
<p>An existing city can be made a car-free city by strategic closures of streets to car traffic and by opening streets and squares to exclusive pedestrian use. A pedestrian and bicycle network gradually emerges and joins several parts of the city. Similarly, prompted by the same need to avoid conflicts with car traffic and enhance pedestrian movement, pedestrian networks have emerged below street level (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Underground_City" title="Underground City">Underground City</a>) or above road-level to connect large downtown areas. For new areas on the fringe of cities or new towns, two new complementary ideas have recently emerged. The concept of <a href="/wiki/Permeability_(spatial_and_transport_planning)" title="Permeability (spatial and transport planning)">Filtered Permeability</a> (2007) and a model for planning towns and subdivisions - the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fused_Grid" title="Fused Grid">Fused Grid</a> (2003). Both focus on shifting the balance of network design in favour of pedestrian and bicycle mobility.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/List_of_car-free_places" title="List of car-free places">List of car-free places</a></div>
<p>In Ghent, in Belgium, the entire city heart is car free: public transport, taxis and permit holders may enter but not exceed 5 km/h. In Strøget, Copenhagen, there is a large downtown car free shopping area.</p>
<p>The city of <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> serves as an example of how a modern city can <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alternatives_to_the_automobile" title="Alternatives to the automobile">function without cars</a>. This design was unintentional as the city was founded over 1,500 years ago, a long time before the invention of the automobile. Visitors who drive to the city or residents who own a car must park their car in a carpark outside of the city and then proceed either by foot or train into the city. The predominant method of transportation in the city is by foot, however most residents travel by motorised <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waterbus" title="Waterbus">waterbuses</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Vaporetto" title="Vaporetto">vaporetti</a></i>) which travel the city's canals.</p>
<p>Another example of a carfree place is <a href="/wiki/Mackinac_Island" title="Mackinac Island">Mackinac Island</a>, where cars are banned and the main transportation is by means of horses, bicycles, and boats.</p>
