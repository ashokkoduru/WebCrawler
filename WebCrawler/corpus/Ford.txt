<p>Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving <a href="/wiki/Assembly_line" title="Assembly line">assembly lines</a>; by 1914 these methods were known around the world as <a href="/wiki/Fordism" title="Fordism">Fordism</a>. Ford's former UK subsidiaries <a href="/wiki/Jaguar_Cars" title="Jaguar Cars">Jaguar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Land_Rover" title="Land Rover">Land Rover</a>, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to <a href="/wiki/Tata_Motors" title="Tata Motors">Tata Motors</a> in March 2008.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>
<p>Henry Ford's first attempt at a car company under his own name was the <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ford_Company" title="Henry Ford Company">Henry Ford Company</a> on November 3, 1901, which became the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cadillac_Motor_Company" title="Cadillac Motor Company">Cadillac Motor Company</a> on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name. The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors, most notably <a href="/wiki/John_Francis_Dodge" title="John Francis Dodge">John</a> and <a href="/wiki/Horace_Elgin_Dodge" title="Horace Elgin Dodge">Horace Dodge</a> (who would later found <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dodge_Brothers_Motor_Vehicle_Company" title="Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicle Company">their own</a> car company). During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mack_Avenue_Plant" title="Ford Mack Avenue Plant">Mack Avenue</a> and later its <a href="/wiki/Ford_Piquette_Avenue_Plant" title="Ford Piquette Avenue Plant">factory on Piquette Avenue</a> in <a href="/wiki/Detroit" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the <a href="/wiki/Assembly_line" title="Assembly line">assembly line</a> concept; and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a <a href="/wiki/Vertical_integration" title="Vertical integration">vertical integration</a> that seemed a better path for the era.</p>
<p>Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. As one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world, the Ford Motor Company has been in continuous family control for over 100 years.</p>
<p>After the first gasoline powered <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobile</a> was created in the year 1885 by <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> inventor <a href="/wiki/Karl_Benz" title="Karl Benz">Carl Benz</a> (<a href="/wiki/Benz_Patent-Motorwagen" title="Benz Patent-Motorwagen">Benz Patent-Motorwagen</a>), more efficient production methods were needed to make the automobile affordable for the middle-class; which Ford contributed to, for instance by introducing the first moving <a href="/wiki/Assembly_line" title="Assembly line">assembly line</a> in 1913 at its <a href="/wiki/Highland_Park_Ford_Plant" title="Highland Park Ford Plant">factory in Highland Park</a>.</p>
<p>Between 1903 and 1908 Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S, most of which sold in the hundreds or few thousands a year. In 1908 Ford introduced the mass-produced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Model_T" title="Model T">Model T</a>, which would sell in the millions. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927%E2%80%931931)" title="Ford Model A (1927–1931)">Model A</a>, the first car with safety glass in the windshield. Ford launched the first low priced V8 engine powered car in 1932.</p>
<p>In an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.</p>
<p>In 1929 Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to setup the <a href="/wiki/GAZ" title="GAZ">Gorky Automobile Plant</a> in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialisation of that country.</p>
<p>The creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's unlikely involvement in <a href="/wiki/Superconductivity" title="Superconductivity">superconductivity</a> research. In 1964 <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Ford_Research_Labs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ford Research Labs (page does not exist)">Ford Research Labs</a> made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or <a href="/wiki/SQUID" title="SQUID">SQUID</a>.</p>
<p>Ford offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash. Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and in the same year offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.</p>
<p>In late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time, the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Lincoln, Mercury and Edsel into "M-E-L," which reverted to "Lincoln-Mercury" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.</p>
<p>The Ford Mustang was introduced in 1964. In 1965 Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light.</p>
<p>With the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, "Have you driven a Ford, lately?" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994 respectively, Ford also acquired <a href="/wiki/Jaguar_Cars" title="Jaguar Cars">Jaguar Cars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin" title="Aston Martin">Aston Martin</a>. During the mid- to late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.</p>
<p>With the dawn of the new century, legacy healthcare costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Credit_Company" title="Ford Motor Credit Company">Ford Motor Credit Company</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="21st_century">21st century</span></h3>

<p>By 2005, both Ford and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_motors" title="General motors">GM</a>'s corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status, as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an <a href="/wiki/Aging_in_the_American_workforce" title="Aging in the American workforce">aging workforce</a>, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an over dependence on declining <a href="/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" title="Sport utility vehicle">SUV</a> sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased "incentives" (in the form of rebates or low interest financing) to offset declining demand. In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President <a href="/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)" title="Mark Fields (businessman)">Mark Fields</a> to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the Plan, named <i><a href="/wiki/The_Way_Forward" title="The Way Forward">The Way Forward</a></i>, at the December 7, 2005 board meeting of the company and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. "The Way Forward" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crossover_SUV" title="Crossover SUV">Crossover SUVs</a>" built on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unibody" title="Unibody">unibody</a> car platforms, rather than more <a href="/wiki/Body-on-frame" title="Body-on-frame">body-on-frame</a> chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid" title="Ford Escape Hybrid">Ford Escape Hybrid</a> SUV, Ford licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies to avoid patent infringements. Ford announced that it will team up with electricity supply company <a href="/wiki/Southern_California_Edison" title="Southern California Edison">Southern California Edison</a> (SCE) to examine the future of <a href="/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid" title="Plug-in hybrid">plug-in hybrids</a> in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid" title="Ford Escape Hybrid">Ford Escape Hybrids</a> into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated "in typical customer settings", according to Ford.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/William_Clay_Ford_Jr." title="William Clay Ford Jr.">William Clay Ford Jr.</a>, great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname "Bill"), was appointed Executive Chairman in 1998, and also became Chief Executive Officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Nasser" title="Jacques Nasser">Jacques Nasser</a>, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ford_II" title="Henry Ford II">Henry Ford II</a>, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company <a href="/wiki/Cosworth" title="Cosworth">Cosworth</a> to <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Forsythe" title="Gerald Forsythe">Gerald Forsythe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Kalkhoven" title="Kevin Kalkhoven">Kevin Kalkhoven</a> in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of President and Chief Operation Officer <a href="/wiki/Jim_Padilla" title="Jim Padilla">Jim Padilla</a> in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named <a href="/wiki/Alan_Mulally" title="Alan Mulally">Alan Mulally</a> as President and CEO, with Ford continuing as Executive Chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25 billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral. Chairman Bill Ford has stated that "bankruptcy is not an option". Ford and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Auto_Workers" title="United Auto Workers">United Auto Workers</a>, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run <a href="/wiki/Voluntary_Employee_Beneficiary_Association" title="Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association">Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association</a> (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at approximately <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$5.5 billion</span> as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$500 million</span> of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.</p>
<p>The automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7 billion, and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009. However, Ford surprised <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750 million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7 billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volvo_cars" title="Volvo cars">Volvo</a>.</p>
<p>On June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to <a href="/wiki/Tata_Motors" title="Tata Motors">Tata Motors</a> for $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>During congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., and in a show of support, Ford's Alan Mulally stated that "We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions". Mulally went on to state that "The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford" and that Ford Motor Company's supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%932012_global_financial_crisis" title="2007–2012 global financial crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>. Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that "In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company"  GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/T.A.R.P." title="T.A.R.P.">T.A.R.P.</a> legislation funding provisions.</p>
<p>On December 19, the cost of <a href="/wiki/Credit_default_swap" title="Credit default swap">credit default swaps</a> to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent the sum insured for five years in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8 million paid upfront to insure $10 million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year. In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6 billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt for equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position. These actions yielded Ford a $2.7 billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.</p>
<p>In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price.</p>
<p>On November 1, 2012, Ford announced that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CEO" title="CEO">CEO</a> <a href="/wiki/Alan_Mulally" title="Alan Mulally">Alan Mulally</a> will stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named <a href="/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)" title="Mark Fields (businessman)">Mark Fields</a>, the president of operations in Americas, as its new chief operating officer  Ford's CEO Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.</p>

<p>In 2010, Ford earned a net profit of $6.6 billion and reduced its debt from $33.6 billion to $14.5 billion lowering interest payments by $1 billion following its 2009 net profit of $2.7 billion. In the U.S., the F-Series was the best-selling vehicle for 2010. Ford sold 528,349 F-Series trucks during the year, a 27.7% increase over 2009, out of a total sales of 1.9 million vehicles, or every one out of four vehicles Ford sold. Trucks sales accounts for a big slice of Ford's profits, according to USA Today. Ford's realignment also included the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, <a href="/wiki/The_Hertz_Corporation" title="The Hertz Corporation">Hertz Rent-a-Car</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Private_equity" title="Private equity">private equity</a> group for $15 billion in cash and debt acquisition. The sale was completed on December 22, 2005. A 50–50 joint venture with <a href="/wiki/Mahindra_%26_Mahindra" title="Mahindra &amp; Mahindra">Mahindra &amp; Mahindra</a> of India, called <a href="/wiki/Ford_India_Private_Limited" title="Ford India Private Limited">Mahindra Ford India, Limited</a> (MIFL), ended with Ford buying out Mahindra's remaining stake in the company in 2005.

<p>In the first five months of 2010, auto sales in the U.S. rose to 4.6 million cars and light trucks, an increase of 17% from a year earlier. The rise was mainly caused by the return of commercial customers that had all but stopped buying in 2009 during the recession. Sales to individual customers at dealerships have increased 13%, while fleet sales have jumped 32%. Ford reported that 37% of its sales in May came from fleet sales when it announced its sales for the month increased 23%. In the first seven months of 2010, vehicle sales of Ford increased 24%, including retail and fleet sales. Fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%. Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.</p>

<p>At first, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Germany" title="Ford Germany">Ford in Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_of_Britain" title="Ford of Britain">Ford in Britain</a> built different models from one another until the late 1960s, with the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Escort_(Europe)" title="Ford Escort (Europe)">Ford Escort</a> and then the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Capri" title="Ford Capri">Ford Capri</a> being common to both companies. Later on, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Taunus" title="Ford Taunus">Ford Taunus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Cortina" title="Ford Cortina">Ford Cortina</a> became identical, produced in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Left_hand_drive" title="Left hand drive">left hand drive</a> and right hand drive respectively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The <a href="/wiki/Ford_Sierra" title="Ford Sierra">Ford Sierra</a> replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the "Jellymould" and "The Salesman's Spaceship."</p>
<p>In February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Transit" title="Ford Transit">Transit</a> van continued at the company's <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> facility until mid-2013, engines at <a href="/wiki/Bridgend" title="Bridgend">Bridgend</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Dagenham" title="Ford Dagenham">Dagenham</a>, and transmissions at <a href="/wiki/Halewood" title="Halewood">Halewood</a>.

<p>Ford also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Otosan" title="Otosan">Ford Otosan</a>, established in the 1970s, manufactures the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Transit_Connect" title="Ford Transit Connect">Transit Connect</a> compact panel van as well as the "Jumbo" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near <a href="/wiki/%C4%B0zmit" title="İzmit">Kocaeli</a> in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.</p>
<p>Another joint venture plant near <a href="/wiki/Set%C3%BAbal" title="Setúbal">Setúbal</a> in Portugal, set up in collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>, formerly assembled the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Galaxy" title="Ford Galaxy">Galaxy</a> people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Sharan" title="Volkswagen Sharan">VW Sharan</a> and <a href="/wiki/SEAT_Alhambra" title="SEAT Alhambra">SEAT Alhambra</a>. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Setúbal facility.</p>
<p>In 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in <a href="/wiki/Automobile_Craiova" title="Automobile Craiova">Automobile Craiova</a>, Romania. Starting 2009, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Transit_Connect" title="Ford Transit Connect">Ford Transit Connect</a> was Ford's first model produced in <a href="/wiki/Craiova" title="Craiova">Craiova</a>, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_B-Max" title="Ford B-Max">B-Max</a>.</p>
<p>Its 1959 <a href="/wiki/Ford_Anglia" title="Ford Anglia">Anglia</a> two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical <a href="/wiki/Ford_Escort_(Europe)" title="Ford Escort (Europe)">Escort</a> in 1967.</p>
<p>The third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel drive saloons to front-wheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.</p>
<p>The fourth generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor – the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Focus_(international)" title="Ford Focus (international)">Focus</a> – had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale, and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation Focus at the end of 2004.</p>
<p>The 1982 <a href="/wiki/Ford_Sierra" title="Ford Sierra">Ford Sierra</a> – replacement for the long-running and massively popular <a href="/wiki/Ford_Cortina" title="Ford Cortina">Cortina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Taunus" title="Ford Taunus">Taunus</a> models – was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel drive <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mondeo" title="Ford Mondeo">Mondeo</a> at the start of 1993.</p>
<p>The rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fiesta" title="Ford Fiesta">Fiesta</a> hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valencia,_Spain" title="Valencia, Spain">Valencia</a> in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would be closing its <a href="/wiki/Genk" title="Genk">Genk</a> assembly plant in eastern <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> by the end of 2014.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="East_and_Southeast_Asia">East and Southeast Asia</span></h3>
<p>Ford formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013 $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one. Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, Singapore, Hong Kong, the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, where Ford has had a joint venture with <a href="/wiki/Ford_Lio_Ho_Motor" title="Ford Lio Ho Motor">Lio Ho</a> since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in <a href="/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995, when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance. Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in <a href="/wiki/Chonburi_(city)" title="Chonburi (city)">Chonburi</a>, the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory built in 1941 in Singapore was shortly taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the <a href="/wiki/Old_Ford_Motor_Factory" title="Old Ford Motor Factory">factory site</a> which is now a national monument in Singapore. On April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in <a href="/wiki/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of <a href="/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls" title="Foreign exchange controls">shadow currency</a>, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ford_of_Korea">Ford of Korea</span></h4>
<p>In 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company <a href="/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company" title="Hyundai Motor Company">Hyundai</a> and at the new factory in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ulsan,_South_Korea" title="Ulsan, South Korea">Ulsan, South Korea</a> built the European <a href="/wiki/Ford_Cortina" title="Ford Cortina">Ford Cortina</a> until 1974, when Hyundai introduced their all-new <a href="/wiki/Hyundai_Pony" title="Hyundai Pony">Hyundai Pony</a> in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer <a href="/wiki/Kia_Motors" title="Kia Motors">Kia</a> which built vehicles co-engineered with <a href="/wiki/Mazda" title="Mazda">Mazda</a>, later selling the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Festiva" title="Ford Festiva">Ford Festiva</a> from 1988–1993, and the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Festiva" title="Ford Festiva">Ford Aspire</a> from 1994–1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer <a href="/wiki/Mazda" title="Mazda">Mazda</a> in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's <a href="/wiki/Mazda_Familia" title="Mazda Familia">Familia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mazda_Capella" title="Mazda Capella">Capella</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Laser" title="Ford Laser">Ford Laser</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Telstar" title="Ford Telstar">Telstar</a> throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asian_financial_crisis" title="Asian financial crisis">Asian financial crisis</a>. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; and in 1998, <a href="/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company" title="Hyundai Motor Company">Hyundai Motor Company</a> acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986. After subsequent divestments, Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.</p>
<p>Ford currently sells the Focus and Mondeo with diesel engines, plus the Mustang, Taurus, Escape, and Explorer, as well as the Lincoln MKS, MKZ, and MKC.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="South_and_West_Asia">South and West Asia</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ford_India_Private_Limited" title="Ford India Private Limited">Ford India</a> began production in 1998 at <a href="/wiki/Chennai" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced <a href="/wiki/Ford_Ikon" title="Ford Ikon">Ford Ikon</a> in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.</p>
<p>On March 9, 2010, Ford Motor Co. launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at <a href="/wiki/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee">₹</a>349,900, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Figo" title="Ford Figo">Figo</a> was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market. On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of <a href="/wiki/Gujarat" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in <a href="/wiki/Sanand" title="Sanand">Sanand</a>, and planned to invest approximately <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$1 billion</span> on a 460-acre site.</p>
<p>Ford's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region. <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Kuwait, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in 1926, but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment. Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford/Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were <a href="/wiki/Ford_Crown_Victoria" title="Ford Crown Victoria">Ford Crown Victorias</a>. In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" title="General Motors">General Motors</a>' 88,852 units and <a href="/wiki/Nissan" title="Nissan">Nissan Motors</a>' 75,000 units.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="South_America">South America</span></h3>
<p>During much of the 20th century, Ford faced protectionist government measures in South America, with the result that it built different models in different countries, without particular regard to rationalization or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economy_of_scale" title="Economy of scale">economy of scale</a> inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations. In many cases, new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with, or whose factories it had acquired. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Corcel" title="Ford Corcel">Corcel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Del_Rey" title="Ford Del Rey">Del Rey</a> in Brazil were originally based on <a href="/wiki/Renault" title="Renault">Renault</a> vehicles.</p>
<p>In 1987, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_do_Brasil" title="Ford do Brasil">Ford of Brazil</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company_of_Argentina" title="Ford Motor Company of Argentina">Ford of Argentina</a> merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Group" title="Volkswagen Group">Volkswagen Group</a>, forming a new joint-venture company called <a href="/wiki/Autolatina" title="Autolatina">Autolatina</a> with a shared model range. Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. With the advent of <a href="/wiki/Mercosur" title="Mercosur">Mercosur</a>, the regional common market, Ford was finally able to rationalize its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fiesta" title="Ford Fiesta">Ford Fiesta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_EcoSport" title="Ford EcoSport">Ford EcoSport</a> are only built in Brazil, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Focus_(international)" title="Ford Focus (international)">Ford Focus</a> only built in <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mondeo" title="Ford Mondeo">Ford Mondeo</a> from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Courier" title="Ford Courier">Courier</a>, which is also produced in South Africa as the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Bantam" title="Ford Bantam">Ford Bantam</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Driving_on_the_left_or_right" title="Driving on the left or right">right hand drive</a> versions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Africa">Africa</span></h3>
<p>In Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its Port Elizabeth facility. Later Ford sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a <a href="/wiki/Ford_P100" title="Ford P100">Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up</a>, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by <a href="/wiki/Anglo_American_plc" title="Anglo American plc">Anglo American</a>, to form the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/South_African_Motor_Corporation" title="South African Motor Corporation">South African Motor Corporation</a> (<a href="/wiki/Samcor" title="Samcor">Samcor</a>).</p>
<p>Following international condemnation of <a href="/wiki/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company. Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up, and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Mazda" title="Mazda">Mazda</a>-based Laser and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Telstar" title="Ford Telstar">Telstar</a>. Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in <a href="/wiki/Samcor" title="Samcor">Samcor</a> following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003, while the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo has since been reintroduced, but badged as the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fusion_(Americas)" title="Ford Fusion (Americas)">Fusion</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ford_of_Japan">Ford of Japan</span></h4>
<p>Ford established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported <a href="/wiki/Knock-down_kit" title="Knock-down kit">knock-down kits</a>. The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>After World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958, when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a <a href="/wiki/List_of_Mazda_facilities#R.26D" title="List of Mazda facilities">research and development location</a> for Ford partner <a href="/wiki/Mazda" title="Mazda">Mazda</a>. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982 Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called <i><a class="extiw" href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%9E" title="ja:オートラマ">Autorama</a> (Japanese)</i>. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.</p>
<p>Vehicles sold at <i>Autorama</i> locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989–1998), Mustang, Taurus (1989–1997), Thunderbird (1990–1993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mondeo" title="Ford Mondeo">Ford Mondeo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Ka" title="Ford Ka">Ka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Focus" title="Ford Focus">Focus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_C-Max" title="Ford C-Max">Focus C-MAX</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fiesta" title="Ford Fiesta">Fiesta</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Galaxy" title="Ford Galaxy">Galaxy</a>. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations.

<p>Ford increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July 2016 it is listed at 11%. Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October 2010, the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), <a href="/wiki/Ford_Kuga" title="Ford Kuga">Ford Kuga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Navigator" title="Lincoln Navigator">Lincoln Navigator</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_MKX" title="Lincoln MKX">Lincoln MKX</a>, and more recently the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Ecosport" title="Ford Ecosport">Ford Ecosport</a> were available in Japan.

<p>In Australia and New Zealand, the popular <a href="/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(Australia)" title="Ford Falcon (Australia)">Ford Falcon</a> (1960-2016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" title="General Motors">General Motors</a> rival, the <a href="/wiki/Holden_Commodore" title="Holden Commodore">Holden Commodore</a>, the Falcon used a rear wheel drive layout. High performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362 hp (270 kW). A <a href="/wiki/Coup%C3%A9_utility" title="Coupé utility">ute</a> (short for "utility", known in the US as <a href="/wiki/Pickup_truck" title="Pickup truck">pickup truck</a>) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sells highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and <a href="/wiki/Pickup_truck" title="Pickup truck">utes</a> through its performance car division, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Performance_Vehicles" title="Ford Performance Vehicles">Ford Performance Vehicles</a> until it closed in 2014.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and comprise over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%. More recently Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup– the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant may be shut down from 2013 which it did in 2016. They have also announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, nothing came of that plan.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Laser was one of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company_of_Australia" title="Ford Motor Company of Australia">Ford Australia</a>'s most successful models, and was manufactured in Ford's <a href="/wiki/Homebush,_New_South_Wales" title="Homebush, New South Wales">Homebush</a> plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it, because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in <a href="/wiki/Wiri" title="Wiri">Wiri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Auckland" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Ford_Sierra" title="Ford Sierra">Sierra</a> wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of <a href="/wiki/Station_wagon" title="Station wagon">station wagons</a> in that market.</p>
<p>The scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers—over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows—who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Fords plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Buses">Buses</span></h3>

<p>Ford manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a <a href="/wiki/Second_stage_manufacturer" title="Second stage manufacturer">second stage manufacturer</a>. In North America, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_E-Series" title="Ford E-Series">E-Series</a> is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the <a href="/wiki/Ford_F-650" title="Ford F-650">F-650</a> is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty <a href="/wiki/Ford_B-Series" title="Ford B-Series">B700</a> was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Built_Buses" title="Thomas Built Buses">Thomas Built</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ward_Body_Works" title="Ward Body Works">Ward</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blue_Bird_Corporation" title="Blue Bird Corporation">Blue Bird</a>, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers. Older bus models included:</p>
<p>Prior to 1936, Ford buses were based on truck bodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model B – 1930s</li>
<li>Model T – 1920s</li>
<li>F-105 school bus</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1936, Ford introduced the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Transit_Bus" title="Ford Transit Bus">Ford Transit Bus</a>, a series of small transit buses with bodies built by a second party. Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947 (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).</p>
<p>Rear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>09-B/19-B City transit bus – 1939–1941</li>
<li>19-B/29-B City transit bus – 1941–1942</li>
<li>49-B/79-B City transit bus – 1944–1947</li>
<li>69-B City transit bus – 1946–1947</li>
<li>29-B City transit bus – 1946–1947</li>
<li>72-T transit bus – 1944–1945</li>
</ul>
<p>After 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the <i>Universal Bus</i> with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:</p>
<ul>
<li>79-B Universal transit bus – 1946–1947</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Following World War II and from 1950s onwards Ford lost out to <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" title="General Motors">General Motors</a>. This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.</p>

<p>In 2004 Ford and Toyota agreed a patent sharing accord which granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange Ford licensed Toyota some of its own patents. In 2004 Ford introduced the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid" title="Ford Escape Hybrid">Escape Hybrid</a>. With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle" title="Hybrid vehicle">hybrid electric vehicle</a> and the first hybrid electric <a href="/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" title="Sport utility vehicle">SUV</a> to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flexible_fuel" title="Flexible fuel">flexible fuel</a> capability to run on <a href="/wiki/E85" title="E85">E85</a>. The Escape's platform mate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mercury_Mariner" title="Mercury Mariner">Mercury Mariner</a> was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year—a full year ahead of schedule. The similar <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mazda_Tribute" title="Mazda Tribute">Mazda Tribute</a> will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.</p>
<p>In 2005 Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components. Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.</p>
<p>In September 2007 Ford announced a partnership with <a href="/wiki/Southern_California_Edison" title="Southern California Edison">Southern California Edison</a> (SCE) to examine how <a href="/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid" title="Plug-in hybrid">plug-in hybrids</a> will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid" title="Ford Escape Hybrid">Ford Escape Hybrids</a> into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated "in typical customer settings", according to Ford.</p>
<p>On June 12, 2008 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USDOE" title="USDOE">USDOE</a> expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13 hp) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lithium-ion" title="Lithium-ion">lithium-ion</a> battery supplied by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Johnson_Controls-Saft" title="Johnson Controls-Saft">Johnson Controls-Saft</a> that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48 km) at speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h). In March 2009 Ford launched hybrid versions of the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fusion_Hybrid" title="Ford Fusion Hybrid">Ford Fusion Hybrid</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mercury_Milan_Hybrid" title="Mercury Milan Hybrid">Mercury Milan Hybrid</a> in the United States, both as 2010 models.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Increased_fuel_efficiency">Increased fuel efficiency</span></h3>
<p>Ford Motor Company announced it will accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company will convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, will convert from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford will also introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012.</p>
<p>Ford of Europe developed the <a href="/wiki/ECOnetic" title="ECOnetic">ECOnetic</a> programme to address the market and legislative need for higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. As opposed to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hybrid_engine" title="Hybrid engine">hybrid engine</a> technology used in competitor products such as the <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Prius" title="Toyota Prius">Toyota Prius</a>, ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower consuming <a href="/wiki/Ford_Duratorq_engine" title="Ford Duratorq engine">Duratorq TDCi</a> diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance and improved efficiency, the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fiesta" title="Ford Fiesta">Ford Fiesta</a> is currently the lowest emitting mass-produced car in Europe, while the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Focus_(international)" title="Ford Focus (international)">2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic</a> will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf" title="Volkswagen Golf">Volkswagen Golf</a> <a href="/wiki/BlueMotion" title="BlueMotion">BlueMotion</a>.

<p>Ford has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight and come equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aachen_University" title="Aachen University">Aachen University</a> created the "<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=2015_Ford_Model_T&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="2015 Ford Model T (page does not exist)">2015 Ford Model T</a>".</p>
<p>In 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its light truck fleet – including its popular <a href="/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" title="Sport utility vehicle">SUVs</a> – to be completed by the 2005 <a href="/wiki/Calendar_year" title="Calendar year">calendar year</a>. In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Researchers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> have, however, listed Ford as the seventh-worst corporate producer of air pollution, primarily because of the <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a> compounds, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1,2,4-trimethylbenzene" title="1,2,4-trimethylbenzene">1,2,4-trimethylbenzene</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Glycol_ethers" title="Glycol ethers">glycol ethers</a> released from its <a href="/wiki/Casting_(metalworking)" title="Casting (metalworking)">casting</a>, truck, and assembly plants. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54 <a href="/wiki/Superfund" title="Superfund">Superfund</a> toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.</p>
<p>For the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years.</p>
