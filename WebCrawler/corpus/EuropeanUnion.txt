<p>The <b>European Union</b> (<b>EU</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Political_union" title="Political union">politico</a>-<a href="/wiki/Economic_union" title="Economic union">economic union</a> of <a href="/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union" title="Member state of the European Union">28 member states</a> that are located primarily in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It has an area of 4,324,782 km (1,669,808 sq mi), and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed <a href="/wiki/European_Single_Market" title="European Single Market">an internal single market</a> through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the <a href="/wiki/Single_market" title="Single market">free movement of people, goods, services, and capital</a> within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">agriculture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Common_Fisheries_Policy" title="Common Fisheries Policy">fisheries</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Regional_policy_of_the_European_Union" title="Regional policy of the European Union">regional development</a>. Within the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Area" title="Schengen Area">Schengen Area</a>, <a href="/wiki/Passport" title="Passport">passport</a> controls have been abolished. <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" title="Eurozone">A monetary union</a> was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" title="Eurozone">19 EU member states</a> which use the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> currency.</p>
<p>The EU operates through a hybrid system of <a href="/wiki/Supranational_union" title="Supranational union">supranational</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmentalism" title="Intergovernmentalism">intergovernmental</a> decision-making. The seven principal decision-making bodies—known as the <a href="/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union" title="Institutions of the European Union">institutions of the European Union</a>—are the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union" title="Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Central_Bank" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Auditors" title="European Court of Auditors">European Court of Auditors</a>.</p>
<p>The EU traces its origins from the <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="European Coal and Steel Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a> (ECSC) and the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC), formed by the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Six" title="Inner Six">Inner Six</a> countries in 1951 and 1958, respectively. The community and its successors have grown in size by <a href="/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="Enlargement of the European Union">the accession of new member states</a> and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> established the European Union in 1993 and introduced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_citizenship" title="European citizenship">European citizenship</a>. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a>, came into force in 2009.</p>
<p>Covering 7.3% of the world population, the EU in 2016 generated a nominal <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) of 16.477 trillion US dollars, constituting approximately 22.2% of global <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nominal_GDP" title="Nominal GDP">nominal GDP</a> and 16.9% when measured in terms of <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a>.

In 2012, the EU was awarded the <a href="/wiki/2012_Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="2012 Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. Through the <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a>, the EU has developed a role in <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_the_European_Union" title="Foreign relations of the European Union">external relations</a> and <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union" title="Military of the European Union">defence</a>. The union maintains permanent <a href="/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_European_Union" title="List of diplomatic missions of the European Union">diplomatic missions</a> throughout the world and represents itself at the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_and_the_United_Nations" title="European Union and the United Nations">United Nations</a>, the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Union_and_the_G8" title="European Union and the G8">G8</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/G-20" title="G-20">G-20</a>.

<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent. The 1948 <a href="/wiki/Hague_Congress_(1948)" title="Hague Congress (1948)">Hague Congress</a> was a pivotal moment in European federal history, as it led to the creation of the <a href="/wiki/European_Movement_International" title="European Movement International">European Movement International</a> and of the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Europe" title="College of Europe">College of Europe</a>, where Europe's future leaders would live and study together. 1952 saw the creation of the <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="European Coal and Steel Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a>, which was declared to be "a first step in the federation of Europe." The supporters of the Community included <a href="/wiki/Alcide_De_Gasperi" title="Alcide De Gasperi">Alcide De Gasperi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jean_Monnet" title="Jean Monnet">Jean Monnet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Schuman" title="Robert Schuman">Robert Schuman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paul-Henri_Spaak" title="Paul-Henri Spaak">Paul-Henri Spaak</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Treaty_of_Rome_.281957.E2.80.9392.29">Treaty of Rome (1957–92)</span></h3>

<p>In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> signed the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome" title="Treaty of Rome">Treaty of Rome</a>, which created the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC) and established a <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union" title="European Union Customs Union">customs union</a>. They also signed another pact creating the <a href="/wiki/European_Atomic_Energy_Community" title="European Atomic Energy Community">European Atomic Energy Community</a> (Euratom) for co-operation in developing <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear energy</a>. Both treaties came into force in 1958.</p>
<p>The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by <a href="/wiki/Walter_Hallstein" title="Walter Hallstein">Walter Hallstein</a> (<a href="/wiki/Hallstein_Commission" title="Hallstein Commission">Hallstein Commission</a>) and Euratom was headed by <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armand" title="Louis Armand">Louis Armand</a> (<a href="/wiki/Armand_Commission" title="Armand Commission">Armand Commission</a>) and then <a href="/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Hirsch" title="Étienne Hirsch">Étienne Hirsch</a>. Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members.</p>
<p>Through the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the <a href="/wiki/Merger_Treaty" title="Merger Treaty">Merger Treaty</a> created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the <i><a href="/wiki/European_Communities" title="European Communities">European Communities</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Jean_Rey_(politician)" title="Jean Rey (politician)">Jean Rey</a> <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission" title="President of the European Commission">presided over</a> the first merged Commission (<a href="/wiki/Rey_Commission" title="Rey Commission">Rey Commission</a>).</p>

<p>In 1973, the Communities enlarged to include <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> (including <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, which later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenlandic_European_Economic_Community_membership_referendum,_1982" title="Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum, 1982">left the Community</a> in 1985, following a dispute over fishing rights), <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1972" title="Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972">referendum</a>. In 1979, the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1979" title="European Parliament election, 1979">first direct elections</a> to the European Parliament were held.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> joined in 1981, <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> following in 1986. In 1985, the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" title="Schengen Agreement">Schengen Agreement</a> paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states. In 1986, the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Europe" title="Flag of Europe">European flag</a> began to be used by the Community and the <a href="/wiki/Single_European_Act" title="Single European Act">Single European Act</a> was signed.</p>
<p>In 1990, after <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989" title="Revolutions of 1989">the fall of the Eastern Bloc</a>, the former <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a> became part of the Community as part of a <a href="/wiki/German_reunification" title="German reunification">reunified Germany</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Maastricht_Treaty_.281992.E2.80.932007.29">Maastricht Treaty (1992–2007)</span></h3>

<p>The European Union was formally established when the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>—whose main architects were <a href="/wiki/Helmut_Kohl" title="Helmut Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand" title="François Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>—came into force on 1 November 1993. The treaty also gave the name <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Community" title="European Community">European Community</a> to the EEC, even if it was referred as such before the treaty. In 1995, <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> joined the EU.</p>
<p>In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" title="Eurozone">eurozone</a> has increased to encompass 19 countries. The euro currency became the second largest reserve currency in the world. In 2004, the EU saw <a href="/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="2004 enlargement of the European Union">its biggest enlargement to date</a> when <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Estonia" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latvia" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slovakia" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> joined the Union.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lisbon_Treaty_.282007.E2.80.93present.29">Lisbon Treaty (2007–present)</span></h3>

<p>In 2007, <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> became EU members. The same year, <a href="/wiki/Slovenian_euro_coins" title="Slovenian euro coins">Slovenia</a> adopted the euro, followed in 2008 by <a href="/wiki/Cypriot_euro_coins" title="Cypriot euro coins">Cyprus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maltese_euro_coins" title="Maltese euro coins">Malta</a>, by <a href="/wiki/Slovak_euro_coins" title="Slovak euro coins">Slovakia</a> in 2009, by <a href="/wiki/Estonian_euro_coins" title="Estonian euro coins">Estonia</a> in 2011, by <a href="/wiki/Latvian_euro_coins" title="Latvian euro coins">Latvia</a> in 2014 and by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lithuania_euro_coins" title="Lithuania euro coins">Lithuania</a> in 2015.</p>

<p>On 1 December 2009, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Lisbon Treaty</a> entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the <a href="/wiki/Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union" title="Three pillars of the European Union">EU three pillars</a> system into a single legal entity provisioned with a <a href="/wiki/Legal_personality" title="Legal personality">legal personality</a>, created a permanent <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council" title="President of the European Council">President of the European Council</a>, the first of which was <a href="/wiki/Herman_Van_Rompuy" title="Herman Van Rompuy">Herman Van Rompuy</a>, and strengthened the position of the <a href="/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy" title="High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2012, the EU received the <a href="/wiki/2012_Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="2012 Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for having "<i>contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe.</i>" In 2013, <a href="/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> became the 28th EU member.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the 2010s, the European Union has been going through a series of tests, including <a href="/wiki/European_debt_crisis" title="European debt crisis">a debt crisis in some of the Eurozone countries</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_migrant_crisis" title="European migrant crisis">increasing migration from the Middle East</a> and the possible <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union" title="United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union">United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU</a>.

<p>The EU's member states cover an area of 4,423,147 square kilometres (1,707,787 sq mi). The EU's highest peak is <a href="/wiki/Mont_Blanc" title="Mont Blanc">Mont Blanc</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Graian_Alps" title="Graian Alps">Graian Alps</a>, 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">above sea level</a>.

The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006 mi) long.</p>
<p>Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification" title="Köppen climate classification">types of climate</a> from <a href="/wiki/Polar_climate" title="Polar climate">Arctic</a> (North-East Europe) to tropical (<a href="/wiki/French_Guiana" title="French Guiana">French Guiana</a>), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_climate" title="Oceanic climate">maritime climate</a> (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_climate" title="Mediterranean climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or <a href="/wiki/Hemiboreal" title="Hemiboreal">hemiboreal</a> climate (Northern <a href="/wiki/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> and Central Europe).</p>
<p>The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in seven member states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a <a href="/wiki/Blue_Banana" title="Blue Banana">large grouping</a> in and around the <a href="/wiki/Benelux" title="Benelux">Benelux</a>. An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases, this urban growth has been due to the influx of <a href="/wiki/Trans-European_Networks" title="Trans-European Networks">EU funds</a> into a region.</p>

<p>Through successive <a href="/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="Enlargement of the European Union">enlargements</a>, the European Union has grown from the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Six" title="Inner Six">six founding states</a>—Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—to the current 28. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">treaties</a>, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".</p>
<p>To become a member, a country must meet the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria" title="Copenhagen criteria">Copenhagen criteria</a>, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>; a functioning <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market economy</a>; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council. No member state has yet left the Union, although <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> (an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autonomous_area" title="Autonomous area">autonomous province</a> of Denmark) withdrew in 1985. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Lisbon Treaty</a> now contains a clause under Article 50, providing for a member to leave the EU. On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted by referendum to leave the EU. However, it remains a member until it officially exits, and has not yet begun formal withdrawal procedures.</p>
<p>There are six countries that are recognised as <a href="/wiki/Future_enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="Future enlargement of the European Union">candidates for membership</a>: <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Albania_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Albania to the European Union">Albania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Iceland_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Iceland to the European Union">Iceland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Macedonia_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Macedonia to the European Union">Macedonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Montenegro_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Montenegro to the European Union">Montenegro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Serbia_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Serbia to the European Union">Serbia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Turkey to the European Union">Turkey</a>, though Iceland suspended negotiations in 2013. <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Kosovo_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Kosovo to the European Union">Kosovo</a> are officially recognised as potential candidates, with Bosnia and Herzegovina having submitted a membership application.</p>

<p>In 1957, when the EEC was founded, it had no environmental policy. Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards and biotechnology. According to the <a href="/wiki/Institute_for_European_Environmental_Policy" title="Institute for European Environmental Policy">Institute for European Environmental Policy</a>, environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.</p>
<p>European policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem. <a href="/wiki/Trade_barrier" title="Trade barrier">Trade barriers</a> and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state. In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.</p>

<p>Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> despite opposition from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions. EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.</p>
<p>Mitigating <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in future, 20% of the energy used across the EU must be <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable</a>, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels. The EU has adopted an <a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">emissions trading system</a> to incorporate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> into the economy. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Green_Capital" title="European Green Capital">European Green Capital</a> is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency and quality of life in urban areas to create <a href="/wiki/Smart_city" title="Smart city">smart city</a>.</p>

<p>The European Union operates according to the principles of <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_conferral" title="Principle of conferral">conferral</a> (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">treaties</a>) and of <a href="/wiki/Subsidiarity#European_Union_law" title="Subsidiarity">subsidiarity</a> (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). <a href="/wiki/European_Union_law" title="European Union law">Laws made by the EU institutions</a> are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).</p>

<p>The classification of the EU in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated. It began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a <a href="/wiki/Confederation" title="Confederation">confederation</a> of states. However, since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">federation</a>, such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government, without becoming a federation <i>per se</i>. Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation, being an instance of neither political structure. For this reason, the organisation is termed <i><a href="/wiki/Sui_generis" title="Sui generis">sui generis</a></i> (incomparable, one of a kind), although some argue that this designation is no longer valid.</p>
<p>The organisation has traditionally used the terms "Community" and later "Union" to describe itself. The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations). They can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions. Especially in terms of the European tradition, the term federation is equated with a sovereign <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Federal_state" title="Federal state">federal state</a> in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least, not without qualification. It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a <a href="/wiki/Federalism" title="Federalism">federal union of states</a>, a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state. The German Constitutional Court refers to the EU as a <i><a href="/wiki/Staatenverbund" title="Staatenverbund">Staatenverbund</a></i>, an intermediate structure between the <i>Staatenbund</i> (confederation of states) and the <i>Bundesstaat</i> (federal state), consistent with this concept. This may be a long-lived political form. Professor Andrew Moravcsik claims that the EU is unlikely to develop further into a federal state, but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="European_Council">European Council</span></h4>

<p>The European Council gives political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council" title="President of the European Council">President of the European Council</a> (currently <a href="/wiki/Donald_Tusk" title="Donald Tusk">Donald Tusk</a>), the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission" title="President of the European Commission">President of the European Commission</a> and one representative per <a href="/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union" title="Member state of the European Union">member state</a> (either its <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">head of state</a> or <a href="/wiki/Head_of_government" title="Head of government">head of government</a>).

It has been described by some as the Union's "supreme political authority". It is actively involved in the negotiation of <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">treaty changes</a> and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.</p>
<p>The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a "<a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">collective head of state</a>" and <a href="/wiki/Ratification" title="Ratification">ratifies</a> important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).</p>
<p>Tasks for the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council" title="President of the European Council">President of the European Council</a> are ensuring the external representation of the EU, driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them.</p>
<p>The European Council should not be mistaken for the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Europe" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a>, an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</a> (also called the "Council" and the "Council of Ministers", its former title) forms one half of the EU's legislature.

Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to <a href="/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Political groups of the European Parliament">political groups</a> rather than their nationality.

<p>The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ordinary_legislative_procedure" title="Ordinary legislative procedure">ordinary legislative procedure</a>. This also applies to the <a href="/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union" title="Budget of the European Union">EU budget</a>.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union" title="Budget of the European Union">Budget of the European Union</a></div>

<p>The EU had an agreed budget of €120.7 billion for the year 2007 and €864.3 billion for the period 2007–2013, representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's <a href="/wiki/Gross_national_income" title="Gross national income">GNI</a> forecast for the respective periods. By comparison, the United Kingdom's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759 billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801 billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP.</p>
<p>In the 2010 budget of €141.5 billion, the largest single expenditure item is "<i><a href="/wiki/Structural_Funds_and_Cohesion_Fund" title="Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">cohesion &amp; competitiveness</a></i>" with around 45% of the total budget. Next comes "<i><a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">agriculture</a></i>" with approximately 31% of the total. "<i>Rural development, environment and <a href="/wiki/Common_Fisheries_Policy" title="Common Fisheries Policy">fisheries</a></i>" takes up around 11%. "<i>Administration</i>" accounts for around 6%. The "<i>EU as a global partner</i>" and "<i>citizenship, freedom, security and justice</i>" bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Court_of_Auditors" title="Court of Auditors">Court of Auditors</a> is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with "a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions". The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget.</p>
<p>The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level. In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">agriculture</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Structural_Funds_and_Cohesion_Fund" title="Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">cohesion fund</a>, were materially affected by error. The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was €1,863 million.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Competences">Competences</span></h3>
<p>EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.</p>
<p>That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legislature_of_the_European_Union" title="Legislature of the European Union">legislative procedure</a> is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.</p>
<p>The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_system">Legal system</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/European_Union_law" title="European Union law">European Union law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">Treaties of the European Union</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a></div>

<p>The EU is based on a series of <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">treaties</a>. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties. These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants. The EU has <a href="/wiki/Legal_personality" title="Legal personality">legal personality</a>, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.</p>
<p>Under the principle of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supremacy_(European_Union_law)" title="Supremacy (European Union law)">supremacy</a>, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Courts_of_Justice">Courts of Justice</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Judiciary" title="Judiciary">judicial branch</a> of the EU—formally called the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union" title="Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>—consists of three courts: the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">Court of Justice</a>, the <a href="/wiki/General_Court_(European_Union)" title="General Court (European Union)">General Court</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Civil_Service_Tribunal" title="European Union Civil Service Tribunal">European Union Civil Service Tribunal</a>. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and <a href="/wiki/Preliminary_ruling" title="Preliminary ruling">cases referred to it</a> by the courts of member states. The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and <a href="/wiki/European_Civil_Service" title="European Civil Service">its civil service</a>. Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fundamental_rights">Fundamental rights</span></h3>

<p>The treaties declare that the EU itself is "founded on the values of respect for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_dignity" title="Human dignity">human dignity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">freedom</a>, democracy, <a href="/wiki/Equality_before_the_law" title="Equality before the law">equality</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to <a href="/wiki/Minority_group" title="Minority group">minorities</a> ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."</p>
<p>In 2009 the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> gave legal effect to the <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>. The charter is a codified catalogue of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fundamental_right" title="Fundamental right">fundamental rights</a> against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states." The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Although signing the <a href="/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership, previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede. The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.</p>
<p>Although, the EU is independent from Council of Europe, they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further <a href="/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Social_Charter" title="European Social Charter">European Social Charter</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Source_of_law" title="Source of law">source of law</a> of <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a> are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acts">Acts</span></h3>
<p>The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: <a href="/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)" title="Regulation (European Union)">regulations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)" title="Directive (European Union)">directives</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Decision_(European_Union)" title="Decision (European Union)">decisions</a>. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures, and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states. When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct_effect" title="Direct effect">direct effect</a> in national law against member states.</p>
<p>Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in <a href="/wiki/Competition_law" title="Competition law">competition law</a>, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Area_of_freedom.2C_security_and_justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice" title="Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</a></div>

<p>Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom, security and justice, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: <a href="/wiki/Europol" title="Europol">Europol</a> for co-operation of police forces, <a href="/wiki/Eurojust" title="Eurojust">Eurojust</a> for co-operation between prosecutors, and <a href="/wiki/Frontex" title="Frontex">Frontex</a> for co-operation between border control authorities. The EU also operates the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Information_System" title="Schengen Information System">Schengen Information System</a> which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" title="Schengen Agreement">Schengen Agreement</a> and the associated cross border crime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as <a href="/wiki/European_Arrest_Warrant" title="European Arrest Warrant">extradition</a>, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice. Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation. By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on <a href="/wiki/Sexism" title="Sexism">sexual discrimination</a> in the work-place, <a href="/wiki/Ageism" title="Ageism">age discrimination</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racial discrimination</a>.</p>

<p>Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common <a href="/wiki/Commercial_policy" title="Commercial policy">Commercial policy</a>. Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of <a href="/wiki/European_Political_Cooperation" title="European Political Cooperation">European Political Cooperation</a> which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the <a href="/wiki/Single_European_Act" title="Single European Act">Single European Act</a>. EPC was renamed as the <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a> (CFSP) by the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>.</p>

<p>The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the <a href="/wiki/International_community" title="International community">international community</a> as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">war in Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the <a href="/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy" title="High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy</a> who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The High Representative heads up the <a href="/wiki/European_External_Action_Service" title="European External Action Service">European External Action Service</a> (EEAS), a unique EU department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a>. The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_corps" title="Diplomatic corps">diplomatic corps</a> for the European Union.</p>
<p>Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through <a href="/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="Enlargement of the European Union">enlargement</a>. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries. This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "<a href="/wiki/Soft_power" title="Soft power">soft power</a>", as opposed to military "hard power".</p>

<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Kosovo_War" title="Kosovo War">Kosovo War</a> in 1999, the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the <a href="/wiki/Helsinki_Headline_Goal" title="Helsinki Headline Goal">Helsinki Headline Goal</a> process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the <a href="/wiki/EU_Battlegroup" title="EU Battlegroup">EU Battlegroups</a> initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel.</p>

In 2012, its budget amounted to €874 million, 51% of the budget went to Africa and 20% to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20% to the Middle East and Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the <a href="/wiki/European_Development_Fund" title="European Development Fund">European Development Fund</a> (30%). The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the <a href="/wiki/Development_Cooperation_Instrument" title="Development Cooperation Instrument">Development Cooperation Instrument</a> (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on <a href="/wiki/Department_for_International_Development" title="Department for International Development">overseas development assistance</a> (ODA), and from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_and_Partnership_Instrument" title="European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument">European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument</a> (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes. The European Development Fund (EDF, €22.7 bn, 2008–2013) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7% target and allow the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> greater oversight.</p>
<p>However, five countries have reached the 0.7% target: Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In 2011, EU aid was 0.42% of the EU's GNI making it the world's most generous aid donor.</p>

<p>Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a <a href="/wiki/Single_market" title="Single market">single market</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union" title="European Union Customs Union">customs union</a> between its member states. The single market involves <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU</a>, and the customs union involves the application of a <a href="/wiki/Common_external_tariff" title="Common external tariff">common external tariff</a> on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or <a href="/wiki/Import_quota" title="Import quota">import quotas</a>, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liechtenstein" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> participate in the single market but not in the customs union. Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.</p>
<p>Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries. Until the drive towards <a href="/wiki/Economic_and_monetary_union" title="Economic and monetary union">economic and monetary union</a> the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.</p>
<p>The free movement of persons means that <a href="/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union" title="Citizenship of the European Union">EU citizens</a> can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.</p>
<p>The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Directive_on_services_in_the_internal_market" title="Directive on services in the internal market">Directive on services in the internal market</a> which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.

<p>The creation of a <a href="/wiki/European_Currency_Unit" title="European Currency Unit">European single currency</a> became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the <a href="/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria" title="Euro convergence criteria">convergence criteria</a> if they wanted to join the <a href="/wiki/Currency_union" title="Currency union">monetary union</a>. The states wanting to participate had first to join the <a href="/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism" title="European Exchange Rate Mechanism">European Exchange Rate Mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_euro" title="History of the euro">eleven member states</a> joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when <a href="/wiki/Euro_banknotes" title="Euro banknotes">euro notes</a> and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.</p>

<p>Since its launch the euro has become the second <a href="/wiki/Reserve_currency" title="Reserve currency">reserve currency</a> in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro. The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the <a href="/wiki/European_Central_Bank" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a> (ECB).</p>
<p>The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls <a href="/wiki/Monetary_policy" title="Monetary policy">monetary policy</a> in that area with an agenda to maintain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Price_stability" title="Price stability">price stability</a>. It is at the centre of the <a href="/wiki/European_System_of_Central_Banks" title="European System of Central Banks">European System of Central Banks</a>, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Central_Bank" title="President of the European Central Bank">President of the ECB</a>, who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_System_of_Financial_Supervision" title="European System of Financial Supervision">European System of Financial Supervision</a> is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the <a href="/wiki/European_Banking_Authority" title="European Banking Authority">European Banking Authority</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Insurance_and_Occupational_Pensions_Authority" title="European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority">European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Securities_and_Markets_Authority" title="European Securities and Markets Authority">European Securities and Markets Authority</a>.

The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.</p>
<p>To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.</p>

<p>In 2006, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Accession_2005" title="Treaty of Accession 2005">EU-27</a> had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported. In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as <a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a> produced in the EU, regardless of the source of the uranium, of which less than 3% is produced in the EU.</p>
<p>The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="European Coal and Steel Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a>. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.</p>
<p>The EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">internal market</a>, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialisation" title="Renewable energy commercialisation">renewable energy commercialisation</a>; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.</p>
<p>The EU imports 82% of its oil, 57% of its natural gas and 97.48% of its uranium demands. Because of <a href="/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector" title="Russia in the European energy sector">Europe's dependence on Russian energy</a> the EU is attempting to diversify its <a href="/wiki/Energy_supply" title="Energy supply">energy supply</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Europe" title="Rail transport in Europe">Rail transport in Europe</a> is being synchronised with the <a href="/wiki/European_Rail_Traffic_Management_System" title="European Rail Traffic Management System">European Rail Traffic Management System</a> (ERTMS), an initiative to greatly enhance safety, increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitised mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.</p>
<p>The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture">Agriculture</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agricultural Policy</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agricultural Policy</a> (CAP) is one of the long lasting policies of the European Community. The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers. It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Community</a>'s annual budget, and as of 2013 accounts for around 34%.</p>
<p>The policy's <a href="/wiki/Incomes_policy" title="Incomes policy">price controls</a> and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were <a href="/wiki/Buffer_stock_scheme" title="Buffer stock scheme">intervention stores</a> of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">developing world</a>. Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Set-aside" title="Set-aside">set-aside</a> in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.</p>

Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language.</p>
<p>The European Parliament provides translation into all languages for documents and its plenary sessions. Some institutions use only a handful of languages as internal working languages. <a href="/wiki/Catalan_language" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galician_language" title="Galician language">Galician</a>, <a href="/wiki/Basque_language" title="Basque language">Basque</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic" title="Scottish Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> are not official languages of the EU but have semi-official status in that official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens of the EU have the right to correspond with the institutions using them.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Language_policy" title="Language policy">Language policy</a> is the responsibility of member states, but EU institutions promote the learning of other languages. English is the most widely spoken language in the EU, being spoken by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers. German is the most widely spoken mother tongue, being spoken by 16% of the EU population. 56% of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue. Most official languages of the EU belong to the <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a> <a href="/wiki/Language_family" title="Language family">language family</a>, except Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, which belong to the <a href="/wiki/Uralic_languages" title="Uralic languages">Uralic</a> language family, and Maltese, which is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semitic_language" title="Semitic language">Semitic language</a>.

<p>Besides the 24 official languages, there are about 150 <a href="/wiki/Regional_language" title="Regional language">regional</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minority_language" title="Minority language">minority languages</a>, spoken by up to 50 million people. Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages, the protection of <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_rights" title="Linguistic rights">linguistic rights</a> is a matter for the individual member states. The <a href="/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages" title="European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a> ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.</p>

<p>The EU is a <a href="/wiki/Secularism" title="Secularism">secular</a> body with no formal connection to any religion. The <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Part_One:_Principles#Article_17" title="s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part One: Principles">Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations".</p>
<p>The preamble to the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Treaty on European Union</a> mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe". Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a> included proposals to mention <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> or <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.</p>
<p>Christians in the EU are divided among members of Catholicism (both <a href="/wiki/Latin_Church" title="Latin Church">Roman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Rite</a>), numerous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> denominations (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anglicans" title="Anglicans">Anglicans</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lutherans" title="Lutherans">Lutherans</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reformed" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> forming the bulk of this category), and the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>. In 2009, the EU had an estimated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Muslim_population" title="List of countries by Muslim population">Muslim population</a> of 13 million, and an estimated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish_population" title="Jewish population">Jewish population</a> of over a million. The other world religions of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sikhism" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> are also represented in the EU population.</p>
<p>According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by <a href="/wiki/Eurobarometer" title="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholics" title="Catholics">Catholics</a> are the largest <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> group, accounting for 48% of the EU population, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestants</a> make up 12%, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Eurostat" title="Eurostat">Eurostat</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Eurobarometer" title="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer</a> opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52% of EU citizens believed in a God, 27% in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18% had no form of belief. Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years. The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the Czech Republic (19%). The most religious countries were Malta (95%, predominantly Roman Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90% of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16 and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale".</p>

<p>Basic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the <a href="/wiki/Erasmus_Programme" title="Erasmus Programme">Erasmus Programme</a>, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.</p>
<p>There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in <a href="/wiki/Vocational_education" title="Vocational education">vocational education and training</a>, and for adult learners in the <a href="/wiki/Lifelong_Learning_Programme_2007%E2%80%932013" title="Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013">Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013</a>. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU. Through its support of the <a href="/wiki/Bologna_Process" title="Bologna Process">Bologna Process</a>, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.</p>
<p>Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's <a href="/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development" title="Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development">Framework Programmes</a>, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent <a href="/wiki/European_Research_Council" title="European Research Council">European Research Council</a> allocates EU funds to European or national research projects. EU <a href="/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development" title="Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development">research and technological framework programmes</a> deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Healthcare_in_Europe" title="Healthcare in Europe">Healthcare in Europe</a></div>

<p>Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> affirms that "A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities". The <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Directorate-General_for_Health_and_Consumers_(European_Commission)" title="Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (European Commission)">Directorate-General for Health and Consumers</a> seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.</p>
<p>Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily <a href="/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care" title="Publicly funded health care">publicly funded</a> through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.</p>
<p>All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free <a href="/wiki/European_Health_Insurance_Card" title="European Health Insurance Card">European Health Insurance Card</a> which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries. A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.</p>

<p>Cultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty. Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the <a href="/wiki/Culture_2000" title="Culture 2000">Culture 2000</a> seven-year programme, the <a href="/wiki/European_Cultural_Month" title="European Cultural Month">European Cultural Month</a> event, and orchestras such as the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Youth_Orchestra" title="European Union Youth Orchestra">European Union Youth Orchestra</a>.</p>

<p>Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the <a href="/wiki/Bosman_ruling" title="Bosman ruling">Bosman ruling</a> that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a> requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity. This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" title="International Olympic Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> and <a href="/wiki/FIFA" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs. The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Association_Football" title="Association Football">Association Football</a> is the most popular sport in almost all EU countries and their club teams are amongst the richest and most popular worldwide.

<p><i><a href="/wiki/Motto_of_the_European_Union" title="Motto of the European Union">United in Diversity</a></i> was adopted as the motto of the Union in the year 2000, having been selected from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A_motto_for_Europe" title="A motto for Europe">proposals</a> submitted by school pupils.

<p>Besides naming the continent, the <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythological</a> figure of <a href="/wiki/Europa_(mythology)" title="Europa (mythology)">Europa</a> has frequently been employed as a <a href="/wiki/National_personification" title="National personification">personification</a> of Europe.
