<p>In <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, <b>extinction</b> is the end of an <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a> or of a group of organisms (<a href="/wiki/Taxon" title="Taxon">taxon</a>), normally a <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the <a href="/wiki/Endling" title="Endling">last individual</a> of the species, although the <a href="/wiki/Functional_extinction" title="Functional extinction">capacity to breed and recover</a> may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential <a href="/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">range</a> may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as <a href="/wiki/Lazarus_taxon" title="Lazarus taxon">Lazarus taxa</a>, where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the <a href="/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil record</a>) after a period of apparent absence.</p>
<p>More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever <a href="/wiki/Life" title="Life">lived</a> on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.</p>
<p>Through <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, species arise through the process of <a href="/wiki/Speciation" title="Speciation">speciation</a>—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an <a href="/wiki/Ecological_niche" title="Ecological niche">ecological niche</a>—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established. A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance, although some species, called <a href="/wiki/Living_fossil" title="Living fossil">living fossils</a>, survive with virtually no <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphological</a> change for hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Extinction_event" title="Extinction event">Mass extinctions</a> are relatively rare events; however, isolated extinctions are quite common. Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the current high rate of extinctions. Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented. Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100.</p>

<p>A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become <a href="/wiki/Functional_extinction" title="Functional extinction">functionally extinct</a> when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in <a href="/wiki/Sexual_reproduction" title="Sexual reproduction">sexually reproducing</a> species), or other reasons.</p>
<p>Pinpointing the extinction (or <a href="/wiki/Pseudoextinction" title="Pseudoextinction">pseudoextinction</a>) of a species requires a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theory_of_species" title="Theory of species">clear definition of that species</a>. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the <a href="/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium" title="Punctuated equilibrium">punctuated equilibrium</a> hypothesis of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould" title="Stephen Jay Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> and <a href="/wiki/Niles_Eldredge" title="Niles Eldredge">Niles Eldredge</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, <i>extinction</i> is often used informally to refer to <a href="/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">local extinction</a>, in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; <a href="/wiki/Wolf_reintroduction" title="Wolf reintroduction">wolf reintroduction</a> is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extant_taxon" title="Extant taxon">extant</a>. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Threatened" title="Threatened">threatened</a> or <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered species</a>.</p>
<p>Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Conservation_status" title="Conservation status">conservation status</a> <a href="/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild" title="Extinct in the wild">"extinct in the wild" (EW)</a>. Species listed under this status by the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in <a href="/wiki/Zoo" title="Zoo">zoos</a> or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild. When possible, modern <a href="/wiki/Zoology" title="Zoology">zoological</a> institutions try to maintain a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viable_population" title="Viable population">viable population</a> for species preservation and possible future <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reintroduction" title="Reintroduction">reintroduction</a> to the wild, through use of carefully planned <a href="/wiki/Breeding_program" title="Breeding program">breeding programs</a>.</p>
<p>The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction". This is especially common with extinction of <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species">keystone species</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pseudoextinction" title="Pseudoextinction">Pseudoextinction</a></div>
<p>Descendants may or may not exist for extinct species. Daughter species that evolve from a parent species carry on most of the parent species' <a href="/wiki/Genotype" title="Genotype">genetic information</a>, and even though the parent species may become extinct, the daughter species lives on. Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction. In other cases, species have produced no new variants, or none that are able to survive the parent species' extinction.</p>
<p>Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct <i><a href="/wiki/Hyracotherium" title="Hyracotherium">Hyracotherium</a></i>, which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern <a href="/wiki/Horse" title="Horse">horse</a>, is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of <i><a href="/wiki/Equus_(genus)" title="Equus (genus)">Equus</a></i>, including <a href="/wiki/Zebra" title="Zebra">zebra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkey</a>. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether <i>Hyracotherium</i> <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse" title="Evolution of the horse">evolved into more modern horse species</a> or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes">Causes</span></h2>

<p>As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average life-span of a species is 1-10 million years, although this varies widely between taxa. There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Stearns" title="Stephen C. Stearns">Stephen C. Stearns</a>, "so is each extinction ... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple". Most simply, any species that cannot <a href="/wiki/Survival_skills" title="Survival skills">survive</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reproduction" title="Reproduction">reproduce</a> in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a> <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> renders its entire <a href="/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as <a href="/wiki/Extinction_debt" title="Extinction debt">extinction debt</a>.</p>
<p>Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nature_and_nurture" title="Nature and nurture">nature and nurture</a>. The question of whether more extinctions in the <a href="/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil</a> record have been caused by <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of <i>Modeling Extinction</i>, argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions. By contrast, <a href="/wiki/Conservation_biology" title="Conservation biology">conservation biology</a> uses the <a href="/wiki/Extinction_vortex" title="Extinction vortex">extinction vortex</a> model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about <a href="/wiki/Human_extinction" title="Human extinction">human extinction</a> have been raised, for example in Sir <a href="/wiki/Martin_Rees" title="Martin Rees">Martin Rees</a>' 2003 book <i><a href="/wiki/Our_Final_Hour" title="Our Final Hour">Our Final Hour</a></i>, those concerns lie with the effects of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> or <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technological</a> disaster.</p>
<p>Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" title="Conservation movement">conservation</a> programs. Humans can cause extinction of a species through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Overharvesting" title="Overharvesting">overharvesting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a>, introduction of <a href="/wiki/Invasive_species" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a> (such as new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Predator" title="Predator">predators</a> and food <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Competitors" title="Competitors">competitors</a>), overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a> is an essential cause of the extinction crisis. According to the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define "recent" extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed. Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Genetic_pollution" title="Genetic pollution">Genetic pollution</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Purebred" title="Purebred">Purebred</a> wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction through the process of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_pollution" title="Genetic pollution">genetic pollution</a>—i.e., uncontrolled <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Introgression" title="Introgression">introgression</a> genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or <a href="/wiki/Fitness_(biology)" title="Fitness (biology)">out-competition</a> from the introduced (<a href="/wiki/Heterosis" title="Heterosis">or hybrid</a>) species. Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selectively bred</a> by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for <a href="/wiki/Rare_species" title="Rare species">rare species</a> coming into contact with more abundant ones; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interbreeding" title="Interbreeding">interbreeding</a> can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered <a href="/wiki/Wild_water_buffalo" title="Wild water buffalo">wild water buffalo</a> is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from <a href="/wiki/Water_buffalo" title="Water buffalo">the abundant domestic water buffalo</a>). Such extinctions are not always apparent from <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphological</a> (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of <a href="/wiki/Gene_flow" title="Gene flow">gene flow</a> is a normal evolutionarily process, nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Gene_pool" title="Gene pool">gene pool</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Population" title="Population">population</a> is the variety of genetic information in its living members.

Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see <a href="/wiki/Inbreeding" title="Inbreeding">inbreeding</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_bottlenecks" title="Population bottlenecks">population bottlenecks</a>) reduces the range of adaptions possible. Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population, thereby increasing the chance of extinction.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_degradation">Habitat degradation</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">Habitat destruction</a></div>
<p>Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" title="Habitat (ecology)">habitat</a> may alter the <a href="/wiki/Fitness_landscape" title="Fitness landscape">fitness landscape</a> to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming <a href="/wiki/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxic</a>, or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.</p>
<p>Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through <a href="/wiki/Contamination" title="Contamination">contamination</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)" title="Sterilization (microbiology)">sterilizing</a> them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.</p>
<p>Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of <a href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforests</a> and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a <a href="/wiki/Fern" title="Fern">fern</a> that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by <a href="/wiki/Bottom_trawling" title="Bottom trawling">bottom trawling</a>.</p>
<p>Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a> and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Predation.2C_competition.2C_and_disease">Predation, competition, and disease</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Island_restoration" title="Island restoration">Island restoration</a></div>
<p>In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by <a href="/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">transporting</a> <a href="/wiki/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a> from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a> escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an <a href="/wiki/Invasive_species" title="Invasive species">invasive alien species</a> does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)" title="Endemic (ecology)">native</a> species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogens</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parasite" title="Parasite">parasites</a> that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the <a href="/wiki/Megafauna" title="Megafauna">megafauna</a> in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> (12,000 years before present), <a href="/wiki/Madagascar" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coextinction">Coextinction</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Coextinction" title="Coextinction">Coextinction</a></div>

<p>Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of <a href="/wiki/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">parasitic</a> insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its <a href="/wiki/Pollinator" title="Pollinator">pollinator</a>, or to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Predator" title="Predator">predators</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chain</a> who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems ... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one". Coextinction is especially common when a <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species">keystone species</a> goes extinct. Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the <a href="/wiki/Trophic_level" title="Trophic level">trophic levels</a>. Such effects are most severe in <a href="/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)" title="Mutualism (biology)">mutualistic</a> and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the <a href="/wiki/Haast%27s_eagle" title="Haast's eagle">Haast's eagle</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Moa" title="Moa">moa</a>: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct.

<p>There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 350 million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time.

Biologist <a href="/wiki/E._O._Wilson" title="E. O. Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> estimated  in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years. More significantly, the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1000 times "background" rates (the average extinction rates in the <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> time scale of planet Earth), while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher. However, some groups are going extinct much faster.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_scientific_understanding">History of scientific understanding</span></h2>

<p>When it was first described in the 1750s, the idea of extinction was threatening to those who held a belief in the <a href="/wiki/Great_chain_of_being" title="Great chain of being">great chain of being</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theological</a> position that did not allow for "missing links".</p>
<p>The possibility of extinction was not widely accepted before the 1800s. The devoted naturalist, <a href="/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, could “hardly entertain” the idea that humans could cause the extinction of a species. When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply "hiding" in unexplored regions of the Earth. <a href="/wiki/Georges_Cuvier" title="Georges Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> is credited with establishing extinction as a fact in a 1796 lecture to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/French_Institute" title="French Institute">French Institute</a>. Cuvier's observations of fossil bones convinced him that they did not originate in extant animals. This discovery was critical for the spread of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uniformitarianism_(science)" title="Uniformitarianism (science)">uniformitarianism</a>, and led to the first book publicizing the idea of evolution  though Cuvier himself strongly opposed the theories of evolution advanced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lamarck" title="Lamarck">Lamarck</a> and others.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_attitudes_and_interests">Human attitudes and interests</span></h2>
<p>Extinction is an important research topic in the field of <a href="/wiki/Zoology" title="Zoology">zoology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WWF_(conservation_organization)" title="WWF (conservation organization)">Worldwide Fund for Nature</a>, have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">Governments</a> have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous <a href="/wiki/Virus" title="Virus">viruses</a>, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested. Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas. One example was the near extinction of the <a href="/wiki/American_bison" title="American bison">American bison</a>, which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a>, many of whom relied on the bison for food.</p>
<p>Biologist Bruce Walsh of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Arizona" title="University of Arizona">University of Arizona</a> states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species; genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethics</a>; and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.</p>
<p>In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on <i><a href="/wiki/Homo_sapiens" title="Homo sapiens">Homo sapiens</a></i> can be devastating to wildlife (for example, <a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>). <a href="/wiki/Biogeography" title="Biogeography">Biogeographer</a> <a href="/wiki/Jared_Diamond" title="Jared Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> notes that while <a href="/wiki/Big_business" title="Big business">big business</a> may label environmental concerns as "exaggerated", and often cause "devastating damage", some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by <a href="/wiki/National_park" title="National park">national parks</a>.</p>
<p>Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to <a href="/wiki/Ecotourism" title="Ecotourism">ecotourism</a>, and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nature_preserve" title="Nature preserve">Nature preserves</a> are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="Convention on Biological Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> has resulted in international <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biodiversity_Action_Plan" title="Biodiversity Action Plan">Biodiversity Action Plan</a> programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions, work to educate the public and pressure governments into action.</p>
<p>People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction <a href="/wiki/Risk" title="Risk">risks</a>. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with <a href="/wiki/Human_overpopulation" title="Human overpopulation">human overpopulation</a> in tropical <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a>, there has been enormous pressure on forests due to <a href="/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture" title="Subsistence agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Slash-and-burn" title="Slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.</p>

<p>Biologist <a href="/wiki/Olivia_Judson" title="Olivia Judson">Olivia Judson</a> has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquito</a> species. In a September 25, 2003 <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> article, she advocated "specicide" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Recessive" title="Recessive">recessive</a> "<a href="/wiki/Gene_knockout" title="Gene knockout">knockout genes</a>". She says that the <i><a href="/wiki/Anopheles" title="Anopheles">Anopheles</a></i> mosquitoes (which spread <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>) and <i><a href="/wiki/Aedes" title="Aedes">Aedes</a></i> mosquitoes (which spread <a href="/wiki/Dengue_fever" title="Dengue fever">dengue fever</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elephantiasis_tropica" title="Elephantiasis tropica">elephantiasis</a>, and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the <a href="/wiki/Genetic_diversity" title="Genetic diversity">genetic diversity</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Culicidae" title="Culicidae">Culicidae</a> by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and <a href="/wiki/Mosquito#Control" title="Mosquito">mosquito control programs</a> offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_nation" title="Developing nation">developing nations</a> who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."</p>

<p>Some, such as Harvard geneticist <a href="/wiki/George_M._Church" title="George M. Church">George M. Church</a>, believe that ongoing technological advances will let us "bring back to life" an extinct species by <a href="/wiki/Cloning#Cloning_extinct_and_endangered_species" title="Cloning">cloning</a>, using <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the <a href="/wiki/Mammoth" title="Mammoth">mammoth</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Thylacine" title="Thylacine">thylacine</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenean_ibex" title="Pyrenean ibex">Pyrenean ibex</a>. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though <a href="/wiki/Bioethics" title="Bioethics">bioethical</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> objections have been raised, the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.</p>
<p>In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (<i>C. p. pyrenaica</i>). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and <a href="/wiki/Mountain_goat" title="Mountain goat">mountain goat</a>-<a href="/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">domestic goat</a> hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died. In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.</p>
