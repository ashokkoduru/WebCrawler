<p>Eco-socialists are critical of many past and existing forms of both <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Green politics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a>. They are often described as "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_(political_adjective)" title="Red (political adjective)">Red</a> Greens" - adherents to Green politics with clear <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> views, often inspired by <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> (Red Greens are in contrast to <a href="/wiki/Eco-capitalism" title="Eco-capitalism">eco-capitalists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Green_anarchism" title="Green anarchism">Green anarchists</a>).</p>
<p>The term "watermelon" is commonly applied, often pejoratively, to <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Greens</a> who seem to put "<a href="/wiki/Social_justice" title="Social justice">social justice</a>" goals above <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> ones, implying they are "green on the outside but red on the inside"; the term is usually attributed to either <a href="/wiki/Petr_Beckmann" title="Petr Beckmann">Petr Beckmann</a> or, more frequently, <a href="/wiki/Warren_T._Brookes" title="Warren T. Brookes">Warren T. Brookes</a>, both critics of <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a>, and is common in Australia, New Zealand and the United States.</p>
<p>A New Zealand website, <i>The Watermelon</i>, uses the term proudly, stating that it is "green on the outside and <a href="/wiki/Social_liberalism" title="Social liberalism">liberal</a> on the inside", while also citing "socialist political leanings", reflecting the use of the term "liberal" to describe the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Left_wing" title="Left wing">left wing</a> in many English-speaking countries. Red Greens are often considered "<a href="/wiki/Fundi_(politics)" title="Fundi (politics)">fundies</a>" or "fundamentalist greens", a term usually associated with <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">Deep Ecology</a> even though the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Green_Party" title="German Green Party">German Green Party</a> "fundi" faction included eco-socialists, and eco-socialists in other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_Parties" title="Green Parties">Green Parties</a>, like <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Derek Wall</a>, have been described in the press as fundies.</p>
<p>Eco-socialists also criticise bureaucratic and elite theories of self-described socialism such as <a href="/wiki/Maoism" title="Maoism">Maoism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and what other critics have termed <a href="/wiki/Bureaucratic_collectivism" title="Bureaucratic collectivism">bureaucratic collectivism</a> or <a href="/wiki/State_capitalism" title="State capitalism">state capitalism</a>. Instead, eco-socialists focus on imbuing socialism with ecology while keeping the emancipatory goals of "first-epoch" socialism. Eco-socialists aim for communal ownership of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> by "freely associated producers" with all forms of domination eclipsed, especially <a href="/wiki/Ecofeminism" title="Ecofeminism">gender inequality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a>.</p>
<p>This often includes the restoration of <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a> land in opposition to <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private property</a>, in which local control of resources valorizes the Marxist concept of <a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use value</a> above <a href="/wiki/Exchange_value" title="Exchange value">exchange value</a>. Practically, eco-socialists have generated various strategies to mobilise action on an <a href="/wiki/Internationalism_(politics)" title="Internationalism (politics)">internationalist</a> basis, developing networks of grassroots individuals and groups that can radically transform society through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-violence" title="Non-violence">nonviolent</a> "prefigurative projects" for a <a href="/wiki/Post-capitalism" title="Post-capitalism">post-capitalist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anti-statism" title="Anti-statism">post-statist</a> world.</p>

<p>Contrary to the depiction of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> by some environmentalists, <a href="/wiki/Social_ecology" title="Social ecology">social ecologists</a> and fellow <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialists</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Productivism" title="Productivism">productivist</a> who favoured the domination of nature, eco-socialists have revisited Marx's writings and believe that he "was a main originator of the <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> world-view". Eco-socialist authors, like <a href="/wiki/John_Bellamy_Foster" title="John Bellamy Foster">John Bellamy Foster</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Paul_Burkett&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Paul Burkett (page does not exist)">Paul Burkett</a>, point to Marx's discussion of a "metabolic rift" between man and nature, his statement that "private ownership of the globe by single individuals will appear quite absurd as private ownership of one man by another" and his observation that a society must "hand it [the planet] down to succeeding generations in an improved condition". Nonetheless, other eco-socialists feel that Marx overlooked a "recognition of nature in and for itself", ignoring its "receptivity" and treating nature as "subjected to labor from the start" in an "entirely active relationship".</p>
<p>Therefore, <a href="/wiki/William_Morris" title="William Morris">William Morris</a>, the <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> novelist, poet and designer, is largely credited with developing key principles of what was later called eco-socialism.

<p>Green anarchism, or ecoanarchism, is a <a href="/wiki/Anarchist_schools_of_thought" title="Anarchist schools of thought">school of thought</a> within <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> which puts a particular emphasis on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_issues" title="Environmental issues">environmental issues</a>. An important early influence was the thought of the American <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchist</a> <a href="/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> and his book <i><a href="/wiki/Walden" title="Walden">Walden</a></i> as well as <a href="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elisee_Reclus" title="Elisee Reclus">Elisee Reclus</a>. In the late 19th century there emerged <a href="/wiki/Anarcho-naturism" title="Anarcho-naturism">anarcho-naturism</a> as the fusion of anarchism and <a href="/wiki/Naturism" title="Naturism">naturist</a> philosophies within <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Individualist_anarchist" title="Individualist anarchist">individualist anarchist</a> circles in France, Spain, Cuba and Portugal. Several anarchists from the mid-20th century, including <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Read" title="Herbert Read">Herbert Read</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethel_Mannin" title="Ethel Mannin">Ethel Mannin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leopold_Kohr" title="Leopold Kohr">Leopold Kohr</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Ellul" title="Jacques Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paul_Goodman_(writer)" title="Paul Goodman (writer)">Paul Goodman</a>, also held proto-environmental views linked to their anarchism. Mannin's 1944 book <i>Bread and Roses: A Utopian Survey and Blue-Print</i> has been described by anarchist historian <a href="/wiki/Robert_Graham_(historian)" title="Robert Graham (historian)">Robert Graham</a> as setting forth "an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecological" title="Ecological">ecological</a> vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive <a href="/wiki/Industrial_society" title="Industrial society">industrial</a> organization of society".

<p>Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of <a href="/wiki/Murray_Bookchin" title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> and influenced by anarchist <a href="/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>. Social ecologists assert that the present <a href="/wiki/Ecological_crisis" title="Ecological crisis">ecological crisis</a> has its roots in human social problems, and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human. In 1958, Murray Bookchin defined himself as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anarchist" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a>, seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology. His first book, <i><a href="/wiki/Our_Synthetic_Environment" title="Our Synthetic Environment">Our Synthetic Environment</a>,</i> was published under the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Lewis Herber in 1962, a few months before <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a></i>. The book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism. His groundbreaking essay "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" introduced <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a> as a concept in radical politics. In 1968 he founded another group that published the influential <i>Anarchos</i> magazine, which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy, and on decentralization and miniaturization. Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the <a href="/wiki/Counterculture" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a>.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Post-Scarcity_Anarchism" title="Post-Scarcity Anarchism">Post-Scarcity Anarchism</a></i> is a collection of <a href="/wiki/Essay" title="Essay">essays</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Murray_Bookchin" title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> and first published in 1971 by Ramparts Press. It outlines the possible form <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> might take under conditions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_scarcity" title="Post scarcity">post-scarcity</a>. It is one of Bookchin's major works, and its radical thesis provoked controversy for being <a href="/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia">utopian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Messianism" title="Messianism">messianic</a> in its faith in the liberatory potential of <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a>. Bookchin argues that <a href="/wiki/Post-industrial_society" title="Post-industrial society">post-industrial societies</a> are also post-scarcity societies, and can thus imagine "the fulfillment of the social and cultural potentialities latent in a technology of abundance". The self-administration of society is now made possible by technological advancement and, when technology is used in an ecologically sensitive manner, the revolutionary potential of society will be much changed. In 1982, his book <i>The Ecology of Freedom</i> had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement, both in the United States and abroad. He was a principal figure in the Burlington Greens in 1986-90, an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to create neighborhood democracy.</p>
<p>Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communalism_(Political_Philosophy)" title="Communalism (Political Philosophy)">Communalism</a>" (spelled with a capital "C" to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of <a href="/wiki/Social_anarchism" title="Social anarchism">Social anarchism</a>, he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and radical ecology.</p>
<p>Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Libertarian_Municipalism" title="Libertarian Municipalism">Libertarian Municipalism</a> which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_capitalist_expansion_and_globalisation">Critique of capitalist expansion and globalisation</span></h2>
<p>Merging aspects of <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, socialism, <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a> and ecology, eco-socialists generally believe that the <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> system is the cause of <a href="/wiki/Social_exclusion" title="Social exclusion">social exclusion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">inequality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_degradation" title="Environmental degradation">environmental degradation</a> through <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a> and imperialism under the supervision of repressive states and transnational structures.</p>
<p>In the <i>Ecosocialist manifesto</i>, <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_L%C3%B6wy" title="Michael Löwy">Löwy</a> suggest that capitalist expansion causes both "crises of ecology" through "rampant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a>" and "societal breakdown" that springs "from the form of imperialism known as globalization". They believe that capitalism's expansion "exposes <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>" to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pollutants" title="Pollutants">pollutants</a>, habitat destruction and <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource depletion</a>, "reducing the sensuous vitality of <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a> to the cold exchangeability required for the accumulation of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>", while submerging "the majority of the world's people to a mere reservoir of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labour_(economics)" title="Labour (economics)">labor</a> power" as it penetrates communities through "<a href="/wiki/Consumerism" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a> and depoliticization".</p>
<p>Other eco-socialists, like <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a>, highlight how, in the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free-market" title="Free-market">free-market</a> capitalism structures economies to produce <a href="/wiki/Cash_crop" title="Cash crop">export-geared crops</a> that take water from traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsistence_farming" title="Subsistence farming">subsistence farms</a>, increasing hunger and the likelihood of <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a>; furthermore, forests are increasingly <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">cleared</a> and <a href="/wiki/Enclosure" title="Enclosure">enclosed</a> to produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cash_crops" title="Cash crops">cash crops</a> that separate people from their local <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> and aggravate <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a>. <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a> shows that many of the world's poor have access to the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> through "non-monetised communal <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>", such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsistence_farming" title="Subsistence farming">subsistence farming</a>, but, despite providing for need and a level of prosperity, these are not included in conventional economics measures, like <a href="/wiki/Measures_of_national_income_and_output" title="Measures of national income and output">GNP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a> therefore views <a href="/wiki/Neoliberalism" title="Neoliberalism">neo-liberal</a> globalization as "part of the long struggle of the state and commercial interests to steal from those who subsist" by removing "access to the resources that sustain ordinary people across the globe". Furthermore, Kovel sees <a href="/wiki/Neoliberalism" title="Neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a> as "a return to the pure logic of capital" that "has effectively swept away measures which had inhibited capital’s aggressivity, replacing them with naked exploitation of humanity and nature"; for Kovel, this "tearing down of boundaries and limits to accumulation is known as globalization", which was "a deliberate response to a serious accumulation crisis (in the 1970s) that had convinced the leaders of the global economy to install what we know as neoliberalism.".</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="/wiki/Ramachandra_Guha" title="Ramachandra Guha">Guha</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Juan_Martinez-Alier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Juan Martinez-Alier (page does not exist)">Martinez-Alier</a> blame globalization for creating increased levels of <a href="/wiki/Waste" title="Waste">waste</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, and then dumping the <a href="/wiki/Waste" title="Waste">waste</a> on the most vulnerable in society, particularly those in the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a>. Others have also noted that capitalism disproportionately affects the poorest in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_North" title="Global North">Global North</a> as well, leading to examples of resistance such as the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environmental justice</a> movement in the United States, consisting of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> people and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethnic_minorities" title="Ethnic minorities">ethnic minorities</a> who highlight the tendency for waste dumps, major road projects and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incinerator" title="Incinerator">incinerators</a> to be constructed around socially excluded areas. However, as <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a> highlights, such campaigns are often ignored or persecuted precisely because they originate among the most marginalized in society: the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/African-American" title="African-American">African-American</a> radical green religious group <a href="/wiki/MOVE" title="MOVE">MOVE</a>, campaigning for ecological revolution and <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> from <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, had many members imprisoned or even killed by US authorities from the 1970s onwards.</p>
<p>Eco-socialism disagrees with the elite theories of capitalism, which tend to label a specific <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a> or social group as conspirators who construct a system that satisfies their greed and personal desires. Instead, eco-socialists suggest that the very system itself is self-perpetuating, fuelled by "extra-human" or "impersonal" forces. Kovel uses the <a href="/wiki/Bhopal_disaster" title="Bhopal disaster">Bhopal industrial disaster</a> as an example. Many <a href="/wiki/Anti-corporate_activism" title="Anti-corporate activism">anti-corporate</a> observers would blame the avarice of those at the top of many <a href="/wiki/Multinational_corporation" title="Multinational corporation">multi-national corporations</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Union_Carbide" title="Union Carbide">Union Carbide</a> Corporation in <a href="/wiki/Bhopal_disaster" title="Bhopal disaster">Bhopal</a>, for seemingly isolated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_accident" title="Industrial accident">industrial accidents</a>. Conversely, Kovel suggests that <a href="/wiki/Bhopal_disaster" title="Bhopal disaster">Union Carbide</a> were experiencing a decrease in sales that led to falling profits, which, due to <a href="/wiki/Stock_market" title="Stock market">stock market</a> conditions, translated into a drop in share values. The depreciation of share value made many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shareholders" title="Shareholders">shareholders</a> sell their stock, weakening the company and leading to cost-cutting measures that eroded the safety procedures and mechanisms at the Bhopal site. Though this did not, in Kovel's mind, make the Bhopal disaster inevitable, he believes that it illustrates the effect <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a> forces can have on increasing the likelihood of ecological and social problems.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_and_exchange_value">Use and exchange value</span></h3>
<p>Eco-socialism focuses closely on <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx's</a> theories about the contradiction between <a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use values</a> and <a href="/wiki/Exchange_value" title="Exchange value">exchange values</a>. <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> posits that, within a <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market economy</a>, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods; as we have to keep selling in order to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods.</p>
<p>Such goods, in an eco-socialist analysis, produce <a href="/wiki/Exchange_value" title="Exchange value">exchange values</a> but have no <a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use value</a>. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities - such as caring for relatives full-time and basic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsistence" title="Subsistence">subsistence</a> – are unrewarded, while unnecessary commodities earn individuals huge fortunes and fuel <a href="/wiki/Consumerism" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource depletion</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_.22second_contradiction.22_of_capitalism">The "second contradiction" of capitalism</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_O%27Connor_(academic)" title="James O'Connor (academic)">James O'Connor</a> argues for a "second contradiction" of underproduction, to complement <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>'s "first" contradiction of capital and labor. While the second contradiction is often considered a theory of environmental degradation, O'Connor's theory in fact goes much further. Building on the work of Karl Polanyi, along with Marx, O'Connor argues that capitalism necessarily undermines the "conditions of production" necessary to sustain the endless accumulation of capital. These conditions of production include soil, water, energy, and so forth. But they also include an adequate public education system, transportation infrastructures, and other services that are not produced directly by capital, but which capital needs in order accumulate effectively. As the conditions of production are exhausted, the costs of production for capital increase. For this reason, the second contradiction generates an underproduction crisis tendency, with the rising cost of inputs and labor, to complement the overproduction tendency of too many commodities for too few customers. Like Marx's contradiction of capital and labor, the second contradiction therefore threatens the system's existence.</p>
<p>In addition, O'Connor believes that, in order to remedy environmental contradictions, the capitalist system innovates new technologies that overcome existing problems but introduce new ones.</p>
<p>O'Connor cites <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> as an example, which he sees as a form of producing energy that is advertised as an alternative to carbon-intensive, non-renewable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>, but creates long-term <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_waste" title="Radioactive waste">radioactive waste</a> and other dangers to health and security. While O'Connor believes that capitalism is capable of spreading out its economic supports so widely that it can afford to destroy one <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> before moving onto another, he and many other eco-socialists now fear that, with the onset of globalization, the system is running out of new <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>. Kovel adds that capitalist firms have to continue to extract profit through a combination of intensive or extensive exploitation and selling to new markets, meaning that capitalism must <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">grow</a> indefinitely to exist, which he thinks is impossible on a planet of finite resources.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_role_of_the_state_and_transnational_organisations">The role of the state and transnational organisations</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">Capitalist</a> expansion is seen by eco-socialists as being "hand in glove" with "corrupt and subservient client states" that repress dissent against the system, governed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_organisation" title="International organisation">international organisations</a> "under the overall supervision of the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">Western powers</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Superpower" title="Superpower">superpower</a> United States", which subordinate peripheral nations economically and militarily. <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> further claims that capitalism itself spurs conflict and, ultimately, <a href="/wiki/War" title="War">war</a>. Kovel states that the '<a href="/wiki/War_on_Terror" title="War on Terror">War on Terror</a>', between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Islamist_extremists" title="Islamist extremists">Islamist extremists</a> and the United States, is caused by "oil imperialism", whereby the capitalist nations require control over sources of <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a>, especially oil, which are necessary to continue intensive <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">industrial growth</a> - in the quest for control of such resources, Kovel argues that the capitalist nations, specifically the United States, have come into conflict with the predominantly <a href="/wiki/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> nations where oil is often found.</p>
<p>Eco-socialists believe that state or self-<a href="/wiki/Regulatory_economics" title="Regulatory economics">regulation</a> of markets does not solve the crisis "because to do so requires setting limits upon accumulation", which is "unacceptable" for a <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">growth</a>-orientated system; they believe that <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and revolutionary impulses cannot be tackled properly "because to do so would mean abandoning the logic of <a href="/wiki/Empire" title="Empire">empire</a>". Instead, eco-socialists feel that increasing repressive <a href="/wiki/Counter-terrorism" title="Counter-terrorism">counter-terrorism</a> increases <a href="/wiki/Social_alienation" title="Social alienation">alienation</a> and causes further <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and believe that state <a href="/wiki/Counter-terrorism" title="Counter-terrorism">counter-terrorist</a> methods are, in Kovel and <a href="/wiki/Michael_L%C3%B6wy" title="Michael Löwy">Löwy</a>'s words, "evolving into a new and malignant variation of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a>". They echo <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a>'s "stark choice" between "socialism or barbarism", which was believed to be a prediction of the coming of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a> and further forms of destructive capitalism at the beginning of the twentieth century (<a href="/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Luxemburg</a> was in fact murdered by proto-<a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascist</a> <a href="/wiki/Freikorps" title="Freikorps">Freikorps</a> in the revolutionary atmosphere of Germany in 1919).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tensions_within_the_Eco-Socialist_discourse">Tensions within the Eco-Socialist discourse</span></h2>
<p>Reflecting tensions within the environmental and socialist movements, there is some conflict of ideas. In practice however, a synthesis is emerging which calls for democratic regulation of industry in the interests of people and the environment, nationalisation of some key (environmental) industries, local democracy and an extension of co-ops and the library principle.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_other_forms_of_green_politics">Critique of other forms of green politics</span></h2>

<p>Eco-socialists criticise many within the <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Green movement</a> for not being overtly <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a>, for working within the existing <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Statism" title="Statism">statist</a> system, for <a href="/wiki/Voluntarism_(action)" title="Voluntarism (action)">voluntarism</a>, or for reliance on technological fixes. The eco-socialist ideology is based on a critique of other forms of Green politics, including various forms of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_economics" title="Green economics">Green economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Localism_(politics)" title="Localism (politics)">Localism</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deep_Ecology" title="Deep Ecology">Deep Ecology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">Bioregionalism</a> and even some manifestations of radical <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">green ideologies</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-feminism" title="Eco-feminism">Eco-feminism</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_Ecology" title="Social Ecology">Social Ecology</a>.</p>
<p>As Kovel puts it, eco-socialism differs from Green politics at the most fundamental level because the '<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Four_Pillars_of_the_Green_Party&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Four Pillars of the Green Party (page does not exist)">Four Pillars</a>' of Green politics (and the 'Ten Key Values' of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)" title="Green Party (United States)">US Green Party</a>) do not include the demand for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emancipation_of_labour" title="Emancipation of labour">emancipation of labour</a> and the end of the separation between producers and the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>. Many eco-socialists also oppose <a href="/wiki/Malthusianism" title="Malthusianism">Malthusianism</a> and are alarmed by the gulf between Green politics in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_North" title="Global North">Global North</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Opposition_to_within-system_approaches.2C_voluntarism_and_technological_fixes">Opposition to within-system approaches, voluntarism and technological fixes</span></h3>
<p>Eco-socialists are highly critical of those <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Greens</a> who favour "working within the system". While eco-socialists like <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> recognise the ability of within-system approaches to raise awareness, and believe that "the struggle for an <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecologically</a> rational world must include a struggle for the state", he believes that the mainstream Green movement is too easily co-opted by the current powerful socio-political forces as it "passes from citizen-based <a href="/wiki/Activism" title="Activism">activism</a> to ponderous bureaucracies scuffling for 'a seat at the table'".</p>
<p>For Kovel, capitalism is "happy to enlist" the Green movement for "convenience", "control over popular dissent" and "rationalization". He further attacks within-system green initiatives like <a href="/wiki/Carbon_emission_trading" title="Carbon emission trading">carbon trading</a>, which he sees as a "capitalist shell game" that turns <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> "into a fresh source of profit". <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Brian_Tokar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Brian Tokar (page does not exist)">Brian Tokar</a> has further criticised carbon trading in this way, suggesting that it augments existing class inequality and gives the "largest 'players'... substantial control over the whole 'game'".</p>
<p>In addition, Kovel criticises the "defeatism" of <a href="/wiki/Voluntarism_(action)" title="Voluntarism (action)">voluntarism</a> in some local forms of <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a> that do not connect: he suggests that they can be "drawn off into <a href="/wiki/Individualism" title="Individualism">individualism</a>" or co-opted to the demands of capitalism, as in the case of certain <a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a> projects, where citizens are "induced to provide free labor" to <a href="/wiki/Waste_management" title="Waste management">waste management</a> industries who are involved in the "capitalization of nature". He labels the notion on <a href="/wiki/Voluntarism_(action)" title="Voluntarism (action)">voluntarism</a> "<a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">ecopolitics</a> without struggle".</p>
<p>Technological fixes to <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> problems are also rejected by eco-socialists. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Saral_Sarkar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Saral Sarkar (page does not exist)">Saral Sarkar</a> has updated the thesis of 1970s '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Limits_to_growth" title="Limits to growth">limits to growth</a>' to exemplify the limits of new capitalist technologies such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel_cell" title="Hydrogen fuel cell">hydrogen fuel cells</a>, which require large amounts of energy to split molecules to obtain hydrogen. Furthermore, Kovel notes that "events in nature are reciprocal and multi-determined" and can therefore not be predictably "fixed"; socially, technologies cannot solve social problems because they are not "mechanical". He posits an eco-socialist analysis, developed from <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>, that patterns of production and social organisation are more important than the forms of technology used within a given configuration of society.</p>
<p>Under <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, he suggests that technology "has been the <i>sine qua non</i> of <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">growth</a>" - thus he believes that, even in a world with hypothetical "free energy", the effect would be to lower the cost of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobile</a> production, leading to the massive <a href="/wiki/Overproduction" title="Overproduction">overproduction</a> of <a href="/wiki/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">vehicles</a>, "collapsing infrastructure", chronic <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource depletion</a> and the "paving over" of the "remainder of <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>". In the modern world, Kovel considers the supposed efficiency of new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post-industrial" title="Post-industrial">post-industrial</a> commodities is a "plain illusion", as <a href="/wiki/Miniaturization" title="Miniaturization">miniaturized</a> components involve many substances and are therefore non-<a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recyclable</a> (and, theoretically, only simple substances could be retrieved by burning out-of-date equipment, releasing more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pollutants" title="Pollutants">pollutants</a>). He is quick to warn "environmental <a href="/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberals</a>" against over-selling the virtues of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energies</a> that cannot meet the mass energy consumption of the era; although he would still support <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> projects, he believes it is more important to restructure societies to reduce energy use before relying on <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> technologies alone.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_Green_economics">Critique of Green economics</span></h3>
<p>Eco-socialists have based their ideas for political strategy on a critique of several different trends in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_economics" title="Green economics">Green economics</a>. At the most fundamental level, eco-socialists reject what Kovel calls "<a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">ecological economics</a>" or the "ecological wing of mainstream economics" for being "uninterested in social transformation". He furthers rejects the <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Neo-Smithian</a> school, who believe in <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s vision of "a capitalism of small producers, freely exchanging with each other", which is self-regulating and competitive.</p>
<p>The school is represented by thinkers like <a href="/wiki/David_Korten" title="David Korten">David Korten</a> who believe in "regulated markets" checked by <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a> and <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" title="Civil society">civil society</a> but, for Kovel, they do not provide a critique of the expansive nature of capitalism away from localised production and ignore "questions of <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a> or any other category of domination". Kovel also criticises their "fairy-tale" view of history, which refers to the abuse of "<a href="/wiki/Natural_capital" title="Natural capital">natural capital</a>" by the <a href="/wiki/Materialism" title="Materialism">materialism</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scientific_Revolution" title="Scientific Revolution">Scientific Revolution</a>, an assumption that, in Kovel's eyes, seems to suggest that "nature had toiled to put the gift of capital into human hands", rather than capitalism being a product of social relations in human history.</p>
<p>Other forms of <a href="/wiki/Community-based_economics" title="Community-based economics">Community-based economics</a> are also rejected by eco-socialists such as Kovel, including followers of <a href="/wiki/E._F._Schumacher" title="E. F. Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</a> and some members of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cooperative_movement" title="Cooperative movement">Cooperative movement</a>, for advocating "no more than a very halting and isolated first step". He thinks that their principles are "only partially realizable within the institutions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cooperative_movement" title="Cooperative movement">cooperatives</a> in capitalist society" because "the internal cooperation" of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cooperative_movement" title="Cooperative movement">cooperatives</a> is "forever hemmed in and compromised" by the need to expand value and compete within the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a>. <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a> also believed that <a href="/wiki/Cooperative" title="Cooperative">cooperatives</a> within capitalism make workers into "their own capitalist... by enabling them to use the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> for the employment of their own labour".</p>
<p>For Kovel and other eco-socialists, <a href="/wiki/Community-based_economics" title="Community-based economics">Community-based economics</a> and Green <a href="/wiki/Localism_(politics)" title="Localism (politics)">Localism</a> are "a fantasy" because "strict <a href="/wiki/Localism_(politics)" title="Localism (politics)">localism</a> belongs to the aboriginal stages of society" and would be an "ecological nightmare at present population levels" due to "heat losses from a multitude of dispersed sites, the squandering of scarce resources, the needless reproduction of effort, and cultural impoverishment". While he feels that small-scale production units are "an essential part of the path towards an ecological society", he sees them not as "an end in itself"; in his view, small enterprises can be either capitalist or <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> in their configuration and therefore must be "consistently <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a>", through recognition and support of the emancipation of labour, and exist "in a dialectic with the whole of things", as human society will need large-scale projects, such as transport infrastructures.</p>
<p>He highlights the work of <a href="/wiki/Herman_Daly" title="Herman Daly">Herman Daly</a>, who exemplifies what eco-socialists see as the good and bad points of <a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">ecological economics</a> - while he offers a critique of capitalism and a desire for "workers ownership", he only believes in workers ownership "kept firmly within a capitalist market", ignoring the eco-socialist desire for struggle in the emancipation of labour and hoping that the interests of labour and management today can be improved so that they are "in harmony".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_Deep_Ecology">Critique of Deep Ecology</span></h3>
<p>Despite the inclusion of both in political factions like the '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fundies" title="Fundies">Fundies</a>' of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Green_Party" title="German Green Party">German Green Party</a>, eco-socialists and <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecologists</a> hold markedly opposite views. Eco-socialists like Kovel have attacked <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecology</a> because, like other forms of Green politics and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_economics" title="Green economics">Green economics</a>, it features "virtuous souls" who have "no internal connection with the critique of capitalism and the emancipation of labor". Kovel is particularly scathing about <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecology</a> and its "fatuous pronouncement" that Green politics is "neither left nor right, but ahead", which, for him, ignores the notion that "that which does not confront the system comes its instrument".</p>
<p>Even more scathingly, Kovel suggests that in "its effort to decentre humanity within nature", <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecologists</a> can "go too far" and argue for the "splitting away of unwanted people", as evidenced by their desire to preserve <a href="/wiki/Wilderness" title="Wilderness">wilderness</a> by removing the groups that have lived there "from <a href="/wiki/Time_immemorial" title="Time immemorial">time immemorial</a>". Kovel thinks that this lends legitimacy to "<a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> elites", like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_State_Department" title="US State Department">US State Department</a> and the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, who can make preservation of <a href="/wiki/Wilderness" title="Wilderness">wilderness</a> a part of their projects that "have added value as sites for <a href="/wiki/Ecotourism" title="Ecotourism">ecotourism</a>" but remove people from their land. Between 1986 and 1996, Kovel notes that over three million people were displaced by "conservation projects"; in the making of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_National_Parks" title="US National Parks">US National Parks</a>, three hundred <a href="/wiki/Shoshone" title="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Indians</a> were killed in the development of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yosemite" title="Yosemite">Yosemite</a>.</p>
<p>Kovel believes that <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecology</a> has affected the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Green movement</a> and led to calls from restrictions on <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a>, "often allying with reactionaries in a... cryptically <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racist</a> quest". Indeed, he finds traces of <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecology</a> in the "biological reduction" of <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, an ideology many "organicist thinkers" have found appealing, including <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Gruhl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Herbert Gruhl (page does not exist)">Herbert Gruhl</a>, a founder of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Green_Party" title="German Green Party">German Green Party</a> (who subsequently left when it became more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Left-wing" title="Left-wing">Left-wing</a>) and originator of the phrase "neither left nor right, but ahead". Kovel warns that, while '<a href="/wiki/Ecofascism" title="Ecofascism">ecofascism</a>' is confined to a narrow band of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Far_right" title="Far right">far right</a> intellectuals and disaffected <a href="/wiki/White_power_skinhead" title="White power skinhead">white power skinheads</a> who involved themselves alongside <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Far_left" title="Far left">far left</a> groups in the <a href="/wiki/Anti-globalization_movement" title="Anti-globalization movement">anti-globalization movement</a>, it may be "imposed as a <a href="/wiki/Revolution_from_above" title="Revolution from above">revolution from above</a> to install an <a href="/wiki/Authoritarianism" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarian</a> regime in order to preserve the main workings of the system" in times of crisis.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_bioregionalism">Critique of bioregionalism</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">Bioregionalism</a>, a philosophy developed by writers like <a href="/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Sale" title="Kirkpatrick Sale">Kirkpatrick Sale</a> who believe in the self-sufficiency of "appropriate bioregional boundaries" drawn up by inhabitants of "an area", has been thoroughly critiqued by <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a>, who fears that the "vagueness" of the area will lead to conflict and further boundaries between communities. While <a href="/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Sale" title="Kirkpatrick Sale">Sale</a> cites the <a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">bioregional</a> living of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a>, Kovel notes that such ideas are impossible to translate to populations of modern proportions, and evidences the fact that <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a> held land in <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private property</a> - thus, for eco-socialists, <a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">bioregionalism</a> provides no understanding of what is needed to transform society, and what the inevitable "response of the capitalist state" would be to people constructing <a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">bioregionalism</a>.</p>
<p>Kovel also attacks the problems of self-sufficiency. Where <a href="/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Sale" title="Kirkpatrick Sale">Sale</a> believes in self-sufficient regions "each developing the energy of its peculiar ecology", such as "wood in the northwest [USA]", Kovel asks "how on earth" these can be made sufficient for regional needs, and notes the environmental damage of converting <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> into a "forest-destroying and smoke-spewing wood-burning" city. Kovel also questions <a href="/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Sale" title="Kirkpatrick Sale">Sale</a>'s insistence on <a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">bioregions</a> that do "not require connections with the outside, but within strict limits", and whether this precludes journeys to visit family members and other forms of travel.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_variants_of_eco-feminism">Critique of variants of eco-feminism</span></h3>
<p>Like many variants of socialism and Green politics, eco-socialists recognise the importance of "the gendered bifurcation of nature" and support the emancipation of <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a> as it "is at the root of <a href="/wiki/Patriarchy" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a>". Nevertheless, while Kovel believes that "any path out of capitalism must also be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-feminism" title="Eco-feminism">eco-feminist</a>", he criticises types of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-feminism" title="Eco-feminism">ecofeminism</a> that are not <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> and can "essentialize women's closeness to nature and build from there, submerging history into nature", becoming more at place in the "comforts of the <a href="/wiki/New_Age" title="New Age">New Age</a> Growth Centre". These limitations, for Kovel, "keep <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-feminism" title="Eco-feminism">ecofeminism</a> from becoming a coherent social movement".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_Social_Ecology">Critique of Social Ecology</span></h3>
<p>While having much in common with the radical tradition of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_Ecology" title="Social Ecology">Social Ecology</a>, eco-socialists still see themselves as distinct. <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> believes this is because Social Ecologists see hierarchy "in-itself" as the cause of <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> destruction, whereas eco-socialists focus on <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a> domination embodied in capitalism and recognise that forms of authority that are not "an expropriation of human power for... self-aggrandizement", such as a student-teacher relationship that is "reciprocal and mutual", are beneficial.</p>
<p>In practice, Kovel describes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_Ecology" title="Social Ecology">Social Ecology</a> as continuing the <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchist</a> tradition of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-violent_direct_action" title="Non-violent direct action">non-violent direct action</a>, which is "necessary" but "not sufficient" because "it leaves unspoken the question of building an ecological society beyond <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capital</a>". Furthermore, Social Ecologists and <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> tend to focus on the state alone, rather than the class relations behind state domination (in the view of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marxists</a>). Kovel fears that this is political, springing from historic hostility to <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> among anarchists and sectarianism, which he points out as a fault of the "brilliant" but "dogmatic" founder of Social Ecology, <a href="/wiki/Murray_Bookchin" title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Opposition_to_Malthusianism_and_Neo-Malthusianism">Opposition to Malthusianism and Neo-Malthusianism</span></h3>
<p>While <a href="/wiki/Malthusianism" title="Malthusianism">Malthusianism</a> and eco-socialism overlap within the <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Green movement</a> because both address <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">over-industrialism</a>, and despite the fact that Eco-socialists, like many within the Green movement, are described as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neo-malthusianism" title="Neo-malthusianism">neo-Malthusian</a> because of their criticism of <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a>, Eco-socialists are opposed to <a href="/wiki/Malthusianism" title="Malthusianism">Malthusianism</a>. This divergence stems from the difference between <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marxist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malthusianism" title="Malthusianism">Malthusian</a> examinations of social injustice - whereas Marx blames <a href="/wiki/Social_inequality" title="Social inequality">inequality</a> on <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a> injustice, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus">Malthus</a> argued that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> remained poor because of their greater <a href="/wiki/Fertility" title="Fertility">fertility</a> and <a href="/wiki/Birth_rate" title="Birth rate">birth rates</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neo-malthusianism" title="Neo-malthusianism">Neo-Malthusians</a> have slightly modified this analysis by increasing their focus on <a href="/wiki/Overconsumption" title="Overconsumption">overconsumption</a> - nonetheless, eco-socialists find this attention inadequate. They point to the fact that Malthus did not thoroughly examine ecology and that <a href="/wiki/Garrett_Hardin" title="Garrett Hardin">Garrett Hardin</a>, a key Neo-Malthusian, suggested that further <a href="/wiki/Enclosure" title="Enclosure">enclosed</a> and privatised land, as opposed to <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a>, would solve the chief environmental problem, which Hardin labeled the '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons" title="Tragedy of the Commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>'.</p>

Nonetheless, other eco-socialists, such as <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a>, have also pointed out that capitalism disproportionately affects the poorest in the Global North as well, leading to examples of resistance such as the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environmental justice</a> movement in the US and groups like <a href="/wiki/MOVE" title="MOVE">MOVE</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_other_forms_of_socialism">Critique of other forms of socialism</span></h2>
<p>Eco-socialists choose to use the term '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist">socialist</a>', despite "the failings of its twentieth century interpretations", because it "still stands for the supersession of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capital</a>" and thus "the name, and the reality" must "become adequate for this time". Eco-socialists have nonetheless often diverged with other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marxist" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> movements. Eco-socialism has also been partly influenced by and associated with <a href="/wiki/Agrarian_socialism" title="Agrarian socialism">agrarian socialism</a> as well as some forms of <a href="/wiki/Christian_socialism" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</a>, especially in the United States.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_.27Actually_Existing_Socialisms.27">Critique of 'Actually Existing Socialisms'</span></h3>
<p>For Kovel and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Michael_Lowy" title="Michael Lowy">Lowy</a>, eco-socialism is "the realization of the “first-epoch” socialisms" by resurrecting the notion of "free development of all producers", distancing themselves from "the attenuated, reformist aims of <a href="/wiki/Social_democracy" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Productivism" title="Productivism">productivist</a> structures of the <a href="/wiki/Bureaucratic_collectivism" title="Bureaucratic collectivism">bureaucratic variations</a> of socialism", such as forms of <a href="/wiki/Leninism" title="Leninism">Leninism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>. They ground the failure of past <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist">socialist</a> movements in "underdevelopment in the context of hostility by existing <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> powers", which led to "the denial of internal democracy" and "emulation of capitalist <a href="/wiki/Productivism" title="Productivism">productivism</a>". Kovel believes that the forms of 'actually existing socialism' consisted of "public ownership of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>", rather than meeting "the true definition" of socialism as "a <a href="/wiki/Free_association_(communism_and_anarchism)" title="Free association (communism and anarchism)">free association of producers</a>", with the Party-State bureaucracy acting as the "alienating substitute 'public'".</p>
<p>In analysing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a>, Kovel feels that "conspiratorial" revolutionary movements "cut off from the development of society" will "find society an inert mass requiring leadership from above". From this, he notes that the anti-democratic <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Tsarist</a> heritage meant that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bolshevism" title="Bolshevism">Bolsheviks</a>, who were aided into power by <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War One</a>, were a minority who, when faced with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Counter-revolution" title="Counter-revolution">counter-revolution</a> and invading <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">Western</a> powers, continued "the extraordinary needs of '<a href="/wiki/War_communism" title="War communism">war communism</a>'", which "put the seal of <a href="/wiki/Authoritarianism" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a>" on the revolution; thus, for Kovel, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky" title="Leon Trotsky">Trotsky</a> "resorted to terror", shut down the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_(council)" title="Soviet (council)">Soviets</a> (workers' councils) and emulated "capitalist efficiency and <a href="/wiki/Productivism" title="Productivism">productivism</a> as a means of survival", setting the stage for <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a>, in Kovel's eyes, came to oppose the nascent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bolshevism" title="Bolshevism">Bolshevik</a> <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a> and its champion <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aleksandr_Bogdanov" title="Aleksandr Bogdanov">Aleksandr Bogdanov</a>, who was later attacked for "idealism"; Kovel describes <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a>'s philosophy as "a sharply dualistic <a href="/wiki/Materialism" title="Materialism">materialism</a>, rather similar to the <a href="/wiki/Cartesianism" title="Cartesianism">Cartesian</a> separation of matter and consciousness, and perfectly tooled... to the active working over of the dead, dull matter by the human hand", which led him to want to overcome Russian backwardness through rapid <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a>. This tendency was, according to Kovel, augmented by a desire to catch-up with the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">West</a> and the "severe crisis" of the revolution's first years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kovel quotes <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky" title="Leon Trotsky">Trotsky</a>, who believed in a <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communist</a> "superman" who would "learn how to move rivers and mountains". Kovel believes that, in <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a>'s "revolution from above" and mass terror in response to the early 1930s economic crisis, <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky" title="Leon Trotsky">Trotsky</a>'s writings "were given official imprimatur", despite the fact that <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky" title="Leon Trotsky">Trotsky</a> himself was eventually purged, as <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> attacked "the very notion of ecology... in addition to ecologies". Kovel adds that <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a> "would win the gold medal for enmity to nature", and that, in the face of massive <a href="/wiki/Environmental_degradation" title="Environmental degradation">environmental degradation</a>, the inflexible <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> bureaucracy became increasingly inefficient and unable to emulate capitalist accumulation, leading to a "vicious cycle" that led to its collapse.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critique_of_the_wider_socialist_movement">Critique of the wider socialist movement</span></h3>
<p>Beyond the forms of 'actually existing socialism', Kovel criticises <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialists</a> in general as treating ecology "as an afterthought" and holding "a naive faith in the ecological capacities of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> defined by generations of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> production". He exemplifies <a href="/wiki/David_McNally_(professor)" title="David McNally (professor)">David McNally</a>, who advocated increasing consumption levels under socialism, which, for Kovel, contradicts any notion of natural limits. He also criticises McNally's belief in releasing the "positive side of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capital</a>'s self-expansion" after the emancipation of labor; instead, Kovel argues that a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist">socialist</a> society would "seek not to become larger" but would rather become "more <i>realized</i>", choosing sufficiency and eschewing <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a>. Kovel further adds that the <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> movement was historically conditioned by its origins in the era of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a> so that, when modern <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialists</a> like <a href="/wiki/David_McNally_(professor)" title="David McNally (professor)">McNally</a> advocate a socialism that "cannot be at the expense of the range of human satisfaction", they fail "to recognize that these satisfactions can be problematic with respect to nature when they have been historically shaped by the domination of nature".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eco-socialist_strategy">Eco-socialist strategy</span></h2>
<p>Eco-socialists generally advocate the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-violence" title="Non-violence">non-violent</a> dismantling of capitalism and the state, focusing on collective ownership of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> by freely associated producers and restoration of the <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">Commons</a>.

<p>These prefigurative steps go "beyond the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a> and the state" and base production on the enhancement of <a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use values</a>, leading to the internationalization of resistance communities in an 'Eco-socialist Party' or network of grassroots groups focused on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-violence" title="Non-violence">non-violent</a>, radical social transformation. An 'Eco-socialist revolution' is then carried out.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agency">Agency</span></h3>
<p>Many eco-socialists, like Alan Roberts, have encouraged <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> action and resistance, such as the '<a href="/wiki/Green_ban" title="Green ban">green ban</a>' movement in which workers refuse to participate in projects that are ecologically harmful. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> focuses on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> involvement in the formation of eco-socialist parties or their increased involvement in existing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_Parties" title="Green Parties">Green Parties</a>; however, he believes that, unlike many other forms of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> analysis, "there is no privileged agent" or revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a>, and that there is potential for agency in numerous autonomous, grassroots individuals and groups who can build "prefigurative" projects for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-violence" title="Non-violence">non-violent</a> radical social change. He defines "prefiguration" as "the potential for the given to contain the lineaments of what is to be", meaning that "a moment toward the future exists embedded in every point of the social organism where a need arises".</p>
<p>If "everything has prefigurative potential", Kovel notes that forms of potential <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> production will be "scattered", and thus suggests that "the task is to free them and connect them". While all "human <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>" have "ecosocialist potential", Kovel points out that ones such as the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> have low potential, whereas internally democratic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-globalization" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a> "affinity groups" have a high potential through a dialectic that involves the "active bringing and holding together of negations", such as the group acting as an alternative institution ("production of an <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a>/<a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> alternative") and trying to shut down a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/G8" title="G8">G8</a> summit meeting ("resistance to capital"). Therefore, "practices that in the same motion enhance <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a> and diminish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exchange-value" title="Exchange-value">exchange-values</a> are the ideal" for eco-socialists.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prefiguration">Prefiguration</span></h3>
<p>For Kovel, the main prefigurative steps "are that people ruthlessly criticize the capitalist system... and that they include in this a consistent attack on the widespread belief that there can be no alternative to it", which will then "deligitimate the system and release people into struggle". Kovel justifies this by stating that "radical criticism of the given... can be a material force", even without an alternative, "because it can seize the mind of the masses of people", leading to "dynamic" and "exponential", rather than "incremental" and "linear", victories that spread rapidly. Following this, he advocates the expansion of the dialectical eco-socialist potential of groups through sustaining the confrontation and internal cohesion of <a href="/wiki/Human_ecosystem" title="Human ecosystem">human ecosystems</a>, leading to an "activation" of potentials in others that will "spread across the whole social field" as "a new set of orienting principles" that define an ideology or "'party-life' formation".</p>
<p>In the short-term, eco-socialists like Kovel advocate activities that have the "promise of breaking down the commodity form". This includes organizing labor, which is a "reconfiguring of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-value</a> of labor power"; forming <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cooperatives" title="Cooperatives">cooperatives</a>, allowing "a relatively free association of labor"; forming localised currencies, which he sees as "undercutting the value-basis of money"; and supporting "radical media" that, in his eyes, involve an "undoing of the fetishism of commodities". <a href="/wiki/Arran_Gare" title="Arran Gare">Arran Gare</a>, <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a> and Kovel have advocated economic <a href="/wiki/Localism_(politics)" title="Localism (politics)">localisation</a> in the same vein as many in the <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Green movement</a>, although they stress that it must be a prefigurative step rather than an end in itself.</p>
<p>Kovel also advises political parties attempting to "democratize the state" that there should be "dialogue but no compromise" with established political parties, and that there must be "a continual association of electoral work with movement work" to avoid "being sucked back into the system". Such parties, he believes, should focus on "the local rungs of the political system" first, before running national campaigns that "challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises".</p>
<p>Kovel believes in building prefigurations around forms of production based on <a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use values</a>, which will provide a practical vision of a <a href="/wiki/Post-capitalism" title="Post-capitalism">post-capitalist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anti-statism" title="Anti-statism">post-statist</a> system. Such projects include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indymedia" title="Indymedia">Indymedia</a> ("a democratic rendering of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a> of new technologies such as the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>, and a continual involvement in wider struggle"), <a href="/wiki/Open-source_software" title="Open-source software">open-source software</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_libraries" title="Public libraries">public libraries</a> and many other initiatives, especially those developed within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-globalisation_movement" title="Anti-globalisation movement">anti-globalisation movement</a>. These strategies, in <a href="/wiki/Derek_Wall" title="Derek Wall">Wall</a>'s words, "go beyond the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a> and the state" by rejecting the supposed dichotomy between <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">private enterprise</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government-owned_corporation" title="Government-owned corporation">state-owned</a> production, while also rejecting any combination of the two through a <a href="/wiki/Mixed_economy" title="Mixed economy">mixed economy</a>. He states that these present forms of "amphibious politics", which are "half in the dirty water of the present but seeking to move on to a new, unexplored territory".</p>
<p>Wall suggests that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_source_software" title="Open source software">open source software</a>, for example, opens up "a new form of <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a> regime in <a href="/wiki/Cyberspace" title="Cyberspace">cyberspace</a>", which he praises as production "for the pleasure of invention" that gives "access to resources without exchange". He believes that <a href="/wiki/Open_source" title="Open source">open source</a> has "bypassed" both the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a> and the state, and could provide "developing countries with free access to vital computer software". Furthermore, he suggests that an "<a href="/wiki/Open_source" title="Open source">open source</a> economy" means that "the barrier between user and provider is eroded", allowing for "cooperative creativity". He links this to <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and the notion of <a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">usufruct</a>, asserting that "Marx would have been a <a href="/wiki/Firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> user".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internationalization_of_prefiguration_and_the_.27Eco-socialist_Party.27">Internationalization of prefiguration and the 'Eco-socialist Party'</span></h3>
<p>Many eco-socialists have noted that the potential for building such projects is easier for media workers than for those in heavy industry because of the decline in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trade_unionism" title="Trade unionism">trade unionism</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalized</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Division_of_labor" title="Division of labor">division of labor</a> which divides workers. However, Kovel believes that examples like the <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="/wiki/Bruderhof_Communities" title="Bruderhof Communities">Bruderhof Communities</a> (despite elements of <a href="/wiki/Patriarchy" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a> that he attacks) show that "communistic" organizations can "survive rather well in a heavily industrialized <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a>" if they are "protected" from the dependence on the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a> by "<a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> intentionality". He further posits that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_struggle" title="Class struggle">class struggle</a> is "internationalized in the face of globalization", as evidenced by a wave of <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" title="Strike action">strikes</a> across the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a> in the first half of the year 2000; indeed, he says that "labor's most cherished values are already immanently ecocentric".</p>
<p>Kovel therefore thinks that these universalizing tendencies must lead to the formation of "a consciously 'Ecosocialist Party'" that is neither like a parliamentary or vanguardist party. Instead, Kovel advocates a form of <a href="/wiki/Political_party" title="Political party">political party</a> "grounded in communities of resistance", where delegates from these communities form the core of the party's activists, and these delegates and the "open and transparent" assembly they form are subject to <a href="/wiki/Recall_election" title="Recall election">recall</a> and regular rotation of members. He holds up the <a href="/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation" title="Zapatista Army of National Liberation">Zapatista Army of National Liberation</a> (EZLN) and the <a href="/wiki/Gaviotas" title="Gaviotas">Gaviotas</a> movement as examples of such communities, which "are produced outside capitalist circuits" and show that "there can be no single way valid for all peoples".</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he also firmly believes in connecting these movements, stating that "ecosocialism will be international or it will be nothing" and hoping that the Ecosocialist Party can retain the autonomy of local communities while supporting them materially. With an ever-expanding party, Kovel hopes that "defections" by <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalists</a> will occur, leading eventually to the <a href="/wiki/Armed_forces" title="Armed forces">armed forces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a> who, in joining the <a href="/wiki/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, will signify that "the turning point is reached".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id=".27The_Revolution.27_and_transition_to_eco-socialism">'The Revolution' and transition to eco-socialism</span></h2>

<p>'The Revolution' as envisaged by eco-socialists involves an immediate socio-political transition. Internationally, eco-socialists believe in a reform of the nature of <a href="/wiki/Money" title="Money">money</a> and the formation of a 'World People's Trade Organisation' (WPTO) that democratizes and improves world <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> through the calculation of an 'Ecological Price' (EP) for goods. This would then be followed by a transformation of socioeconomic conditions towards ecological production, <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a> land and notions of <a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">usufruct</a> (that seek to improve the common property possessed by society) to end private <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>. Eco-socialists assert that this must be carried out with adherence to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-violence" title="Non-violence">non-violence</a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_immediate_aftermath_of_the_revolution">The immediate aftermath of the revolution</span></h3>
<p>Eco-socialists like <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a> use the term "Eco-socialist revolution" to describe the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those "whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production" (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those "whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capital</a>" (including the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>, advertising executives and more) and "the workers whose activity added surplus value to capitalist commodities".</p>
<p>In terms of political organisation, he advocates an "interim assembly" made up of the revolutionaries that can "devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained" (such as short-term continuation of "differential remuneration" for labor), "handle the redistribution of social roles and assets", convene "in widespread locations", and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an "executive council" that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that "productive communities" will "form the political as well as economic unit of society" and "organize others" to make a transition to eco-socialist production.</p>
<p>He adds that people will be allowed to be members of any community they choose with "associate membership" of others, such as a <a href="/wiki/Physician" title="Physician">doctor</a> having main membership of healthcare communities as a <a href="/wiki/Physician" title="Physician">doctor</a> and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional "supervisory" roles over localities to monitor the development of <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystemic</a> integrity, and administer "society-wide services" like transport in "state-like functions", before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to "the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transnational_trade_and_capital_reform">Transnational trade and capital reform</span></h3>
<p>Part of the eco-socialist transition, in Kovel’s eyes, is the reforming <a href="/wiki/Money" title="Money">money</a> to retain its use in "enabling exchanges" while reducing its functions as "a commodity in its own right" and "repository of value". He argues for directing <a href="/wiki/Money" title="Money">money</a> to "enhancement of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a>" through a "subsidization of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a>" that "preserves the functioning core of the economy while gaining time and space for rebuilding it". Internationally, he believes in the immediate cessation of <a href="/wiki/Speculation" title="Speculation">speculation</a> in <a href="/wiki/Currency" title="Currency">currencies</a> ("breaking down the function of money as commodity, and redirecting funds on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a>"), the cancellation of the debt of the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a> ("breaking the back of the value function" of money) and the redirecting the "vast reservoir of mainly phony value" to reparations and "ecologically sound development". He suggests the end of military aid and other forms of support to "<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Comprador_elites&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Comprador elites (page does not exist)">comprador elites</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">South</a>" will eventually "lead to their collapse".</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a>, Kovel advocates a ‘World People’s Trade Organization’ (WPTO), "responsible to a confederation of popular bodies", in which "the degree of control over <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> is... proportional to involvement with production", meaning that "farmers would have a special say over food trade" and so on. He posits that the WPTO should have an elected council that will oversee a reform of prices in favour of an ‘Ecological Price’ (EP) "determined by the difference between actual <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a> and fully realized ones", thus having low <a href="/wiki/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> for forms of ecological production like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_agriculture" title="Organic agriculture">organic agriculture</a>; he also envisages the high <a href="/wiki/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on non-ecological production providing subsidies to ecological production units.</p>
<p>The EP would also internalize the costs of current <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externalities</a> (like <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>) and "would be set as a function of the distance traded", reducing the effects of long-distance transport like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> and increased <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packaging" title="Packaging">packaging</a> of goods. He thinks that this will provide a "standard of transformation" for non-ecological industries, like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile_industry" title="Automobile industry">automobile industry</a>, thus spurring changes towards ecological production.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecological_production">Ecological production</span></h3>
<p>Eco-socialists pursue "<a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> production" that, according to <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a>, goes beyond the <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> vision of the emancipation of labor to "the realization of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-values</a> and the appropriation of intrinsic value". He envisions a form of production in which "the making of a thing becomes part of the thing made" so that, using a high quality meal as an analogy, "pleasure would obtain for the cooking of the meal" - thus activities "reserved as hobbies under capitalism" would "compose the fabric of everyday life" under eco-socialism.</p>
<p>This, for Kovel, is achieved if labor is "freely chosen and developed... with a fully realized <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-value</a>" achieved by a "negation" of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exchange-value" title="Exchange-value">exchange-value</a>, and he exemplifies the <a href="/wiki/Food_Not_Bombs" title="Food Not Bombs">Food Not Bombs</a> project for adopting this. He believes that the notion of "mutual recognition... for the process as well as the product" will avoid <a href="/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour" title="Exploitation of labour">exploitation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>. With production allowing humanity to "live more directly and receptively embedded in <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>", Kovel predicts that "a reorientation of human need" will occur that recognises <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> limits and sees <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> as "fully participant in the life of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-system" title="Eco-system">eco-systems</a>", thus removing it from profit-making exercises.</p>
<p>In the course on an Eco-socialist revolution, writers like Kovel advocate the a "rapid conversion to ecosocialist production" for all enterprises, followed by "restoring <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystemic</a> integrity to the workplace" through steps like workers ownership. He then believes that the new enterprises can build "socially developed plans" of production for societal needs, such as efficient light-rail transport components. At the same time, Kovel argues for the transformation of essential but, under capitalism, non-productive labour, such as child care, into productive labour, "thereby giving reproductive labour a status equivalent to productive labour".</p>
<p>During such a transition, he believes that income should be guaranteed and that money will still be used under "new conditions of value… according to use and to the degree to which ecosystem integrity is developed and advanced by any particular production". Within this structure, Kovel asserts that markets and will become unnecessary – although "market phenomena" in personal exchanges and other small instances might be adopted – and communities and elected assemblies will democratically decide on the allocation of resources. <a href="/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_M%C3%A9sz%C3%A1ros_(professor)" title="István Mészáros (professor)">Istvan Meszaros</a> believes that such "genuinely planned and self-managed (as opposed to bureaucratically planned from above) productive activities" are essential if eco-socialism is to meet its "fundamental objectives".</p>
<p>Eco-socialists are quick to assert that their focus on "production" does not mean that there will be an increase in production and labor under Eco-socialism. Kovel thinks that the emancipation of labor and the realization of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-value</a> will allow "the spheres of work and culture to be reintegrated". He cites the example of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guarani_people" title="Guarani people">Paraguayan Indian</a> communities (organised by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jesuits" title="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>) in the eighteenth century who made sure that all community members learned musical instruments, and had labourers take musical instruments to the fields and takes turns playing music or harvesting.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Commons.2C_property_and_.27usufruct.27">Commons, property and 'usufruct'</span></h3>
<p>Most eco-socialists, including <a href="/wiki/Ramachandra_Guha" title="Ramachandra Guha">Guha</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Juan_Martinez-Alier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Juan Martinez-Alier (page does not exist)">Martinez-Alier</a>, echo subsistence <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-feminism" title="Eco-feminism">eco-feminists</a> like <a href="/wiki/Vandana_Shiva" title="Vandana Shiva">Vandana Shiva</a> when they argue for the restoration of <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a> land over <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private property</a>. They blame <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> degradation on the inclination to short-term, profit-inspired decisions inherent within a <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a> system. For them, <a href="/wiki/Privatization" title="Privatization">privatization</a> of land strips people of their local communal resources in the name of creating markets for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neo-liberalism" title="Neo-liberalism">neo-liberal globalisation</a>, which benefits a minority. In their view, successful <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a> systems have been set up around the world throughout history to manage areas cooperatively, based on long-term needs and <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a> instead of short-term profit.</p>
<p>Many eco-socialists focus on a modified version of the notion of ‘<a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">Usufruct</a>’ to replace capitalist private <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> arrangements. As a legal term, <a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">Usufruct</a> refers to the legal right to use and derive profit or benefit from <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> that belongs to another person, as long as the property is not damaged. According to eco-socialists like Kovel, a modern interpretation of the idea is "where one uses, enjoys – and through that, improves – another’s property", as its <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> etymology "condenses the two meanings of use – as in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-value</a>, and enjoyment – and as in the gratification expressed in freely associated labour". The idea, according to Kovel, has roots in the <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a> and was first mentioned in <a href="/wiki/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> "where it applied to ambiguities between masters and slaves with respect to property"; it also features in <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islamic</a> <a href="/wiki/Sharia" title="Sharia">Sharia law</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Aztecz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Aztecz (page does not exist)">Aztec</a> law and the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Code" title="Napoleonic Code">Napoleonic Code</a>.</p>
<p>Crucially for eco-socialists, Marx mentioned the idea when he stated that human beings are no more than the planet’s "<a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">usufructaries</a>, and, like <i>boni patres familias</i>, they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition". Kovel and others have taken on this reading, asserting that, in an eco-socialist society, "everyone will have... rights of use and ownership over those means of production necessary to express the creativity of human nature", namely "a place of one’s own" to decorate to personal taste, some personal possessions, the body and its attendant sexual and <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_rights" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a>.</p>
<p>However, Kovel sees <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> as "self-contradictory" because individuals emerge "in a tissue of social relations" and "nested circles", with the self at the centre and extended circles where "issues of sharing arise from early childhood on". He believes that "the full self is enhanced more by giving than by taking" and that eco-socialism is realized when material possessions weigh "lightly" upon the self – thus restoration of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-value</a> allows things to be taken "concretely and sensuously" but "lightly, since things are enjoyed for themselves and not as buttresses for a shaky ego".</p>
<p>This, for Kovel, reverses what Marxists see as the <a href="/wiki/Commodity_fetishism" title="Commodity fetishism">commodity fetishism</a> and atomization of individuals (through the "unappeasable craving" for "having and excluding others from having") under capitalism. Under eco-socialism, he therefore believes that enhancement of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Use-value" title="Use-value">use-value</a> will lead to differentiated ownership between the individual and the collective, where there are "distinct limits on the amount of <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> individuals control" and no-one can take control of resources that "would permit the alienation of <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> from another". He then hopes that the "hubris" of the notion of "ownership of the planet" will be replaced with <a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">usufruct</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-violence">Non-violence</span></h3>
<p>Most eco-socialists are involved in peace and antiwar movements, and eco-socialist writers, like <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel</a>, generally believe that "violence is the rupturing of <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>" and is therefore "deeply contrary to ecosocialist values". Kovel believes that revolutionary movements must prepare for post-revolutionary violence from counter-revolutionary sources by "prior development of the democratic sphere" within the movement, because "to the degree that people are capable of self-government, so will they turn away from violence and retribution" for "a self-governed people cannot be pushed around by any alien government". It is therefore essential, in <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Kovel's</a> view, that the revolution "takes place in" or spreads quickly to the United States, which "is capital's gendarme and will crush any serious threat", and that revolutionaries reject the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_penalty" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> and retribution against former opponents or counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticisms_of_eco-socialism">Criticisms of eco-socialism</span></h2>
<p>While in many ways the criticisms of eco-socialism combine the traditional criticisms of both socialism and Green politics, there are unique critiques of eco-socialism, which are largely from within the traditional <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">Socialist</a> or <a href="/wiki/Green_politics" title="Green politics">Green movements</a> themselves, along with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conservativism" title="Conservativism">conservative</a> criticisms.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialists</a> are critical of the word 'eco-socialism'. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=David_Reilly_(Eco-socialist)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David Reilly (Eco-socialist) (page does not exist)">David Reilly</a>, who questions whether his argument is improved by the use of an "exotic word", argues instead that the "real socialism" is "also a green or 'eco'" one that you get to "by dint of struggle". Other socialists, like <a href="/wiki/Paul_Hampton" title="Paul Hampton">Paul Hampton</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_for_Workers%27_Liberty" title="Alliance for Workers' Liberty">Alliance for Workers' Liberty</a> (a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Third_camp" title="Third camp">third camp socialist</a> party), see eco-socialism as "classless ecology", wherein eco-socialists have "given up on the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a>" as the privileged agent of struggle by "borrowing bits from Marx but missing the locus of Marxist politics".</p>
<p>Writing in <i><a href="/wiki/Capitalism_Nature_Socialism" title="Capitalism Nature Socialism">Capitalism Nature Socialism</a></i>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Doug_Boucher&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Doug Boucher (page does not exist)">Doug Boucher</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Peter_Caplan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Peter Caplan (page does not exist)">Peter Caplan</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_Schwartzman" title="David Schwartzman">David Schwartzman</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Jane_Zara&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jane Zara (page does not exist)">Jane Zara</a> criticise eco-socialists in general (and <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Joel Kovel</a> in particular) for a deterministic "<a href="/wiki/Catastrophism" title="Catastrophism">catastrophism</a>" that overlooks "the countervailing tendencies of both popular struggles and the efforts of capitalist governments to rationalize the system" and the "accomplishments of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_movement" title="Labor movement">labor movement</a>" that "demonstrate that despite the interests and desires of capitalists, progress toward <a href="/wiki/Social_justice" title="Social justice">social justice</a> is possible". They argue that an ecological socialism must be "built on hope, not fear".</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">Conservatives</a> have criticised the perceived opportunism of <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" title="Left-wing politics">left-wing</a> groups who have increased their focus on green issues since the fall of <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fred_L._Smith_(political_writer)" title="Fred L. Smith (political writer)">Fred L. Smith</a> Jr., President of the <a href="/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute" title="Competitive Enterprise Institute">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> think-tank, exemplifies the conservative critique of left Greens, attacking the "<a href="/wiki/Pantheism" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a>" of the Green movement and conflating "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neopaganism" title="Neopaganism">eco-paganism</a>" with eco-socialism. Like many conservative critics, Smith uses the term 'eco-socialism' to attack non-socialist <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalists</a> for advocating restrictions on the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a>, although he does recognise and condemn the influence of socialist ideals on many in the Green movement who reject <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private property</a>, and instead advocates <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">market</a>-based solutions to ecological problems. He nevertheless wrongly claims that eco-socialists endorse "the <a href="/wiki/Malthusianism" title="Malthusianism">Malthusian</a> view of the relationship between man and nature", and states that <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>, a former <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a> <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President of the United States</a> and now a <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> campaigner, is an eco-socialist, despite the fact that <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" title="Al Gore">Gore</a> has never used this term and is not recognised as a such by other followers of either Green politics or socialism.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" title="Conservation movement">conservationists</a> have criticised eco-socialism from within the Green movement. In a review of <a href="/wiki/Joel_Kovel" title="Joel Kovel">Joel Kovel</a>'s <i>The Enemy of Nature</i>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=David_M._Johns&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David M. Johns (page does not exist)">David M. Johns</a> criticises eco-socialism for not offering "suggestions about near term <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" title="Conservation movement">conservation</a> policy" and focusing exclusively on long-term societal transformation. Johns believes that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Species_extinction" title="Species extinction">species extinction</a> "started much earlier" than capitalism and suggests that eco-socialism neglects the fact that an <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> society will need to transcend the destructiveness found in "all large-scale societies". the very tendency that Kovel himself attacks among capitalists and traditional leftists who attempt to reduce nature to "linear" human models. Johns questions whether non-hierarchical social systems can provide for billions of people, and criticises eco-socialists for neglecting issues of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Over-population" title="Over-population">population pressure</a>. Furthermore, Johns describes Kovel's argument that human hierarchy is founded on raiding to steal women as "archaic".</p>
