<p>A <b>wind farm</b> is a group of <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a> in the same location used to produce electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm can also be located offshore.</p>
<p>Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in Germany, China and the United States. For example, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_onshore_wind_farms" title="List of onshore wind farms">largest wind farm in the world</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gansu_Wind_Farm" title="Gansu Wind Farm">Gansu Wind Farm</a> in China has a capacity of over 6,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a> of power in 2012 with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. The <a href="/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center" title="Alta Wind Energy Center">Alta Wind Energy Center</a> in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, United States is the largest onshore wind farm outside of China, with a capacity of 1,020 MW.

<p>As a general rule, economic wind generators require windspeed of 16 km/h (10 mph) or greater. An ideal location would have a near constant flow of non-turbulent wind throughout the year, with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind. An important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">transmission</a> capacity.</p>
<p>Usually sites are screened on the basis of a <a href="/wiki/Wind_atlas" title="Wind atlas">wind atlas</a>, and validated with wind measurements. <a href="/wiki/Meteorology" title="Meteorology">Meteorological</a> wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential in order to finance the project. Local winds are often monitored for a year or more, and detailed wind maps constructed before wind generators are installed.</p>
<p>The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. Typically, the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a <a href="/wiki/Wind_profile_power_law" title="Wind profile power law">wind profile power law</a>, which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude. Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10%, and the expected power by 34%.</p>
<p>In general, a distance of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm, but micrositing optimizes placement, particularly in hilly areas. Individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network. At a <a href="/wiki/Electrical_substation" title="Electrical substation">substation</a>, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a <a href="/wiki/Transformer" title="Transformer">transformer</a> for connection to the high voltage transmission system. Construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation, and possibly access roads to each turbine site.</p>

<p>The world's first wind farm was 0.6 MW, consisting of 20 wind turbines rated at 30 kilowatts each, installed on the shoulder of <a href="/wiki/Crotched_Mountain" title="Crotched Mountain">Crotched Mountain</a> in southern <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> in December 1980.</p>

<p><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/onshore" title="wikt:onshore">Onshore</a> turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridgelines generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline.

The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30m could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.</p>

<p>Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with <a href="/wiki/Vindeby_Offshore_Wind_Farm" title="Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm">the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby)</a> being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Wind_Energy_Association" title="European Wind Energy Association">European Wind Energy Association</a> has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.</p>
<p>As of September 2013, The <a href="/wiki/London_Array" title="London Array">London Array</a> in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 1,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a>, followed by <a href="/wiki/Greater_Gabbard_wind_farm" title="Greater Gabbard wind farm">Greater Gabbard wind farm</a> (504 MW) also in the UK.</p>

<p>Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. <a href="/wiki/Capacity_factor" title="Capacity factor">Capacity factors</a> (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations.</p>
<p>The province of Ontario in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Canada" title="Wind power in Canada">Canada</a> is pursuing several proposed locations in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, including the suspended <a href="/wiki/Trillium_Power_Wind_1" title="Trillium Power Wind 1">Trillium Power Wind 1</a> approximately 20 km from shore and over 400 MW in size. Other Canadian projects include one on the Pacific west coast.</p>
<p>As of 2010, there are no offshore wind farms in the United States. However, projects are under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast; the <a href="/wiki/Block_Island_Wind_Farm" title="Block Island Wind Farm">Block Island Wind Farm</a> is scheduled for 2016.</p>
<p>Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. As of 2015, there are 20 <a href="/wiki/Jackup_rig" title="Jackup rig">jackup vessels</a> for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.</p>

<p>In just five years, China leapfrogged the rest of the world in wind energy production, going from 2,599 MW of capacity in 2006 to 62,733 MW at the end of 2011. However, the rapid growth outpaced China's infrastructure and new construction slowed significantly in 2012.</p>
<p>At the end of 2009, wind power in China accounted for 25.1 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">gigawatts</a> (GW) of electricity generating capacity, and China has identified <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> as a key growth component of the country's economy. With its large land mass and long coastline, China has exceptional wind resources. Researchers from Harvard and <a href="/wiki/Tsinghua_University" title="Tsinghua University">Tsinghua University</a> have found that China could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by 2030.</p>
<p>By the end of 2008, at least 15 Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components. Turbine sizes of 1.5 MW to 3 MW became common. Leading wind power companies in China were <a href="/wiki/Goldwind" title="Goldwind">Goldwind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dongfang_Electric" title="Dongfang Electric">Dongfang Electric</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sinovel" title="Sinovel">Sinovel</a> along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> has a total installed wind capacity of 93,957 MW. Germany has the third largest capacity in the world (after China and the United States) with an installed capacity was 29,060 MW at the end of 2011, and Spain has 21,674 MW. Italy and France each had between 6,000 and 7,000 MW. By January 2014, the UK installed capacity was 10,495 MW. But energy production can be different from capacity – in 2010, Spain had the highest European wind power production with 43 TWh compared to Germany's 35 TWh.</p>

<p>An important limiting factor of wind power is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intermittent_power_source" title="Intermittent power source">variable power</a> generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "<a href="/wiki/European_super_grid" title="European super grid">supergrid</a>" to connect national grids together across <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">western Europe</a>, ranging from Denmark across the southern <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to England and the <a href="/wiki/Celtic_Sea" title="Celtic Sea">Celtic Sea</a> to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in <a href="/wiki/Higueruela" title="Higueruela">Higueruela</a> which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Public perception is that renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming. All of these sources combined only supplied 1.3% of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually.</p>
<p>One of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition. A study has shown "turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development."</p>
<p>Wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites. The viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon, instead falling to the developer. For example, Sturge et al. of the University of Sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular, engineering aspects, specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration, either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development. As energy is the main purpose of wind farms, a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms.</p>

<p>Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">Wind power</a> consumes no fuel, and emits no <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.</p>
<p>There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. The estimated number of bird deaths caused by wind turbines is between 140,000 and 328,000, whereas deaths caused by domestic cats are estimated to be between 1.3 and 4.0 billion birds each year and over 100 million birds are killed each year by impact with windows.

<p>There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for 'Wind Turbine Syndrome', although some suggest further research might still be useful.</p>
<p>A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so. Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans. There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.</p>
<p>In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach.</p>

The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line. The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ground_radar_interference">Ground radar interference</span></h3>

<p>Wind farms can interfere with ground <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a> systems used for <a href="/wiki/Military" title="Military">military</a>, <a href="/wiki/Weather_radar" title="Weather radar">weather</a> and <a href="/wiki/Air_traffic_control" title="Air traffic control">air traffic control</a>. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern. Actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected, as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that. But aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task. The US military is using wind turbines on some bases, including <a href="/wiki/Marine_Corps_Logistics_Base_Barstow" title="Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow">Barstow</a> near the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/R-2508_Special_Use_Airspace_Complex" title="R-2508 Special Use Airspace Complex">radar test facility</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects">Effects</span></h4>
<p>The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning. Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration. Radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 MW of projects in USA.</p>
<p>Some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mitigation">Mitigation</span></h4>
<p>Permanent problem solving include a <i>non-initiation window</i> to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm, and a similar method mitigates the false returns. England's <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_Airport" title="Newcastle Airport">Newcastle Airport</a> is using a short-term mitigation; to "blank" the turbines on the radar map with a software patch. Wind turbine blades using <a href="/wiki/Stealth_technology" title="Stealth technology">stealth technology</a> are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for <a href="/wiki/Aviation" title="Aviation">aviation</a>. As well as stealth windfarms, the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference.</p>
<p>In early 2011, the U.S. government awarded a program to build a radar/wind turbine analysis tool. This tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction, thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system.</p>
<p>A mobile radar system, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77, has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines, and more than 170 TPS-77 radars are in use around the world. In Britain, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77 system was to be installed at Trimingham in Norfolk to remove military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the North Sea. A second TPS-77 was to be installed in the Scottish Borders, overcoming objections to a 48-turbine wind farm at Fallago.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Radio_reception_interference">Radio reception interference</span></h3>
<p>There are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities. Potential solutions include predictive interference modeling as a component of site selection.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture">Agriculture</span></h3>
<p>A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.</p>
<p>In another study an analysis carried out on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corn" title="Corn">corn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soybean" title="Soybean">soybean</a> crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.</p>
