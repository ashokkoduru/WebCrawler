<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1853.E2.80.931997:_Compagnie_G.C3.A9n.C3.A9rale_des_Eaux">1853–1997: Compagnie Générale des Eaux</span></h3>
<p>On 14 December 1853, a water company named <i><a href="/wiki/Compagnie_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_des_Eaux" title="Compagnie Générale des Eaux">Compagnie Générale des Eaux</a></i> (CGE) was created by an Imperial decree of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Napoleon_III_of_France" title="Napoleon III of France">Napoleon III</a>. In 1853, CGE obtained a concession in order to supply water to the public in <a href="/wiki/Lyon" title="Lyon">Lyon</a>, serving in this capacity for over a hundred years. In 1860, it obtained a 50-year concession with the City of Paris.</p>
<p>For a hundred years, Compagnie Générale des Eaux remained largely focused on the water sector. However, following the appointment of <a href="/wiki/Guy_Dejouany" title="Guy Dejouany">Guy Dejouany</a> as <a href="/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> in 1976, CGE extended its activities into other sectors with a series of takeovers. Beginning in 1980, CGE began diversifying its operations from water into waste management, energy, <a href="/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">transport</a> services, and <a href="/wiki/Construction" title="Construction">construction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>. It acquired the "Compagnie Générale d'Entreprises Automobiles" (CGEA), specialized in industrial vehicles, which was later divided into two branches: Connex and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Onyx_Environnement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Onyx Environnement (page does not exist)">Onyx Environnement</a>. CGE then acquired the "Compagnie Générale de Chauffe", and later the Montenay group. The Energy Services division these companies became part of was later (1998) renamed "<a href="/wiki/Dalkia" title="Dalkia">Dalkia</a>".</p>
<p>CGE's expansion into communication commenced with the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Canal%2B" title="Canal+">Canal+</a> in 1983, the first Pay-TV channel in France. This expansion was accelerated after <a href="/wiki/Jean-Marie_Messier" title="Jean-Marie Messier">Jean-Marie Messier</a> succeeded Guy Dejouany on 27 June 1996. In 1996, CGE created <a href="/wiki/Neuf_Cegetel" title="Neuf Cegetel">Cegetel</a> to take advantage of the 1998 deregulation of the French telecommunications market, accelerating the move into the media sector which would culminate in the 2000 demerger into Vivendi Universal and Vivendi Environnement.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vivendi_SA" title="Vivendi SA">Vivendi SA</a></div>
<p>In 1998, <a href="/wiki/Compagnie_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_des_Eaux" title="Compagnie Générale des Eaux">Compagnie Générale des Eaux</a> changed its name to <i>Vivendi</i>, and sold off its property and construction divisions the following year.</p>
<p>Vivendi went on to list on the New York Stock Exchange (as "V"), and in December, announced a major merger with Canal+ and <a href="/wiki/Seagram" title="Seagram">Seagram</a>, the owner of <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> film company, to become <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vivendi_Universal" title="Vivendi Universal">Vivendi Universal</a> and now named Vivendi.</p>
<p>In July 2000, Vivendi spun off the remaining water and waste companies into Vivendi Environnement (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Initial_Public_Offering" title="Initial Public Offering">IPO</a> in Paris in July 2000 and in New York in October 2001), later (2003) renamed Veolia Environnement.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2003_.E2.80.93_present:_Veolia">2003 – present: Veolia</span></h3>
<p>In 2003, Vivendi Environnement became Veolia Environnement. In 2005, the name “Veolia” was established as an umbrella brand for all of the Group’s divisions (water, environmental services, energy services and transport) and a new logo was created.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Antoine Frérot has become the Chairman and the CEO of the Group after succeeding <a href="/wiki/Henri_Proglio" title="Henri Proglio">Henri Proglio</a> who has been appointed CEO of <a href="/wiki/%C3%89lectricit%C3%A9_de_France" title="Électricité de France">Électricité de France</a>. The change has been part of a huge <a href="/wiki/Scandal" title="Scandal">politico-financial scandal</a> in France as Proglio kept executive positions – and subsequent salary – in both companies until public criticism forced him to give up his Veolia revenues.</p>
<p>Its Veolia Water division remains the largest private operator of water services in the world.</p>
<p>In March 2011 the company announced the formation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Veolia_Transdev" title="Veolia Transdev">Veolia Transdev</a>, the result of the combination of its transport subsidiary <a href="/wiki/Veolia_Transport" title="Veolia Transport">Veolia Transport</a> with <a href="/wiki/Transdev" title="Transdev">Transdev</a>, a subsidiary of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caisse_des_D%C3%A9p%C3%B4ts" title="Caisse des Dépôts">Caisse des Dépôts</a>. Veolia Transdev is the world's private-sector leader in sustainable mobility with more than 110,000 employees in 28 countries.</p>
<p>In July 2011, amid disappointing financial results, the company announced the launch of new restructuring plans and redeployment of assets and businesses. In December 2011, Veolia announced a €5bn divestment program over 2012–2013. The company would comprise only three divisions (Water, Environmental Services and Energy Services). The transport businesses Veolia Transdev would be divested.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Transdev" title="Transdev">Transdev</a></div>
<p>Transdev (formerly Veolia Transdev) was formed in 2011 from a merger of <a href="/wiki/Veolia_Transport" title="Veolia Transport">Veolia Transport</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Transdev_(historic)" title="Transdev (historic)">old Transdev</a>, a subsidiary of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caisse_des_D%C3%A9p%C3%B4ts" title="Caisse des Dépôts">Caisse des Dépôts</a>. Currently, Veolia owns 40% of the company's shares. Before the merger, Veolia Transport recorded revenues of €7.863 billion in 2011 (For 2010 : Europe 83%, included France 37.1%, North America 13.2%, Asia-Pacific 3.7%). It employed 101,798 people. It worked with public authorities under public-private partnerships to manage public transit systems (buses, trains, metros, ferries, etc.). On 6 December 2011 Veolia Environment, seeking to reduce debt and focus on its core businesses of water, waste and energy, announced that it will eventually sell its share in Veolia Transdev, within a two-year time frame, by when its own activities will have been reorganized. After this announcement, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, for its part, officially reiterated its commitment to Veolia Transdev and its continued support as a shareholder to the group's development.</p>
<p>In early 2012 it was reported that Cube Infrastructure, a fund controlled by the French bank <a href="/wiki/Natixis" title="Natixis">Natixis</a> (<a href="/wiki/Groupe_BPCE" title="Groupe BPCE">Groupe BPCE</a>), was likely to acquire about half of Veolia's stake in Transdev.

The blast leveled two buildings on the property which were a laboratory and a building that had several 200,000 gallon chemical tanks.

<p>In February 2011 the <a href="/wiki/Tower_Hamlets_London_Borough_Council" title="Tower Hamlets London Borough Council">Tower Hamlets London Borough Council</a> of the London borough of <a href="/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets" title="London Borough of Tower Hamlets">Tower Hamlets</a>, voted to review its position with Veolia and place no further contracts with it, after claiming that Veolia's work for the Israeli government assisted the "continued oppression of the Palestinian people".</p>
<p>The Justice and Peace Commission, part of the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> in England, urged London municipalities to stop doing business with Veolia because of its involvement with illegal settlements. Veolia denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Palestinian human-rights organization <a href="/wiki/Al-Haq" title="Al-Haq">Al-Haq</a> instructed lawyers in the Netherlands to submit a formal objection against the decision of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stadsregio_Arnhem_Nijmegen" title="Stadsregio Arnhem Nijmegen">Stadsregio Arnhem Nijmegen</a>, a municipality, to award a public transport concession to Hermes, the Dutch subsidiary of Veolia Transdev. The objection was based on Veolia’s involvement in what Al-Haq claims are Israel’s violations of international law.</p>
<p>In a 2012 interview with the Israeli press, Veolia's Denis Gasquet, senior executive vice president, admitted that Veolia had been under pressure from pro-Palestinian groups in Europe, particularly over the <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail" title="Jerusalem Light Rail">Jerusalem Light Rail</a>. Parties within Veolia had argued that the group was losing tenders as a result, but Gasquest said he did not know of any tenders lost due to Veolia's activities in <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>. He confirmed Veolia's intention to stay in Israel and occupied Palestine, while exiting the transport business.</p>
<p>On April 1, 2015, the company announced on its website "Veolia closes the sale of its activities in Israel." This was taken by supporters of the BDS (Boycott Divestment and Sanctions) movement to signify a success for their campaigning efforts: "The sale follows a worldwide campaign against the company’s role in illegal Israeli settlements that cost the firm billions of dollars of lost contracts."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unpaid_internships">Unpaid internships</span></h3>
