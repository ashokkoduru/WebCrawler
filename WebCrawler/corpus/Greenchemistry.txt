For the journal, see <a href="/wiki/Green_Chemistry_(journal)" title="Green Chemistry (journal)">Green Chemistry (journal)</a>.</div>
<p><b>Green chemistry</b>, also called <b>sustainable chemistry</b>, is an area of chemistry and chemical engineering focused on the designing of products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. Whereas <a href="/wiki/Environmental_chemistry" title="Environmental chemistry">environmental chemistry</a> focuses on the effects of <a href="/wiki/Pollutant" title="Pollutant">polluting</a> chemicals on nature, green chemistry focuses on technological approaches to preventing <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> and reducing consumption of nonrenewable resources.</p>
<p>Green chemistry overlaps with all subdisciplines of chemistry but with a particular focus on <a href="/wiki/Chemical_synthesis" title="Chemical synthesis">chemical synthesis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Process_chemistry" title="Process chemistry">process chemistry</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chemical_engineering" title="Chemical engineering">chemical engineering</a>, in industrial applications. To a lesser extent, the principles of green chemistry also affect laboratory practices. The overarching goals of green chemistry—namely, more resource-efficient and inherently safer design of molecules, materials, products, and processes—can be pursued in a wide range of contexts.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Green chemistry emerged from a variety of existing ideas and research efforts (such as <a href="/wiki/Atom_economy" title="Atom economy">atom economy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catalysis" title="Catalysis">catalysis</a>) in the period leading up to the 1990s, in the context of increasing attention to problems of chemical pollution and <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource depletion</a>. The development of green chemistry in Europe and the United States was linked to a shift in environmental problem-solving strategies: a movement from <a href="/wiki/Command_and_control_regulation" title="Command and control regulation">command and control regulation</a> and mandated reduction of industrial emissions at the "end of the pipe," toward the active prevention of pollution through the innovative design of production technologies themselves. The set of concepts now recognized as green chemistry coalesced in the mid- to late-1990s, along with broader adoption of the term (which prevailed over competing terms such as "clean" and "sustainable" chemistry).</p>
<p>In the United States, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> played a significant early role in fostering green chemistry through its pollution prevention programs, funding, and professional coordination. At the same time in the United Kingdom, researchers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_York" title="University of York">University of York</a> contributed to the establishment of the Green Chemistry Network within the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Chemistry" title="Royal Society of Chemistry">Royal Society of Chemistry</a>, and the launch of the journal <i><a href="/wiki/Green_Chemistry_(journal)" title="Green Chemistry (journal)">Green Chemistry</a></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Principles">Principles</span></h2>
<p>In 1998, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Anastas" title="Paul Anastas">Paul Anastas</a> (who then directed the Green Chemistry Program at the US EPA) and <a href="/wiki/John_Warner_(chemist)" title="John Warner (chemist)">John C. Warner</a> (then of <a href="/wiki/Polaroid_Corporation" title="Polaroid Corporation">Polaroid Corporation</a>) published a set of principles to guide the practice of green chemistry. The twelve principles address a range of ways to reduce the environmental and health impacts of chemical production, and also indicate research priorities for the development of green chemistry technologies.</p>
<p>The principles cover such concepts as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the design of processes to maximize the amount of raw material that ends up in the product;</li>
<li>the use of renewable material feedstocks and energy sources;</li>
<li>the use of safe, environmentally benign substances, including solvents, whenever possible;</li>
<li>the design of energy efficient processes;</li>
<li>avoiding the production of waste, which is viewed as the ideal form of waste management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>twelve principles of green chemistry</b> are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed.</li>
<li>Synthetic methods should be designed to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product.</li>
<li>Wherever practicable, synthetic methodologies should be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment.</li>
<li>Chemical products should be designed to preserve efficacy of function while reducing toxicity.</li>
<li>The use of auxiliary substances (e.g. solvents, separation agents, etc.) should be made unnecessary wherever possible and innocuous when used.</li>
<li>Energy requirements should be recognized for their environmental and economic impacts and should be minimized. Synthetic methods should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure.</li>
<li>A raw material or feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting wherever technically and economically practicable.</li>
<li>Reduce derivatives – Unnecessary derivatization (blocking group, protection/deprotection, temporary modification) should be avoided whenever possible.</li>
<li>Catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are superior to stoichiometric reagents.</li>
<li>Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their function they do not persist in the environment and break down into innocuous degradation products.</li>
<li>Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to allow for real-time, in-process monitoring and control prior to the formation of hazardous substances.</li>
<li>Substances and the form of a substance used in a chemical process should be chosen to minimize potential for chemical accidents, including releases, explosions, and fires.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trends">Trends</span></h2>
<p>Attempts are being made not only to quantify the <i>greenness</i> of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical_yield" title="Chemical yield">chemical yield</a>, the price of reaction components, safety in handling chemicals, hardware demands, energy profile and ease of product workup and purification. In one quantitative study, the <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">reduction</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nitrobenzene" title="Nitrobenzene">nitrobenzene</a> to <a href="/wiki/Aniline" title="Aniline">aniline</a> receives 64 points out of 100 marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an <a href="/wiki/Amide" title="Amide">amide</a> using <a href="/wiki/Sodium_bis(trimethylsilyl)amide" title="Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide">HMDS</a> is only described as adequate with a combined 32 points.</p>
<p>Green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology. As <a href="/wiki/Nanomaterials" title="Nanomaterials">nanomaterials</a> are developed, the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long-term economic viability.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Green_solvents">Green solvents</span></h3>
<p>Solvents are consumed in large quantities in many chemical syntheses as well as for cleaning and degreasing. Traditional solvents are often toxic or are chlorinated. Green solvents, on the other hand, are generally derived from renewable resources and biodegrade to innocuous, often naturally occurring product.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Synthetic_techniques">Synthetic techniques</span></h3>
<p>Novel or enhanced synthetic techniques can often provide improved environmental performance or enable better adherence to the principles of green chemistry. For example, the 2005 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize for Chemistry">Nobel Prize for Chemistry</a> was awarded, to Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, for the development of the <a href="/wiki/Olefin_metathesis" title="Olefin metathesis">metathesis</a> method in organic synthesis, with explicit reference to its contribution to green chemistry and "smarter production." A 2005 review identified three key developments in green chemistry in the field of <a href="/wiki/Organic_synthesis" title="Organic synthesis">organic synthesis</a>: use of <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_carbon_dioxide" title="Supercritical carbon dioxide">supercritical carbon dioxide</a> as green solvent, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aqueous" title="Aqueous">aqueous</a> <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide" title="Hydrogen peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> for clean <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidations</a> and the use of hydrogen in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asymmetric_synthesis" title="Asymmetric synthesis">asymmetric synthesis</a>. Some further examples of applied green chemistry are <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_water_oxidation" title="Supercritical water oxidation">supercritical water oxidation</a>, <a href="/wiki/On_water_reaction" title="On water reaction">on water reactions</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dry_media_reaction" title="Dry media reaction">dry media reactions</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioengineering" title="Bioengineering">Bioengineering</a> is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shikimate" title="Shikimate">shikimate</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tamiflu" title="Tamiflu">Tamiflu</a> precursor which is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)" title="Fermentation (biochemistry)">fermented</a> by Roche in bacteria. <a href="/wiki/Click_chemistry" title="Click chemistry">Click chemistry</a> is often cited as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry. The concept of 'green pharmacy' has recently been articulated based on similar principles.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Carbon_dioxide_as_blowing_agent">Carbon dioxide as blowing agent</span></h4>
<p>In 1996, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dow_Chemical" title="Dow Chemical">Dow Chemical</a> won the 1996 Greener Reaction Conditions award for their 100% <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> blowing agent for <a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" title="Polystyrene">polystyrene</a> foam production. Polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation. Seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the United States alone. Traditionally, <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">CFC</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a>-depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets, presenting a serious environmental hazard. Flammable, explosive, and, in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements, but they present their own problems. Dow Chemical discovered that <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_carbon_dioxide" title="Supercritical carbon dioxide">supercritical carbon dioxide</a> works equally as well as a blowing agent, without the need for hazardous substances, allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO<sub>2</sub> used in the process is reused from other industries, so the net carbon released from the process is zero.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrazine">Hydrazine</span></h3>
<p>Addressing principle #2 is the Peroxide Process for producing <a href="/wiki/Hydrazine" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a> without cogenerating salt. Hydrazine is traditionally produced by the <a href="/wiki/Olin_Raschig_process" title="Olin Raschig process">Olin Raschig process</a> from <a href="/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite" title="Sodium hypochlorite">sodium hypochlorite</a> (the active ingredient in many <a href="/wiki/Bleach" title="Bleach">bleaches</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>. The net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine:</p>

<p>In the greener <a href="/wiki/Peroxide_process" title="Peroxide process">Peroxide process</a> hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant, the side product being water. The net conversion follows:</p>

<p>Addressing principle #4, this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methyl_ethyl_ketone" title="Methyl ethyl ketone">Methyl ethyl ketone</a> is used as a carrier for the hydrazine, the intermediate ketazide phase separates from the reaction mixture, facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1.2C3-Propanediol">1,3-Propanediol</span></h3>
<p>Addressing principle #7 is a green route to <a href="/wiki/1,3-Propanediol" title="1,3-Propanediol">1,3-propanediol</a>, which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors. It can be produced from renewable precursors via the <a href="/wiki/Bioseparation_of_1,3-propanediol" title="Bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol">bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol</a> using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetically_modified" title="Genetically modified">genetically modified</a> <a href="/wiki/Strain_(biology)" title="Strain (biology)">strain</a> of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/E._coli" title="E. coli">E. coli</a></i>. This <a href="/wiki/Diol" title="Diol">diol</a> is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lactide">Lactide</span></h3>

<p>In 2002, Cargill Dow (now <a href="/wiki/NatureWorks" title="NatureWorks">NatureWorks</a>) won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their improved method for <a href="/wiki/Polymerization" title="Polymerization">polymerization</a> of <a href="/wiki/Polylactic_acid" title="Polylactic acid">polylactic acid</a> . Unfortunately, lactide-base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. <a href="/wiki/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">Lactic acid</a> is produced by fermenting corn and converted to <a href="/wiki/Lactide" title="Lactide">lactide</a>, the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient, tin-catalyzed cyclization. The L,L-lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable <a href="/wiki/Polymer" title="Polymer">polymer</a>, which has some applications including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Textiles" title="Textiles">textiles</a> and apparel, cutlery, and food packaging. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wal-Mart" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> has announced that it is using/will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks, doesn't require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes, and results in a high-quality polymer that is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Recyclable" title="Recyclable">recyclable</a> and compostable.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carpet_tile_backings">Carpet tile backings</span></h3>
<p>In 2003 <a href="/wiki/Shaw_Industries" title="Shaw Industries">Shaw Industries</a> selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, and its ability to be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type, nylon-6 provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production. From its inception, EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance, health, and environmental standpoint. Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through <a href="/wiki/Elutriation" title="Elutriation">elutriation</a>, grinding, and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components, but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified <a href="/wiki/Cradle-to-cradle_design" title="Cradle-to-cradle design">cradle-to-cradle design</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transesterification_of_fats">Transesterification of fats</span></h3>
<p>In 2005, <a href="/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland" title="Archer Daniels Midland">Archer Daniels Midland</a> (ADM) and <a href="/wiki/Novozymes" title="Novozymes">Novozymes</a> won the Greener Synthetic Pathways Award for their <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> interesterification process. In response to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) mandated labeling of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trans-fats" title="Trans-fats"><i>trans</i>-fats</a> on nutritional information by January 1, 2006, Novozymes and ADM worked together to develop a clean, enzymatic process for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interesterification" title="Interesterification">interesterification</a> of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The result is commercially viable products without <i>trans</i>-fats. In addition to the human health benefits of eliminating <i>trans</i>-fats, the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water, prevents vast amounts of byproducts, and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bio-succinic_acid">Bio-succinic acid</span></h3>
<p>In 2011, the Outstanding Green Chemistry Accomplishments by a Small Business Award went to <a href="/wiki/BioAmber_Inc." title="BioAmber Inc.">BioAmber Inc.</a> for integrated production and downstream applications of bio-based <a href="/wiki/Succinic_acid" title="Succinic acid">succinic acid</a>. Succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products. Traditionally, succinic acid is produced from petroleum-based feedstocks. BioAmber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> rather than emitting it.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Laboratory_chemicals">Laboratory chemicals</span></h3>
<p>Several <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> chemicals are controversial from the perspective of Green chemistry. The <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> has created the <a class="external autonumber" href="http://ehs.mit.edu/site/content/green-chemical-alternatives-purchasing-wizard" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> to help identify alternatives. <a href="/wiki/Ethidium_bromide" title="Ethidium bromide">Ethidium bromide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Xylene" title="Xylene">xylene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> have been identified as "worst offenders" which have alternatives. Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes: laboratory-scale reaction and purification methods. In the Pharmaceutical Industry, both GSK and Pfizer have published Solvent Selection Guides for their Drug Discovery chemists.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legislation">Legislation</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_EU">The EU</span></h3>
<p>In 2007, The EU put into place the <a class="external text" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_intro.htm" rel="nofollow">Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction</a> of Chemicals (REACH) program, which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe. This regulation (1907/2006) ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals' hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting/authorising uses of specific substances. ECHA, the EU Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the EU member states.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<p>The U.S. law that governs the majority of industrial chemicals (excluding pesticides, foods, and pharmaceuticals) is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic_Substances_Control_Act" title="Toxic Substances Control Act">Toxic Substances Control Act</a> (TSCA) of 1976. Examining the role of regulatory programs in shaping the development of green chemistry in the United States, analysts have revealed structural flaws and long-standing weaknesses in TSCA; for example, a 2006 report to the California Legislature concludes that TSCA has produced a domestic chemicals market that discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function, price, and performance. Scholars have argued that such market conditions represent a key barrier to the scientific, technical, and commercial success of green chemistry in the U.S., and fundamental policy changes are needed to correct these weaknesses.</p>
<p>Passed in 1990, the <a href="/wiki/Pollution_Prevention_Act_of_1990" title="Pollution Prevention Act of 1990">Pollution Prevention Act</a> helped foster new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing environmental problems before they happen.</p>
<p>In 2008, the State of California approved two laws aiming to encourage green chemistry, launching the <a href="/wiki/California_Green_Chemistry_Initiative" title="California Green Chemistry Initiative">California Green Chemistry Initiative</a>. One of these statutes required California's <a href="/wiki/California_Department_of_Toxic_Substances_Control" title="California Department of Toxic Substances Control">Department of Toxic Substances Control</a> (DTSC) to develop new regulations to prioritize "chemicals of concern" and promote the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The resulting regulations took effect in 2013, initiating DTSC's <i>Safer Consumer Products Program</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Green_Chemistry_Education">Green Chemistry Education</span></h2>
<p>Many institutions offer courses and degrees on Green Chemistry. Examples from across the globe are Denmark's Technical University, and several in the US, e.g. at the Universities of Massachusetts-Boston, Michigan, and Oregon. A masters level course in Green Technology, has been introduced by the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology" title="Institute of Chemical Technology">Institute of Chemical Technology</a>, India. In the UK at the University of York University of Leicester, Department of Chemistry and MRes in Green Chemistry at Imperial College London. In Spain different universities like the Universidad de Jaume I or the Universidad de Navarra, offer Green Chemistry master courses. There are also websites focusing on green chemistry, such as the Michigan Green Chemistry Clearinghouse at <a class="external text" href="https://www.migreenchemistry.org//" rel="nofollow">www.migreenchemistry.org</a>.<br/>
Apart from its Green Chemistry Master courses the Zurich University of Applied Sciences ZHAW presents an exposition and web page "Making chemistry green" for a broader public, illustrating the 12 principles.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Contested_definition">Contested definition</span></h2>
<p>There are ambiguities in the definition of green chemistry, and in how it is understood among broader science, policy, and business communities. Even within chemistry, researchers have used the term "green chemistry" to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner (i.e., the 12 principles). While not all uses of the term are legitimate (see <a href="/wiki/Greenwashing" title="Greenwashing">greenwashing</a>), many are, and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly, the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked (or confused) with related concepts like <a href="/wiki/Green_engineering" title="Green engineering">green engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_design" title="Environmental design">environmental design</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a> in general. The complexity and multifaceted nature of green chemistry makes it difficult to devise clear and simple <a href="/wiki/Green_chemistry_metrics" title="Green chemistry metrics">metrics</a>. As a result, "what is green" is often open to debate.</p>
