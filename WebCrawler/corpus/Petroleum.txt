<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_history">Early history</span></h3>

<p>Petroleum, in one form or another, has been used since ancient times, and is now important across society, including in economy, politics and technology. The rise in importance was due to the invention of the <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a>, the rise in <a href="/wiki/Commercial_aviation" title="Commercial aviation">commercial aviation</a>, and the importance of petroleum to industrial organic chemistry, particularly the synthesis of plastics, fertilizers, solvents, adhesives and pesticides.</p>
<p>More than 4000 years ago, according to <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus" title="Diodorus Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asphalt" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a> was used in the construction of the walls and towers of <a href="/wiki/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>; there were oil pits near <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Ardericca&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ardericca (page does not exist)">Ardericca</a> (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zacynthus" title="Zacynthus">Zacynthus</a>. Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river <a href="/wiki/Issus_(river)" title="Issus (river)">Issus</a>, one of the tributaries of the <a href="/wiki/Euphrates" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. Ancient <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire" title="Achaemenid Empire">Persian</a> <a href="/wiki/Persepolis_Administrative_Archives" title="Persepolis Administrative Archives">tablets</a> indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society. By 347 AD, oil was produced from bamboo-drilled wells in China. Early British explorers to <a href="/wiki/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> documented a flourishing oil extraction industry based in <a href="/wiki/Yenangyaung" title="Yenangyaung">Yenangyaung</a> that, in 1795, had hundreds of hand-dug wells under production. The mythological origins of the oil fields at <a href="/wiki/Yenangyaung" title="Yenangyaung">Yenangyaung</a>, and its hereditary monopoly control by 24 families, indicate very ancient origins.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Merkwiller-Pechelbronn" title="Merkwiller-Pechelbronn">Pechelbronn</a> (Pitch fountain) is said to be the first European site where petroleum has been explored and used. The still active Erdpechquelle, a spring where petroleum appears mixed with water has been used since 1498, e.g. for medical purposes. Oil sands have been mined since the 18th century. </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Wietze" title="Wietze">Wietze</a> in lower Saxony, natural asphalt/bitumen has been explored since the 18th century.  Both in Pechelbronn as in Wietze, the coal industry dominated the petroleum technologies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_history">Modern history</span></h3>
<p>Scottish chemist James Young noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the <a href="/wiki/Riddings" title="Riddings">Riddings</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Colliery" title="Colliery">colliery</a> at <a href="/wiki/Alfreton" title="Alfreton">Alfreton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Derbyshire" title="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. In 1848 Young set up a small business refining the crude oil.</p>
<p>Young eventually succeeded, by distilling <a href="/wiki/Cannel_coal" title="Cannel coal">cannel coal</a> at a low heat, in creating a fluid resembling petroleum, which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.</p>
<p>The production of these oils and solid <a href="/wiki/Paraffin_wax" title="Paraffin wax">paraffin wax</a> from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young &amp; Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney &amp; Co. at <a href="/wiki/Bathgate" title="Bathgate">Bathgate</a> in <a href="/wiki/West_Lothian" title="West Lothian">West Lothian</a> and E. Meldrum &amp; Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works in the world with the first modern oil refinery, using oil extracted from locally mined <a href="/wiki/Torbanite" title="Torbanite">torbanite</a>, shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture <a href="/wiki/Naphtha" title="Naphtha">naphtha</a> and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold until 1856.</p>

<p>The world's first oil refinery was built in 1856 by <a href="/wiki/Ignacy_%C5%81ukasiewicz" title="Ignacy Łukasiewicz">Ignacy Łukasiewicz</a>. His achievements also included the discovery of how to distill kerosene from seep oil, the invention of the modern kerosene lamp (1853), the introduction of the first modern street lamp in Europe (1853), and the construction of the world's first modern oil well (1854).</p>
<p>The demand for petroleum as a fuel for lighting in North America and around the world quickly grew. <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Drake" title="Edwin Drake">Edwin Drake</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Drake_Well" title="Drake Well">1859 well</a> near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is popularly considered the first modern well. Already 1858 <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Georg_Christian_Konrad_Hun%C3%A4us&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Georg Christian Konrad Hunäus (page does not exist)">Georg Christian Konrad Hunäus</a> had found a significant amount of petroleum while drilling for <a href="/wiki/Lignite" title="Lignite">lignite</a> 1858 in <a href="/wiki/Wietze" title="Wietze">Wietze</a>, Germany. Wietze later provided about 80% of the German consumption in the Wilhelminian Era. The production stopped in 1963, but Wietze has hosted a Petroleum Museum since 1970.</p>
<p>Drake's well is probably singled out because it was drilled, not dug; because it used a steam engine; because there was a company associated with it; and because it touched off a major boom. However, there was considerable activity before Drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century. A group directed by Major Alexeyev of the Bakinskii Corps of Mining Engineers hand-drilled a well in the Baku region in 1848. There were engine-drilled wells in West Virginia in the same year as Drake's well. An early commercial well was hand dug in <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a> in 1853, and another in nearby <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a> in 1857. At around the same time the world's first, small, oil refinery was opened at <a href="/wiki/Jas%C5%82o" title="Jasło">Jasło</a> in Poland, with a larger one opened at <a href="/wiki/Ploie%C8%99ti" title="Ploiești">Ploiești</a> in Romania shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have had its annual crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics: 275 tonnes for 1857.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_Canada#Early_origins" title="History of the petroleum industry in Canada">first commercial oil well</a> in Canada became operational in 1858 at <a href="/wiki/Oil_Springs,_Ontario" title="Oil Springs, Ontario">Oil Springs, Ontario</a> (then <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canada_West" title="Canada West">Canada West</a>). Businessman <a href="/wiki/James_Miller_Williams" title="James Miller Williams">James Miller Williams</a> dug several wells between 1855 and 1858 before discovering a rich reserve of oil four metres below ground. Williams extracted 1.5 million litres of crude oil by 1860, refining much of it into kerosene lamp oil. Williams's well became commercially viable a year before Drake's Pennsylvania operation and could be argued to be the first commercial oil well in North America. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an <a href="/wiki/Oil_boom" title="Oil boom">oil boom</a> which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. Advances in drilling continued into 1862 when local driller Shaw reached a depth of 62 metres using the spring-pole drilling method. On January 16, 1862, after an explosion of natural gas Canada's first oil gusher came into production, shooting into the air at a recorded rate of 3,000 barrels per day. By the end of the 19th century the Russian Empire, particularly the <a href="/wiki/Branobel" title="Branobel">Branobel</a> company in <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, had taken the lead in production.</p>
<p>Access to oil was and still is a major factor in several military conflicts of the twentieth century, including <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were <a href="/wiki/Oil_Campaign_chronology_of_World_War_II" title="Oil Campaign chronology of World War II">extensively bombed</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa" title="Operation Barbarossa">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a> included the goal to capture the <a href="/wiki/Petroleum_industry_in_Azerbaijan" title="Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan">Baku oilfields</a>, as it would provide much needed oil-supplies for the German military which was suffering from blockades. Oil exploration in North America during the early 20th century later led to the US becoming the leading producer by mid-century. As petroleum production in the US peaked during the 1960s, however, the United States was surpassed by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Today, about 90 percent of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40 percent of total energy consumption in the United States, but is responsible for only 1 percent of electricity generation. Petroleum's worth as a portable, dense energy source powering the vast majority of vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world's most important <a href="/wiki/Commodity" title="Commodity">commodities</a>. Viability of the oil commodity is controlled by several key parameters, number of vehicles in the world competing for fuel, quantity of oil exported to the world market (<a href="/wiki/Export_Land_Model" title="Export Land Model">Export Land Model</a>), <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Net_Energy_Gain&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Net Energy Gain (page does not exist)">Net Energy Gain</a> (economically useful energy provided minus energy consumed), political stability of oil exporting nations and ability to defend oil supply lines.</p>
<p>The top three oil producing countries are Russia, <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and the United States. About 80 percent of the world's readily accessible reserves are located in the Middle East, with 62.5 percent coming from the Arab 5: <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UAE" title="UAE">UAE</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="/wiki/Qatar" title="Qatar">Qatar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kuwait" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. A large portion of the world's total oil exists as unconventional sources, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitumen" title="Bitumen">bitumen</a> in <a href="/wiki/Athabasca_oil_sands" title="Athabasca oil sands">Canada</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extra_heavy_oil" title="Extra heavy oil">extra heavy oil</a> in <a href="/wiki/Orinoco_Belt" title="Orinoco Belt">Venezuela</a>. While significant volumes of oil are extracted from oil sands, particularly in Canada, logistical and technical hurdles remain, as oil extraction requires large amounts of heat and water, making its net energy content quite low relative to conventional crude oil. Thus, Canada's oil sands are not expected to provide more than a few million barrels per day in the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Composition">Composition</span></h2>
<p>In its strictest sense, petroleum includes only crude oil, but in common usage it includes all liquid, gaseous and solid <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a>. Under surface <a href="/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure" title="Standard conditions for temperature and pressure">pressure and temperature conditions</a>, lighter hydrocarbons <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethane" title="Ethane">ethane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Propane" title="Propane">propane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Butane" title="Butane">butane</a> occur as gases, while <a href="/wiki/Pentane" title="Pentane">pentane</a> and heavier hydrocarbons are in the form of liquids or solids. However, in an underground <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_reservoir" title="Oil reservoir">oil reservoir</a> the proportions of gas, liquid, and solid depend on subsurface conditions and on the <a href="/wiki/Phase_diagram" title="Phase diagram">phase diagram</a> of the petroleum mixture.</p>
<p>An <a href="/wiki/Oil_well" title="Oil well">oil well</a> produces predominantly crude oil, with some natural gas <a href="/wiki/Solubility" title="Solubility">dissolved</a> in it. Because the pressure is lower at the surface than underground, some of the gas will come out of <a href="/wiki/Solution" title="Solution">solution</a> and be recovered (or burned) as <i>associated gas</i> or <i>solution gas</i>. A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas_well" title="Gas well">gas well</a> produces predominantly natural gas. However, because the underground temperature and pressure are higher than at the surface, the gas may contain heavier hydrocarbons such as pentane, <a href="/wiki/Hexane" title="Hexane">hexane</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Heptane" title="Heptane">heptane</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gaseous_state" title="Gaseous state">gaseous state</a>. At surface conditions these will <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Condense" title="Condense">condense</a> out of the gas to form <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_gas_condensate" title="Natural gas condensate">natural gas condensate</a>, often shortened to <i>condensate.</i> Condensate resembles gasoline in appearance and is similar in composition to some <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" title="Volatility (chemistry)">volatile</a> <a href="/wiki/Light_crude_oil" title="Light crude oil">light crude oils</a>.</p>
<p>The proportion of light hydrocarbons in the petroleum mixture varies greatly among different <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_fields" title="Oil fields">oil fields</a>, ranging from as much as 97 percent by weight in the lighter oils to as little as 50 percent in the heavier oils and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitumen" title="Bitumen">bitumens</a>.</p>
<p>The hydrocarbons in crude oil are mostly <a href="/wiki/Alkane" title="Alkane">alkanes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cycloalkane" title="Cycloalkane">cycloalkanes</a> and various <a href="/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon" title="Aromatic hydrocarbon">aromatic hydrocarbons</a>, while the other organic compounds contain <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, and trace amounts of metals such as iron, nickel, copper and <a href="/wiki/Vanadium" title="Vanadium">vanadium</a>. Many oil reservoirs contain live bacteria. The exact molecular composition of crude oil varies widely from formation to formation but the proportion of <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> varies over fairly narrow limits as follows:</p>


<p>Four different types of hydrocarbon molecules appear in crude oil. The relative percentage of each varies from oil to oil, determining the properties of each oil.</p>

<p>Crude oil varies greatly in appearance depending on its composition. It is usually black or dark brown (although it may be yellowish, reddish, or even greenish). In the reservoir it is usually found in association with natural gas, which being lighter forms a "gas cap" over the petroleum, and <a href="/wiki/Saline_water" title="Saline water">saline water</a> which, being heavier than most forms of crude oil, generally sinks beneath it. Crude oil may also be found in a semi-solid form mixed with sand and water, as in the <a href="/wiki/Athabasca_oil_sands" title="Athabasca oil sands">Athabasca oil sands</a> in Canada, where it is usually referred to as crude <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitumen" title="Bitumen">bitumen</a>. In Canada, bitumen is considered a sticky, black, tar-like form of crude oil which is so thick and heavy that it must be heated or diluted before it will flow. Venezuela also has large amounts of oil in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orinoco_oil_sands" title="Orinoco oil sands">Orinoco oil sands</a>, although the hydrocarbons trapped in them are more fluid than in Canada and are usually called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extra_heavy_oil" title="Extra heavy oil">extra heavy oil</a>. These oil sands resources are called <a href="/wiki/Unconventional_oil" title="Unconventional oil">unconventional oil</a> to distinguish them from oil which can be extracted using traditional oil well methods. Between them, Canada and <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> contain an estimated 3.6 trillion barrels (570<span style="margin-left:0.2em">×<span style="margin-left:0.1em">10</span></span><s style="display:none">^</s> m) of bitumen and extra-heavy oil, about twice the volume of the world's reserves of conventional oil.</p>
<p>Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for producing <a href="/wiki/Fuel_oil" title="Fuel oil">fuel oil</a> and gasoline, both important <i>"<a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a>"</i> sources. 84 percent by volume of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other fuel oils, and <a href="/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas" title="Liquefied petroleum gas">liquefied petroleum gas</a>. The lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and medium oil are depleted, <a href="/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a> are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using <a href="/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking" title="Fluid catalytic cracking">fluid catalytic cracking</a> to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.</p>
<p>Due to its high <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a>, easy transportability and <a href="/wiki/Oil_reserves" title="Oil reserves">relative abundance</a>, oil has become the world's most important source of energy since the mid-1950s. Petroleum is also the raw material for many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> products, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceuticals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a>, and plastics; the 16 percent not used for energy production is converted into these other materials.

At the heavier end of the range, <a href="/wiki/Paraffin_wax" title="Paraffin wax">paraffin wax</a> is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while <a href="/wiki/Asphalt" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a> has 35 and up, although these are usually <a href="/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking" title="Fluid catalytic cracking">cracked</a> by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand and the cost of recovery, these gases are either <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flare_stack" title="Flare stack">flared off</a>, sold as <a href="/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas" title="Liquefied petroleum gas">liquefied petroleum gas</a> under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapor pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, but it is also a main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.</p>
<p>The <i>cycloalkanes</i>, also known as <i>naphthenes</i>, are saturated hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.</p>
<p>The <i>aromatic hydrocarbons</i> are <a href="/wiki/Degree_of_unsaturation" title="Degree of unsaturation">unsaturated hydrocarbons</a> which have one or more planar six-carbon rings called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Benzene_ring" title="Benzene ring">benzene rings</a>, to which hydrogen atoms are attached with the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-6</sub>. They tend to burn with a sooty flame, and many have a sweet aroma. Some are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carcinogenic" title="Carcinogenic">carcinogenic</a>.</p>
<p>These different molecules are separated by <a href="/wiki/Fractional_distillation" title="Fractional distillation">fractional distillation</a> at an oil refinery to produce gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and other hydrocarbons. For example, <a href="/wiki/2,2,4-Trimethylpentane" title="2,2,4-Trimethylpentane">2,2,4-trimethylpentane</a> (isooctane), widely used in gasoline, has a chemical formula of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> and it reacts with oxygen <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exothermic" title="Exothermic">exothermically</a>:</p>

<p>The number of various molecules in an oil sample can be determined by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a>, then separated in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas_chromatograph" title="Gas chromatograph">gas chromatograph</a>, and finally determined with a suitable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Detector" title="Detector">detector</a>, such as a <a href="/wiki/Flame_ionization_detector" title="Flame ionization detector">flame ionization detector</a> or a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mass_spectrometer" title="Mass spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a>. Due to the large number of co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This <a href="/wiki/Unresolved_complex_mixture" title="Unresolved complex mixture">unresolved complex mixture</a> (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil.</p>
<p>Incomplete combustion of petroleum or gasoline results in production of toxic byproducts. Too little oxygen results in <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Formation">Formation</span></h2>

<p>Petroleum is a <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> derived from ancient <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossilized" title="Fossilized">fossilized</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_material" title="Organic material">organic materials</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a>. Vast quantities of these remains settled to sea or lake bottoms, mixing with sediments and being buried under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anoxic_sea_water" title="Anoxic sea water">anoxic conditions</a>. As further layers settled to the sea or lake bed, intense heat and pressure build up in the lower regions. This process caused the organic matter to change, first into a waxy material known as <a href="/wiki/Kerogen" title="Kerogen">kerogen</a>, which is found in various <a href="/wiki/Oil_shale" title="Oil shale">oil shales</a> around the world, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons via a process known as <a href="/wiki/Catagenesis_(geology)" title="Catagenesis (geology)">catagenesis</a>. Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon <a href="/wiki/Pyrolysis" title="Pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a> in a variety of mainly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Endothermic" title="Endothermic">endothermic</a> reactions at high temperature and/or pressure.</p>
<p>There were certain warm nutrient-rich environments such as the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and the ancient <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tethys_Sea" title="Tethys Sea">Tethys Sea</a> where the large amounts of organic material falling to the ocean floor exceeded the rate at which it could decompose. This resulted in large masses of organic material being buried under subsequent deposits such as shale formed from mud. This massive organic deposit later became heated and transformed under pressure into oil.</p>
<p>Geologists often refer to the temperature range in which oil forms as an "oil window"—below the minimum temperature oil remains trapped in the form of kerogen, and above the maximum temperature the oil is converted to natural gas through the process of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_cracking" title="Thermal cracking">thermal cracking</a>. Sometimes, oil formed at extreme depths may migrate and become trapped at a much shallower level. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Athabasca_Oil_Sands" title="Athabasca Oil Sands">Athabasca Oil Sands</a> are one example of this.</p>
<p>An alternative mechanism was proposed by Russian scientists in the mid-1850s, the hypothesis of <a href="/wiki/Abiogenic_petroleum_origin" title="Abiogenic petroleum origin">abiogenic petroleum origin</a>, but this is contradicted by geological and <a href="/wiki/Geochemistry" title="Geochemistry">geochemical</a> evidence.</p>
<p>Abiogenic (formed by inorganic means) sources of oil have been found, but never in commercially profitable amounts. The controversy isn't over whether abiogenic oil reserves exist, said Larry Nation of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The controversy is over how much they contribute to Earth's overall reserves and how much time and effort geologists should devote to seeking them out.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reservoirs">Reservoirs</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crude_oil_reservoirs">Crude oil reservoirs</span></h3>


<p>Three conditions must be present for oil reservoirs to form: a <a href="/wiki/Source_rock" title="Source rock">source rock</a> rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat to cook it into oil, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Porous" title="Porous">porous</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Permeability_(fluid)" title="Permeability (fluid)">permeable</a> reservoir rock for it to accumulate in, and a cap rock (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_reservoir" title="Oil reservoir">reservoirs</a>) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an <a href="/wiki/Oil_field" title="Oil field">oil field</a> forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by <a href="/wiki/Drill" title="Drill">drilling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pump" title="Pump">pumping</a>.</p>
<p>The reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions. The latter set is regularly used in <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> plants and <a href="/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a>.</p>
<p>Wells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil. "Natural lift" production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, such as in the Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using "<a href="/wiki/Artificial_lift" title="Artificial lift">artificial lift</a>" means. Over time, these "primary" methods become less effective and "secondary" production methods may be used. A common secondary method is <a href="/wiki/Water_injection_(oil_production)" title="Water injection (oil production)">"waterflood"</a> or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or "wellbore." Eventually "tertiary" or "enhanced" oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or "bitumen") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using "in-situ" methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping out the oil-saturated liquid.</p>

<p>Oil-eating bacteria <a href="/wiki/Biodegradation" title="Biodegradation">biodegrade</a> oil that has escaped to the surface. <a href="/wiki/Oil_sands" title="Oil sands">Oil sands</a> are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present—more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or extra-heavy crude oil in <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_shales" title="Oil shales">oil shales</a> are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil. Technically speaking, oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil, but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called <a href="/wiki/Kerogen" title="Kerogen">kerogen</a>. The kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes. The method has been known for centuries and was patented in 1694 under British Crown Patent No. 330 covering, "A way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tar, and oil out of a sort of stone." Although oil shales are found in many countries, the United States has the world's largest deposits.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Petroleum_industry" title="Petroleum industry">petroleum industry</a> generally classifies crude oil by the geographic location it is produced in (e.g. <a href="/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate" title="West Texas Intermediate">West Texas Intermediate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brent_oilfield" title="Brent oilfield">Brent</a>, or <a href="/wiki/DME_Oman_Crude_Oil_Futures_Contract" title="DME Oman Crude Oil Futures Contract">Oman</a>), its <a href="/wiki/API_gravity" title="API gravity">API gravity</a> (an oil industry measure of density), and its sulfur content. Crude oil may be considered <i><a href="/wiki/Light_crude_oil" title="Light crude oil">light</a></i> if it has low density or <i><a href="/wiki/Heavy_crude_oil" title="Heavy crude oil">heavy</a></i> if it has high density; and it may be referred to as <a href="/wiki/Sweet_crude_oil" title="Sweet crude oil">sweet</a> if it contains relatively little sulfur or <i><a href="/wiki/Sour_crude_oil" title="Sour crude oil">sour</a></i> if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur.</p>
<p>The geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery. <i>Light</i> crude oil is more desirable than <i>heavy</i> oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while <i>sweet</i> oil commands a higher price than <i>sour</i> oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries.

<p>Because petroleum is a naturally occurring substance, its presence in the environment need not be the result of human causes such as accidents and routine activities (<a href="/wiki/Seismology" title="Seismology">seismic</a> exploration, <a href="/wiki/Boring_(earth)" title="Boring (earth)">drilling</a>, extraction, refining and combustion).

Regardless of source, petroleum's effects when released into the environment are similar.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ocean_acidification">Ocean acidification</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Ocean_acidification" title="Ocean acidification">Ocean acidification</a> is the increase in the acidity of the Earth's oceans caused by the uptake of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

<p>When burned, petroleum releases carbon dioxide, a <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a>. Along with the burning of coal, petroleum combustion may be the largest contributor to the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has risen over the last 150 years to current levels of over 390 <a href="/wiki/Parts-per_notation" title="Parts-per notation">ppmv</a>, from the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere#Past_variation" title="Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere">180 – 300 ppmv of the prior 800 thousand years</a> This rise in temperature may have reduced the <a href="/wiki/Arctic_ice_pack" title="Arctic ice pack">Arctic ice cap</a> to 1,100,000 sq mi (2,800,000 km), smaller than ever recorded. Because of this melt, more oil reserves have been revealed. It is estimated by the International Energy Agency that about 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil resides in the Arctic.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Extraction">Extraction</span></h3>
<p>Oil extraction is simply the removal of oil from the reservoir (oil pool).

<p>Crude oil and refined fuel <a href="/wiki/Oil_spill" title="Oil spill">spills</a> from <a href="/wiki/Tanker_(ship)" title="Tanker (ship)">tanker ship</a> accidents have damaged natural <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> in <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galapagos_Islands" title="Galapagos Islands">Galapagos Islands</a>, France and many <a href="/wiki/List_of_oil_spills" title="List of oil spills">other places</a>.</p>
<p>The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bp_oil_spill" title="Bp oil spill">Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atlantic_Empress" title="Atlantic Empress">Atlantic Empress</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amoco_Cadiz" title="Amoco Cadiz">Amoco Cadiz</a>). Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the <a href="/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill" title="Exxon Valdez oil spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a></p>
<p>Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_slick" title="Oil slick">oil slick</a> which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bulldozed" title="Bulldozed">bulldozed</a> around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.</p>
<p>Control of oil spills is difficult, requires ad hoc methods, and often a large amount of manpower. The dropping of bombs and incendiary devices from aircraft on the <a href="/wiki/SS_Torrey_Canyon" title="SS Torrey Canyon">SS <i>Torrey Canyon</i></a> wreck produced poor results; modern techniques would include pumping the oil from the wreck, like in the <a href="/wiki/Prestige_oil_spill" title="Prestige oil spill">Prestige oil spill</a> or the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Erika_(tanker)" title="Erika (tanker)">Erika</a> oil spill.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Future_of_petroleum_production">Future of petroleum production</span></h2>

<p>Consumption in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by automobile growth; the <a href="/wiki/1980s_oil_glut" title="1980s oil glut">1985–2003 oil glut</a> even fueled the sales of low economy vehicles in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> countries. The 2008 economic crisis seems to have had some impact on the sales of such vehicles; still, the 2008 oil consumption shows a small increase. In 2016 however Goldman Sachs predicts lower demand due to emerging economies concerns, especially China. The <a href="/wiki/BRICS" title="BRICS">BRICS</a> (Brasil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries might also kick in, as China briefly was the first automobile market in December 2009. The immediate outlook still hints upwards. In the long term, uncertainties linger; the <a href="/wiki/OPEC" title="OPEC">OPEC</a> believes that the OECD countries will push low consumption policies at some point in the future; when that happens, it will definitely curb oil sales, and both OPEC and <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">EIA</a> kept lowering their 2020 consumption estimates during the past 5 years. Oil products are more and more in competition with alternative sources, mainly coal and natural gas, both cheaper sources. Production will also face an increasingly complex situation; while OPEC countries still have large reserves at low production prices, newly found reservoirs often lead to higher prices; offshore giants such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tupi_oil_field" title="Tupi oil field">Tupi</a>, Guara and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tiber_oilfield" title="Tiber oilfield">Tiber</a> demand high investments and ever-increasing technological abilities. Subsalt reservoirs such as Tupi were unknown in the twentieth century, mainly because the industry was unable to probe them. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enhanced_Oil_Recovery" title="Enhanced Oil Recovery">Enhanced Oil Recovery</a> (EOR) techniques (example: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Daqing_Field" title="Daqing Field">DaQing</a>, China ) will continue to play a major role in increasing the world's recoverable oil. The reach of available petroleum ressources has always been around 35 years or even less since the start of the modern exploration. The <a href="/wiki/Oil_constant" title="Oil constant">oil constant</a>, a insider pun in the German industry refers to that effect.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Peak_oil">Peak oil</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">Peak oil</a></div>

<p>Peak oil is the projection that future petroleum production (whether for individual oil wells, entire oil fields, whole countries, or worldwide production) will eventually peak and then decline at a similar rate to the rate of increase before the peak as these reserves are exhausted. The peak of oil discoveries was in 1965, and oil production per year has surpassed oil discoveries every year since 1980. However, this does not mean that potential oil production has surpassed oil demand.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marion_King_Hubbert" title="Marion King Hubbert">Hubbert</a> applied his theory to accurately predict the peak of U.S. conventional oil production at a date between 1966 and 1970. This prediction was based on data available at the time of his publication in 1956. In the same paper, Hubbert predicts world peak oil in "half a century" after his publication, which would be 2006.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict the oil peak in any given region, due to the lack of knowledge and/or transparency in accounting of global oil reserves. Based on available production data, proponents have previously predicted the peak for the world to be in years 1989, 1995, or 1995–2000. Some of these predictions date from before the recession of the early 1980s, and the consequent reduction in global consumption, the effect of which was to delay the date of any peak by several years. Just as the 1971 U.S. peak in oil production was only clearly recognized after the fact, a peak in world production will be difficult to discern until production clearly drops off. The peak is also a moving target as it is now measured as "liquids", which includes synthetic fuels, instead of just conventional oil.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) said in 2010 that production of conventional crude oil had peaked in 2006 at 70 MBBL/d, then flattened at 68 or 69 thereafter. Since virtually all economic sectors rely heavily on petroleum, <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>, if it were to occur, could lead to a "partial or complete failure of markets". In the mid-2000s, widespread fears of an imminent peak led to the "peak oil movement," in which over one hundred thousand Americans prepared, individually and collectively, for the "post-carbon" future.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unconventional_production">Unconventional production</span></h3>
<p>The calculus for peak oil has changed with the introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of <a href="/wiki/Directional_drilling" title="Directional drilling">horizontal drilling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing" title="Hydraulic fracturing">hydraulic fracturing</a> has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production is one of the reasons behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Strata" title="Strata">strata</a> contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. Horizontal drilling, extending horizontally through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore.</p>
