<p><b>Smog</b> is a type of air <a href="/wiki/Pollutant" title="Pollutant">pollutant</a>. The word "smog" was coined in the early 20th century as a <a href="/wiki/Portmanteau" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of the words <a href="/wiki/Smoke" title="Smoke">smoke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a> to refer to smoky fog, its opacity, and odour. The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as <a href="/wiki/Pea_soup_fog" title="Pea soup fog">pea soup fog</a>, a familiar and serious problem in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> from the 19th century to the mid 20th century. This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, ozone, smoke or particulates among others (less visible pollutants include carbon monoxide, CFCs and radioactive sources). Man-made smog is derived from coal emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions.</p>
<p>Modern smog, as found for example in Los Angeles is a type of <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> derived from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vehicular_emission" title="Vehicular emission">vehicular emission</a> from <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engines</a> and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photochemical_smog" title="Photochemical smog">photochemical smog</a>. In certain other cities, such as <a href="/wiki/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, smog severity is often aggravated by <a href="/wiki/Stubble_burning" title="Stubble burning">stubble burning</a> in neighboring agricultural areas. The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are increased by <a href="/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)" title="Inversion (meteorology)">inversion</a> that traps pollution close to the ground. It is usually highly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a> to humans and can cause severe sickness, shortened life or death.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>Coinage of the term "smog" is generally attributed to <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Henry_Antoine_Des_Voeux&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Henry Antoine Des Voeux (page does not exist)">Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux</a> in his 1905 paper, "Fog and Smoke" for a meeting of the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Public_Health_Congress&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Public Health Congress (page does not exist)">Public Health Congress</a>. The July 26, 1905 edition of the London newspaper <i>Daily Graphic</i> quoted Des Voeux, "He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as 'smog.'" The following day the newspaper stated that "Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog." However, this is predated by a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article of January 19, 1893, in which the word is attributed to "a witty English writer."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes">Causes</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coal">Coal</span></h3>
<p>Coal fires, used to heat individual buildings or in a power-producing plant, can emit significant clouds of smoke that contributes to smog. Air pollution from this source has been reported in England since the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. London, in particular, was notorious up through the mid-20th century for its coal-caused smogs, which were nicknamed '<a href="/wiki/Pea_soup_fog" title="Pea soup fog">pea-soupers</a>.' Air pollution of this type is still a problem in areas that generate significant smoke from burning coal, as witnessed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2013_Harbin_smog" title="2013 Harbin smog">2013 autumnal smog in Harbin, China</a>, which closed roads, schools, and the airport.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transportation_emissions">Transportation emissions</span></h3>
<p>Traffic emissions – such as from <a href="/wiki/Truck" title="Truck">trucks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bus" title="Bus">buses</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobiles</a> – also contribute. Airborne <a href="/wiki/By-product" title="By-product">by-products</a> from vehicle <a href="/wiki/Exhaust_system" title="Exhaust system">exhaust systems</a> cause <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities.</p>
<p>The major culprits from transportation sources are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO and NO<sub>x</sub>), volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons. (Hydrocarbons are the main components of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Petroleum_fuels" title="Petroleum fuels">petroleum fuels</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel fuel</a>.) These molecules react with sunlight, heat, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, moisture, and other compounds to form the noxious vapors, ground level <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a>, and particles that comprise smog.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Photochemical_smog">Photochemical smog</span></h3>
<p>Photochemical smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides" title="Nitrogen oxides">nitrogen oxides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound" title="Volatile organic compound">volatile organic compounds</a> in the atmosphere, which leaves <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_particulate_matter" title="Atmospheric particulate matter">airborne particles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tropospheric_ozone" title="Tropospheric ozone">ground-level ozone</a>. This noxious mixture of air pollutants may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aldehydes" title="Aldehydes">Aldehydes</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" title="Nitrogen oxide">Nitrogen oxides</a>, particularly <a href="/wiki/Nitric_oxide" title="Nitric oxide">nitric oxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" title="Nitrogen dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a></li>

<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">Volatile organic compounds</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A primary pollutant is an air pollutant emitted directly from a source. A secondary pollutant is not directly emitted as such, but forms when other pollutants (primary pollutants) react in the atmosphere. Examples of a secondary pollutant include ozone, which is formed when hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) combine in the presence of sunlight; nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), which is formed as nitric oxide (NO) combines with oxygen in the air; and acid rain, which is formed when sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides react with water. All of these harsh chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.</p>
<p>The link between automotive exhaust and photochemical smog was discovered in the 1950s by <a href="/wiki/Arie_Jan_Haagen-Smit" title="Arie Jan Haagen-Smit">Arie Haagen-Smit</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_causes">Natural causes</span></h3>
<p>An erupting volcano can also emit high levels of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sulphur_dioxide" title="Sulphur dioxide">sulphur dioxide</a> along with a large quantity of particulate matter; two key components to the creation of smog. However, the smog created as a result of a volcanic eruption is often known as <a href="/wiki/Vog" title="Vog">vog</a> to distinguish it as a natural occurrence.</p>
<p>The radiocarbon content of some plant life has been linked to the distribution of smog in some areas. For example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Creosote_bush" title="Creosote bush">creosote bush</a> in the Los Angeles area has been shown to have an effect on smog distribution that is more than fossil fuel combustion alone.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h2>

<p>Smog is a serious problem in many cities and continues to harm human health. <a href="/wiki/Tropospheric_ozone" title="Tropospheric ozone">Ground-level ozone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" title="Nitrogen dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emphysema" title="Emphysema">emphysema</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bronchitis" title="Bronchitis">bronchitis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a>. It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs' working capacity, cause shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body's ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness. Hospital admissions and respiratory deaths often increase during periods when ozone levels are high.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">U.S. EPA</a> has developed an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_Quality_Index" title="Air Quality Index">Air Quality Index</a> to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. 8 hour average ozone concentrations of 85 to 104 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_notation" title="Parts per notation">ppbv</a> are described as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups", 105 ppbv to 124 ppbv as "unhealthy" and 125 ppb to 404 ppb as "very unhealthy". The "very unhealthy" range for some other pollutants are: 355 μg m - 424 μg m for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PM10" title="PM10">PM10</a>; 15.5 ppm - 30.4ppm for CO and 0.65 ppm - 1.24 ppm for NO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Smog can form in almost any climate where industries or cities release large amounts of <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>, such as smoke or gases. However, it is worse during periods of warmer, sunnier weather when the upper air is warm enough to inhibit vertical circulation. It is especially prevalent in geologic basins encircled by hills or mountains. It often stays for an extended period of time over densely populated cities or urban areas, and can build up to dangerous levels.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_Delhi" title="Environmental issues in Delhi">Environmental issues in Delhi</a></div>

<p>Delhi is the most polluted city in the world and according to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year. During 2013-14, peak levels of fine <a href="/wiki/Particle" title="Particle">particulate</a> matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PM2.5" title="PM2.5">PM2.5</a> considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Rising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women. The dense smog in Delhi during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year. According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.</p>

<p>Environmentalists have criticised the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues. Most of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it. Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution – Delhi has the third highest quantity of trees among Indian cities and the <a href="/wiki/Delhi_Transport_Corporation" title="Delhi Transport Corporation">Delhi Transport Corporation</a> operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly <a href="/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas" title="Compressed natural gas">compressed natural gas</a> (CNG) buses. In 1996, the <a href="/wiki/Centre_for_Science_and_Environment" title="Centre for Science and Environment">Centre for Science and Environment</a> (CSE) started a public interest litigation in the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India" title="Supreme Court of India">Supreme Court of India</a> that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on CNG and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">United States Department of Energy</a>'s first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its "bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives". The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.</p>
<p>However, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to <a href="/wiki/Stubble_burning" title="Stubble burning">stubble burning</a>, rise in market share of <a href="/wiki/Diesel_exhaust" title="Diesel exhaust">diesel cars</a> and a considerable decline in bus ridership. According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi. The state government of adjoining Uttar Pradesh is considering imposing a ban on crop burning to reduce pollution in Delhi NCR and an environmental panel has appealed to India's Supreme Court to impose a 30% cess on diesel cars.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="London">London</span></h4>

<p>In 1306, concerns over air pollution were sufficient for <a href="/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a> to (briefly) ban coal fires in London. In 1661, <a href="/wiki/John_Evelyn" title="John Evelyn">John Evelyn</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Fumifugium" title="Fumifugium">Fumifugium</a></i> suggested burning fragrant wood instead of mineral coal, which he believed would reduce coughing. The "<a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ballad_of_Gresham_College" title="s:Ballad of Gresham College">Ballad of Gresham College</a>" the same year describes how the smoke "does our lungs and spirits choke, Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron."</p>
<p>Severe episodes of smog continued in the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly in the winter, and were nicknamed "pea-soupers," from the phrase "as thick as pea soup." The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Smog_of_1952" title="Great Smog of 1952">Great Smog of 1952</a> darkened the streets of London and killed approximately 4,000 people in the short time of 4 days (a further 8,000 died from its effects in the following weeks and months). Initially a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flu" title="Flu">flu</a> <a href="/wiki/Epidemic" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a> was blamed for the loss of life.</p>
<p>In 1956 the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956" title="Clean Air Act 1956">Clean Air Act</a> started legally enforcing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smokeless_zone" title="Smokeless zone">smokeless zones</a> in the capital. There were areas where no soft coal was allowed to be burned in homes or in businesses, only <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a>, which produces no smoke. Because of the smokeless zones, reduced levels of sooty particulates eliminated the intense and persistent London smog.</p>
<p>It was after this that the great clean-up of London began. One by one, historical buildings which, during the previous two centuries had gradually completely blackened externally, had their stone facades cleaned and restored to their original appearance. Victorian buildings whose appearance changed dramatically after cleaning included the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Museum_of_Natural_History" title="British Museum of Natural History">British Museum of Natural History</a>. A more recent example was the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>, which was cleaned in the 1980s. A notable exception to the restoration trend was <a href="/wiki/10_Downing_Street" title="10 Downing Street">10 Downing Street</a>, whose bricks upon cleaning in the late 1950s proved to be naturally <i>yellow</i>; the smog-derived black colour of the façade was considered so iconic that the bricks were painted black to preserve the image. Smog caused by traffic pollution, however, does still occur in modern London.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_areas">Other areas</span></h4>
<p>Other areas of the United Kingdom were affected by smog, especially heavily industrialised areas.</p>
<p>The cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, in Scotland, suffered smoke-laden fogs in 1909. Des Voeux, commonly credited with creating the "smog" moniker, presented a paper in 1911 to the Manchester Conference of the Smoke Abatement League of Great Britain about the fogs and resulting deaths.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Santiago.2C_Chile">Santiago, Chile</span></h3>

<p>In December 2005, schools and public offices had to close in <a href="/wiki/Tehran" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>, Iran and 1600 people were taken to hospital, in a severe smog blamed largely on unfiltered car exhaust.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>



<p>Smog was brought to the attention of the general US public in 1933 with the publication of the book "Stop That Smoke", by Henry Obermeyer, a New York public utility official, in which he pointed out the effect on human life and even the destruction of 3,000 acres (12 km) of a farmer's spinach crop. Since then, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> has designated over 300 U.S. counties to be non-attainment areas for one or more pollutants tracked as part of the <a href="/wiki/National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards" title="National Ambient Air Quality Standards">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a>. These areas are largely clustered around large metropolitan areas, with the largest contiguous non-attainment zones in California and the Northeast. Various U.S. and Canadian government agencies collaborate to produce real-time air quality maps and forecasts.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Los_Angeles_and_the_San_Joaquin_Valley">Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley</span></h4>
<p>Because of their locations in low basins surrounded by mountains, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and the <a href="/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley" title="San Joaquin Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a> are notorious for their smog. The millions of vehicles in these regions combined with the additional effects of the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and Los Angeles/<a href="/wiki/Long_Beach,_California" title="Long Beach, California">Long Beach</a> port complexes frequently contribute to further air pollution.</p>
<p>Los Angeles in particular is strongly predisposed to accumulation of smog, because of peculiarities of its geography and weather patterns. Los Angeles is situated in a flat basin with ocean on one side and mountain ranges on three sides. A nearby cold ocean current depresses surface air temperatures in the area, resulting in an <a href="/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)" title="Inversion (meteorology)">inversion layer</a>: a phenomenon where air temperature increases, instead of decreasing, with altitude, suppressing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermals" title="Thermals">thermals</a> and restricting vertical convection. All taken together, this results in a relatively thin, enclosed layer of air above the city that cannot easily escape out of the basin and tends to accumulate pollution.</p>
<p>Though Los Angeles was one of the best known cities suffering from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that <i>Los Angeles</i> was a synonym for <i>smog</i>, strict regulations by government agencies overseeing this problem, including tight restrictions on allowed emissions levels for all new cars sold in California and mandatory regular emission tests of older vehicles, resulted in significant improvements in air quality. For example, air concentrations of volatile organic compounds declined by a factor of 50 between 1962 and 2012. Concentrations of air pollutants such as nitrous oxides and ozone declined by 70% to 80% over the same period of time.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, massive immigration to <a href="/wiki/Ulaanbaatar" title="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a> from the countryside began. An estimated 150,000 households, mainly living in traditional Mongolian <a href="/wiki/Yurt" title="Yurt">gers</a> on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, burn wood and coal (some poor families burn even car tires and trash) to heat themselves during the harsh winter, which lasts from October to April, since these outskirts are not connected to the city's central heating system. A temporary solution to decrease smog was proposed in the form of stoves with improved efficiency, although with no visible results. Coal-fired ger stoves release high levels of ash and other particulate matter (PM). When inhaled, these particles can settle in the lungs and respiratory tract and cause health problems. At two to 10 times above Mongolian and international air quality standards, Ulaanbaatar's PM rates are among the worst in the world, according to a December 2009 World Bank report. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that health costs related to this air pollution account for as much as 4 percent of Mongolia's GDP.</p>

A similar haze has occurred in June 2013, with the PSI setting a <a href="/wiki/Pollutant_Standards_Index#PSI_in_Singapore" title="Pollutant Standards Index">new record</a> in Singapore on June 21 at 12pm with a reading of 401, which is in the "Hazardous" range.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations" title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN) reacted. In 2002, the <a href="/wiki/ASEAN_Agreement_on_Transboundary_Haze_Pollution" title="ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution">Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution</a> was signed between all ASEAN nations. ASEAN formed a Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) and established a co-ordination and support unit (CSU). RHAP, with the help of <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, established a monitoring and warning system for forest/vegetation fires and implemented a Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). The Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) has issued a daily rating of fire danger since September 2003. Indonesia has been ineffective at enforcing legal policies on errant farmers.</p>

<p>Since start of winter season heavy smog loaded with pollutants covered major part of Punjab especially the city of Lahore, causing breathing problems and disrupting normal traffic.</p>
<p>Doctors advised residents to stay indoors and wear facemasks outside.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pollution_index">Pollution index</span></h2>

<p>The severity of smog is often measured using automated optical instruments such as <a href="/wiki/Nephelometer" title="Nephelometer">Nephelometers</a>, as haze is associated with visibility and traffic control in ports. Haze however can also be an indication of poor air quality though this is often better reflected using accurate purpose built air indexes such as the American <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_Quality_Index" title="Air Quality Index">Air Quality Index</a>, the Malaysian API (Air Pollution Index) and the Singaporean <a href="/wiki/Pollutant_Standards_Index" title="Pollutant Standards Index">Pollutant Standards Index</a>.</p>
<p>In hazy conditions, it is likely that the index will report the suspended particulate level. The disclosure of the responsible pollutant is mandated in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Malaysian API does not have a capped value; hence its most hazardous readings can go above 500. Above 500, a state of emergency is declared in the affected area. Usually, this means that non-essential government services are suspended, and all ports in the affected area are closed. There may also be prohibitions on private sector commercial and industrial activities in the affected area excluding the food sector. So far, state of emergency rulings due to hazardous API levels were applied to the Malaysian towns of Port Klang, Kuala Selangor and the state of Sarawak during the <a href="/wiki/2005_Malaysian_haze" title="2005 Malaysian haze">2005 Malaysian haze</a> and the <a href="/wiki/1997_Southeast_Asian_haze" title="1997 Southeast Asian haze">1997 Southeast Asian haze</a>.</p>
