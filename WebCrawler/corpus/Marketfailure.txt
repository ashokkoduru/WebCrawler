<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p>In economics, <b>market failure</b> is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services is not <a href="/wiki/Economic_efficiency" title="Economic efficiency">efficient</a>. That is, there exists another conceivable outcome where an individual may be made better-off <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">without making someone else worse-off</a>. Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian philosopher <a href="/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick" title="Henry Sidgwick">Henry Sidgwick</a>.</p>
<p><b>Market failures</b> are often associated with <a href="/wiki/Time-inconsistent_preferences" title="Time-inconsistent preferences">time-inconsistent preferences</a>, <a href="/wiki/Information_asymmetry" title="Information asymmetry">information asymmetries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Market_structure" title="Market structure">non-competitive markets</a>, <a href="/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem" title="Principal–agent problem">principal–agent problems</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Externalities" title="Externalities">externalities</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_goods" title="Public goods">public goods</a>. The existence of a market failure is often the reason that self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions intervene in a particular <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">market</a>. Economists, especially <a href="/wiki/Microeconomics" title="Microeconomics">microeconomists</a>, are often concerned with the causes of market failure and possible means of correction. Such analysis plays an important role in many types of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_policy_(law)" title="Public policy (law)">public policy</a> decisions and studies. However, government policy interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, <a href="/wiki/Bailout" title="Bailout">bailouts</a>, wage and price controls, and <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulations</a> (including poorly implemented attempts to correct market failure), may also lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called <a href="/wiki/Government_failure" title="Government failure">government failure</a>.</p>
<p>Given the tension between, on the one hand, the undeniable costs to society caused by <b>market failure</b>, and on the other hand, the potential that attempts to mitigate these costs could lead to even greater costs from "government failure," there is sometimes a choice between imperfect outcomes, i.e. imperfect market outcomes with or without government interventions. But either way, if a market failure exists the outcome is not <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">Pareto efficient</a>. Most mainstream economists believe that there are circumstances (like building codes or endangered species) in which it is possible for government or other organizations to improve the inefficient market outcome. Several <a href="/wiki/Heterodox_economics" title="Heterodox economics">heterodox</a> schools of thought disagree with this as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>An <i>ecological</i> <b>market failure</b> exists when human activity in a market economy is exhausting critical non-renewable resources, disrupting fragile ecosystems services, or overloading biospheric waste absorption capacities. In none of these cases does the criterion of Pareto efficiency obtain.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Categories">Categories</span></h2>
<p>Different economists have different views about what events are the sources of market failure. Mainstream economic analysis widely accepts a market failure (relative to <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a>) can occur for three main reasons: if the market is "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monopolised" title="Monopolised">monopolised</a>" or a small group of businesses hold significant <a href="/wiki/Market_power" title="Market power">market power</a>, if production of the good or service results in an <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externality</a>, or if the good or service is a "<a href="/wiki/Public_good" title="Public good">public good</a>".</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Agent_(economics)" title="Agent (economics)">Agents</a> in a market can gain <a href="/wiki/Market_power" title="Market power">market power</a>, allowing them to block other mutually beneficial <a href="/wiki/Gains_from_trade" title="Gains from trade">gains from trade</a> from occurring. This can lead to inefficiency due to <a href="/wiki/Imperfect_competition" title="Imperfect competition">imperfect competition</a>, which can take many different forms, such as <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopolies</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monopsonies" title="Monopsonies">monopsonies</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Monopolistic_competition" title="Monopolistic competition">monopolistic competition</a>, if the agent does not implement perfect price discrimination. In a monopoly, the market equilibrium will no longer be Pareto optimal. The monopoly will use its market power to restrict output below the quantity at which the marginal social benefit is equal to the <a href="/wiki/Social_cost" title="Social cost">marginal social cost</a> of the last unit produced, so as to keep prices and profits high. An issue for this analysis is whether a situation of market power or monopoly is likely to persist if unaddressed by policy, or whether competitive or technological change will undermine it over time.</p>
<p>It is then a further question about what circumstances allow a monopoly to arise. In some cases, monopolies can maintain themselves where there are "<a href="/wiki/Barriers_to_entry" title="Barriers to entry">barriers to entry</a>" that prevent other companies from effectively entering and competing in an industry or market. Or there could exist significant <a href="/wiki/First-mover_advantage" title="First-mover advantage">First-mover advantages</a> in the market that make it difficult for other firms to compete. In another way, a <a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly" title="Natural monopoly">Natural monopoly</a> is an extreme case of the failure of competition as a restraint on producers. A natural monopoly is a firm whose per-unit cost decreases as it increases output; in this situation it is most efficient (from a cost perspective) to have only a single producer of a good.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_nature_of_the_goods">The nature of the goods</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-excludability">Non-excludability</span></h4>
<p>Some markets can fail due to the nature of the goods being exchanged. For instance, goods can display the attributes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_goods" title="Public goods">public goods</a> or <a href="/wiki/Common_good" title="Common good">common goods</a>, wherein sellers are unable to <a href="/wiki/Excludability" title="Excludability">exclude</a> non-buyers from using a product, as in the development of inventions that may spread freely once revealed. This can cause underinvestment because developers cannot capture enough of the benefits from success to make the development effort worthwhile. This can also lead to resource depletion in the case of <a href="/wiki/Common-pool_resource" title="Common-pool resource">common-pool resources</a>, where, because use of the resource is <a href="/wiki/Competition" title="Competition">rival</a> but <a href="/wiki/Excludability" title="Excludability">non-excludable</a>, there is no incentive for users to conserve the resource. An example of this is a lake with a natural supply of fish: if people catch the fish faster than they can reproduce, then the fish population will dwindle until there are no fish left for future generations.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Externalities">Externalities</span></h4>
<p>A good or service could also have significant <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externalities</a>, where gains or losses associated with the product, production or consumption of a product because it differs from the private <a href="/wiki/Cost" title="Cost">cost</a>. These externalities can be innate to the methods of production or other conditions important to the market. For example, when a firm is producing steel, it absorbs labor, capital and other inputs, it must pay for these in the appropriate markets, and these costs will be reflected in the market price for steel. If the firm also pollutes the atmosphere when it makes steel, however, and if it is not forced to pay for the use of this resource, then this cost will be borne not by the firm but by society. Hence, the market price for steel will fail to incorporate the full opportunity cost to society of producing. In this case, the market equilibrium in the steel industry will not be optimal. More steel will be produced than would occur were the firm to have to pay for all of its costs of production. Consequently, the marginal social cost of the last unit produced will exceed its marginal social benefit.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Traffic_congestion" title="Traffic congestion">Traffic congestion</a> is an example of market failure that incorporates both non-excludability and externality. Public roads are common resources that are available for the entire population's use (non-excludable), and act as a <a href="/wiki/Complementary_good" title="Complementary good">complement</a> to cars (the more roads there are, the more useful cars become). Because there is very low cost but high benefit to individual drivers in using the roads, the roads become congested, decreasing their usefulness to society. Furthermore, driving can impose <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hidden_costs" title="Hidden costs">hidden costs</a> on society through pollution (externality). Solutions for this include <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public transportation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Congestion_pricing" title="Congestion pricing">congestion pricing</a>, tolls, and other ways of making the driver include the social cost in the decision to drive.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best example of the inefficiency associated with common/public goods and externalities is the environmental harm caused by <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Overexploitation" title="Overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">natural resources</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_nature_of_the_exchange">The nature of the exchange</span></h3>
<p>Some markets can fail due to the nature of their exchange. Markets may have significant <a href="/wiki/Transaction_cost" title="Transaction cost">transaction costs</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Principal-agent_problem" title="Principal-agent problem">agency problems</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Information_asymmetry" title="Information asymmetry">informational asymmetry</a>. Such <a href="/wiki/Incomplete_markets" title="Incomplete markets">incomplete markets</a> may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies. From <a href="/wiki/Contract_theory" title="Contract theory">contract theory</a>, decisions in transactions where one party has more or better <a href="/wiki/Information" title="Information">information</a> than the other is an asymmetry. This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry. Examples of this problem are <a href="/wiki/Adverse_selection" title="Adverse selection">adverse selection</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moral_hazard" title="Moral hazard">moral hazard</a>. Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of <a href="/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem" title="Principal–agent problem">principal–agent problems</a>. <a href="/wiki/George_Akerlof" title="George Akerlof">George Akerlof</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Spence" title="Michael Spence">Michael Spence</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_E._Stiglitz" title="Joseph E.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bounded_rationality">Bounded rationality</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Bounded_rationality" title="Bounded rationality">Bounded rationality</a></div>
<p>In <i>Models of Man</i>, <a href="/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" title="Herbert A. Simon">Herbert A. Simon</a> points out that most people are only partly rational, and are emotional/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irrational" title="Irrational">irrational</a> in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states "boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) <a href="/wiki/Information" title="Information">information</a>" (<a href="/wiki/Oliver_E._Williamson" title="Oliver E. Williamson">Williamson</a>, p. 553, citing Simon). Simon describes a number of dimensions along which "classical" models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while sticking within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>limiting what sorts of <a href="/wiki/Utility" title="Utility">utility</a> functions there might be.</li>
<li>recognizing the costs of gathering and processing information.</li>
<li>the possibility of having a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vector_(geometry)" title="Vector (geometry)">vector</a>" or "multi-valued" utility function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simon suggests that economic agents employ the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heuristics" title="Heuristics">heuristics</a> to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation, and their inability to process and compute the expected utility of every alternative action. Deliberation costs might be high and there are often other, concurrent economic activities also requiring decisions.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Coase_theorem">Coase theorem</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Coase_theorem" title="Coase theorem">Coase theorem</a>, developed by <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Coase" title="Ronald Coase">Ronald Coase</a> and labeled as such by George Stigler, states that private transactions are efficient as long as property rights exist, only a small number of parties are involved, and transactions costs are low. Additionally, this efficiency will take place regardless of who owns the property rights. This theory comes from a section of Coase's Nobel prize-winning work <i><a href="/wiki/The_Problem_of_Social_Cost" title="The Problem of Social Cost">The Problem of Social Cost</a></i>. While the assumptions of low transactions costs and a small number of parties involved may not always be applicable in real-world markets, Coase's work changed the long-held belief that the owner of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Property_rights" title="Property rights">property rights</a> was a major determining factor in whether or not a market would fail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A market is an institution in which individuals or firms exchange not just commodities, but the <i>rights</i> to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. [...] Markets are institutions which organize the <i>exchange of control</i> of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, agents' control over the uses of their <a href="/wiki/Commodity" title="Commodity">commodities</a> can be imperfect, because the system of rights which defines that control is incomplete. Typically, this falls into two generalized rights – <i>excludability</i> and <i>transferability</i>. Excludability deals with the ability of agents to control who uses their commodity, and for how long – and the related costs associated with doing so. Transferability reflects the right of agents to transfer the rights of use from one agent to another, for instance by selling or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leasing" title="Leasing">leasing</a> a commodity, and the costs associated with doing so. If a given system of rights does not fully guarantee these at minimal (or no) cost, then the resulting distribution can be inefficient. Considerations such as these form an important part of the work of <a href="/wiki/Institutional_economics" title="Institutional economics">institutional economics</a>. Nonetheless, views still differ on whether something displaying these attributes is meaningful without the information provided by the market price system.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Interpretations_and_policy_examples">Interpretations and policy examples</span></h2>
<p>The above causes represent the <a href="/wiki/Mainstream_economics" title="Mainstream economics">mainstream</a> view of what market failures mean and of their importance in the economy. This analysis follows the lead of the <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_economics" title="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical</a> school, and relies on the notion of <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a> – and specifically considers market failures absent considerations of the "<a href="/wiki/Public_interest" title="Public interest">public interest</a>", or <a href="/wiki/Equity_(economics)" title="Equity (economics)">equity</a>, citing definitional concerns. This form of analysis has also been adopted by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keynesian" title="Keynesian">Keynesian</a> or <a href="/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics" title="New Keynesian economics">new Keynesian</a> schools in modern <a href="/wiki/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">macroeconomics</a>, applying it to <a href="/wiki/Walras" title="Walras">Walrasian</a> models of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_equilibrium" title="General equilibrium">general equilibrium</a> in order to deal with failures to attain <a href="/wiki/Full_employment" title="Full employment">full employment</a>, or the non-adjustment of prices and wages.</p>
<p>Policies to prevent market failure are already commonly implemented in the economy. For example, to prevent information asymmetry, members of the New York Stock Exchange agree to abide by its rules in order to promote a fair and orderly market in the trading of listed securities. The members of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NYSE" title="NYSE">NYSE</a> presumably believe that each member is individually better off if every member adheres to its rules - even if they have to forego money-making opportunities that would violate those rules.</p>
<p>As an example of externalities, municipal governments enforce building codes and license tradesmen to mitigate the incentive to use cheaper (but more dangerous) construction practices, ensuring that the total cost of new construction includes the (otherwise external) cost of preventing future tragedies. The voters who elect municipal officials presumably feel that they are individually better off if everyone complies with the local codes, even if those codes may increase the cost of construction in their communities.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/CITES" title="CITES">CITES</a> is an international treaty to protect the world's common interest in preserving endangered species—a classic "public good"—against the private interests of poachers, developers and other market participants who might otherwise reap monetary benefits without bearing the known and unknown costs that extinction could create. Even without knowing the true cost of extinction, the signatory countries believe that the societal costs far outweigh the possible private gains that they have agreed to forego.</p>
<p>Some remedies for market failure can resemble other market failures. For example, the issue of systematic underinvestment in research is addressed by the <a href="/wiki/Patent" title="Patent">patent</a> system that creates artificial monopolies for successful inventions.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_choice">Public choice</span></h3>
<p>Economists such as <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicago_School_of_Economics" title="Chicago School of Economics">Chicago school</a> and others from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_choice_theory" title="Public choice theory">Public Choice</a> school, argue that market failure does not necessarily imply that government should attempt to solve market failures, because the costs of <a href="/wiki/Government_failure" title="Government failure">government failure</a> might be worse than those of the market failure it attempts to fix. This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups (<a href="/wiki/Rent-seeking" title="Rent-seeking">rent seekers</a>) both in the <a href="/wiki/Private_sector" title="Private sector">private sector</a> and in the government <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>. Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by <a href="/wiki/Coercion" title="Coercion">coercive</a> government intervention. Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Austrian">Austrian</span></h3>
<p>Some advocates of <i><a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, including many economists of the <a href="/wiki/Austrian_School" title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a>, argue that there is no such phenomenon as "market failure". <a href="/wiki/Israel_Kirzner" title="Israel Kirzner">Israel Kirzner</a> states that, "Efficiency for a social system means the efficiency with which it permits its individual members to achieve their individual goals." Inefficiency only arises when means are chosen by individuals that are inconsistent with their desired goals. This definition of efficiency differs from that of <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a>, and forms the basis of the theoretical argument against the existence of market failures. However, providing that the conditions of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_welfare_theorem" title="First welfare theorem">first welfare theorem</a> are met, these two definitions agree, and give identical results. Austrians argue that the market tends to eliminate its inefficiencies through the process of <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneurship" title="Entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a> driven by the <a href="/wiki/Profit_motive" title="Profit motive">profit motive</a>; something the government has great difficulty detecting, or correcting.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marxian">Marxian</span></h3>
<p>Objections also exist on more fundamental bases, such as that of <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">equity</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian analysis</a>. Colloquial uses of the term "market failure" reflect the notion of a market "failing" to provide some desired attribute different from efficiency – for instance, high levels of inequality can be considered a "market failure", yet are not <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">Pareto inefficient</a>, and so would not be considered a market failure by mainstream economics. In addition, many <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian</a> economists would argue that the system of individual property rights is a fundamental problem in itself, and that resources should be allocated in another way entirely. This is different from concepts of "market failure" which focuses on specific situations – typically seen as "abnormal" – where markets have inefficient outcomes. Marxists, in contrast, would say that markets have inefficient and democratically unwanted outcomes – viewing market failure as an inherent feature of any capitalist economy – and typically omit it from discussion, preferring to ration finite goods not exclusively through a price mechanism, but based upon need as determined by society expressed through the community.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecological">Ecological</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics#Not_.27externalities.27.2C_but_cost_shifting" title="Ecological economics">Ecological economics § Not 'externalities', but cost shifting</a>; <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising_neoclassical_economics_.28weak_versus_strong_sustainability.29" title="Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen">Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen § Criticising neoclassical economics (weak versus strong sustainability)</a>; <a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">Tragedy of the commons</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Uneconomic_growth" title="Uneconomic growth">Uneconomic growth</a></div>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">ecological economics</a>, the concept of <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externalities</a> is considered a misnomer, since market agents are viewed as making their incomes and profits by <a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics#Not_.27externalities.27.2C_but_cost_shifting" title="Ecological economics">systematically 'shifting' the social and ecological costs</a> of their activities onto other agents, including future generations. Hence, externalities is a <i>modus operandi</i> of the market, not a failure: The market cannot exist without constantly 'failing'.</p>
<p>The fair and even allocation of non-renewable resources over time is a market failure issue of concern to ecological economics. This issue is also known as 'intergenerational fairness'. It is argued that the <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)#Mechanisms_of_markets" title="Market (economics)">market mechanism</a> fails when it comes to allocating the Earth's finite mineral stock fairly and evenly among present and future generations, as future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market.  In effect, today's market prices do not, and cannot, reflect the preferences of the yet unborn. This is an instance of a market failure passed unrecognized by most mainstream economists, as the concept of <a href="/wiki/Pareto_efficiency" title="Pareto efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a> is entirely static (timeless). Imposing government restrictions on the general level of activity in the economy may be the only way of bringing about a more fair and even intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock. Hence, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen" title="Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen">Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Herman_Daly" title="Herman Daly">Herman Daly</a>, the two leading theorists in the field, have both called for the imposition of such restrictions: Georgescu-Roegen has proposed a minimal bioeconomic program, and Daly has proposed a <a href="/wiki/Steady-state_economy#Herman_Daly.27s_concept_of_a_steady-state_economy" title="Steady-state economy">comprehensive steady-state economy</a>.  However, Georgescu-Roegen, Daly, and other economists in the field agree that on a finite Earth, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising_Daly.27s_steady-state_economics" title="Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen">geologic limits will inevitably strain most fairness in the longer run</a>, regardless of any present government restrictions: <i>Any</i> rate of extraction and use of the finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources will diminish the remaining stock left over for future generations to use.    </p>
<p>Another ecological market failure is presented by the overutilisation of an otherwise renewable resource at a point in time, or within a short period of time. Such overutilisation usually occurs when the resource in question has poorly defined (or non-existing) <a href="/wiki/Property_rights_(economics)" title="Property rights (economics)">property rights</a> attached to it while too many market agents engage in activity simultaneously for the resource to be able to sustain it all. Examples range from over-fishing of fisheries and over-grazing of pastures to over-crowding of recreational areas in congested cities. This type of ecological market failure is generally known as the '<a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>'. In this type of market failure, the principle of Pareto efficiency is violated the utmost, as <i>all</i> agents in the market are left worse off, while nobody are benefitting. It has been argued that the best way to remedy a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure is to establish enforceable property rights politically — only, this may be easier said than done.</p>
<p>The issue of <a href="/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change" title="Attribution of recent climate change">anthropogenic global warming</a> — that is, <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_denial" title="Climate change denial">if the warming really <i>is</i> anthropogenic</a> — presents an overwhelming example of a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure: The Earth's <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="Atmosphere of Earth">atmosphere</a> may be regarded as a 'global common' exhibiting poorly defined (non-existing) property rights, and the waste absorption capacity of the atmosphere with regard to carbon dioxide is presently being heavily overloaded by a too large volume of emissions from the <a href="/wiki/World_economy" title="World economy">world economy</a>. Historically, the <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> dependence of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> has unintentionally thrown mankind out of ecological equilibrium with the rest of the Earth's biosphere (including the atmosphere), and the market has failed to correct the situation ever since. Quite the opposite: The unrestricted market has been exacerbating this global state of ecological <i>dis</i>-equilibrium, and is expected to continue doing so well into the foreseeable future. This particular market failure may be remedied to some extent at the political level by the establishment of an international (or regional) <a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">cap and trade property rights system</a>, where carbon dioxide emission permits are bought and sold among market agents.</p>
<p>The term '<a href="/wiki/Uneconomic_growth" title="Uneconomic growth">uneconomic growth</a>' describes a pervasive ecological market failure: The ecological costs of further economic growth in a so-called 'full-world economy' like the present world economy may exceed the immediate social benefits derived from this growth.</p>
