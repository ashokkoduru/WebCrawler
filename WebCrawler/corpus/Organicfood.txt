<p><b>Organic food</b> is <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a> produced by methods that comply with the standards of <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a>. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a> in farming. In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using <a href="/wiki/Irradiation" title="Irradiation">irradiation</a>, industrial solvents or synthetic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_additives" title="Food additives">food additives</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain <a href="/wiki/Organic_certification" title="Organic certification">special certification</a> in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regulations" title="Regulations">regulations</a>, organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations, national governments and international organizations. Although the produce of <a href="/wiki/Kitchen_garden" title="Kitchen garden">kitchen gardens</a> may be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the <a href="/wiki/National_Organic_Program" title="National Organic Program">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) or <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> (EC).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">For more details on the production of organic food, see <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">Organic farming</a>.</div>
<p>For the vast majority of its history, agriculture can be described as having been organic; only during the 20th century was a large supply of new products, generally deemed not organic, introduced into food production. The organic farming movement arose in the 1940s in response to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a> of <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>In 1939, <a href="/wiki/Walter_James,_4th_Baron_Northbourne" title="Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne">Lord Northbourne</a> coined the term <i>organic farming</i> in his book <i>Look to the Land</i> (1940), out of his conception of "the farm as organism," to describe a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming—in contrast to what he called <i>chemical farming</i>, which relied on "imported fertility" and "cannot be self-sufficient nor an organic whole." Early soil scientists also described the differences in soil composition when animal manures were used as "organic", because they contain carbon compounds where superphosphates and haber process nitrogen do not. Their respective use affects <a href="/wiki/Humus" title="Humus">humus</a> content of soil. This is different from the scientific use of the term "organic" in chemistry, which refers to <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">a class of molecules that contain carbon</a>, especially those involved in the chemistry of life. This class of molecules includes everything likely to be considered edible, and include most pesticides and toxins too, therefore the term "organic" and, especially, the term "inorganic" (sometimes wrongly used as a contrast by the popular press) as they apply to organic chemistry is an equivocation fallacy when applied to farming, the production of food, and to foodstuffs themselves. Properly used in this agricultural science context, "organic" refers to the methods grown and processed, not necessarily the chemical composition of the food.</p>
<p>Ideas that organic food could be healthier and better for the environment originated in the early days of the <a href="/wiki/Organic_movement" title="Organic movement">organic movement</a> as a result of publications like the 1943 book <a href="/wiki/The_Living_Soil" title="The Living Soil">The Living Soil</a> and <i>Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease</i> (1945).</p>
<p>Early consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, non-use of unapproved pesticides, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers. Later, "Know your farmer, know your food" became the motto of a new initiative instituted by the USDA in September 2009. Personal definitions of what constituted "organic" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities. Small farms grew vegetables (and raised livestock) using <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a> practices, with or without certification, and the individual consumer monitored. Small specialty health food stores and co-operatives were instrumental to bringing organic food to a wider audience. As demand for organic foods continued to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets such as supermarkets rapidly replaced the direct farmer connection. Today, many large corporate farms have an organic division. However, for supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable, and product labeling, like "certified organic", is relied upon. Government regulations and third-party inspectors are looked to for assurance.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, interest in organic food grew with the publication of <a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a> and the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a>, and was also spurred by food-related health scares like the concerns about <a href="/wiki/Daminozide" title="Daminozide">Alar</a> that arose in the mid-1980s.</p>

<p>Organic food production is a self-regulated industry with government oversight in some countries, distinct from <a href="/wiki/Kitchen_garden" title="Kitchen garden">private gardening</a>. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain <a href="/wiki/Organic_certification" title="Organic certification">special certification</a> based on government-defined standards in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, foods marketed as organic are produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by national governments and international organic industry trade organizations.</p>
<p>In the United States, organic production is managed in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/Organic_Foods_Production_Act_of_1990" title="Organic Foods Production Act of 1990">Organic Foods Production Act of 1990</a> (OFPA) and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. If livestock are involved, the livestock must be reared with regular access to pasture and without the routine use of antibiotics or <a href="/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin" title="Bovine somatotropin">growth hormones</a>.</p>
<p>Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non-organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States, Canada, and Australia). Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_additives" title="Food additives">food additives</a>, and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions, such as <a href="/wiki/SmartFresh" title="SmartFresh">chemical ripening</a>, <a href="/wiki/Food_irradiation" title="Food irradiation">food irradiation</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetically_modified" title="Genetically modified">genetically modified</a> ingredients. Pesticides are allowed as long as they are not synthetic. However, under US federal organic standards, if pests and weeds are not controllable through management practices, nor via organic pesticides and herbicides, "a substance included on the National List of synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production may be applied to prevent, suppress, or control pests, weeds, or diseases." Several groups have called for organic standards to prohibit <a href="/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> on the basis of the <a href="/wiki/Precautionary_principle" title="Precautionary principle">precautionary principle</a> in light of unknown risks of nanotechnology. The use of nanotechnology-based products in the production of organic food is prohibited in some jurisdictions (Canada, the UK, and Australia) and is unregulated in others.</p>

<p>In the United States, there are four different levels or categories for organic labeling. 1)‘100%’ Organic: This means that all ingredients are produced organically. It also may have the USDA seal. 2)‘Organic’: At least 95% or more of the ingredients are organic. 3)’Made With Organic Ingredients': Contains at least 70% organic ingredients. 4)‘Less Than 70% Organic Ingredients’: Three of the organic ingredients must be listed under the ingredient section of the label. In the U.S., the food label "natural" or "all natural" does not mean that the food was produced and processed organically.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_perception">Public perception</span></h2>
<p>There is widespread public belief that organic food is safer, more nutritious, and better tasting than conventional food. Consumers purchase organic foods for different reasons, including concerns about the effects of conventional farming practices on the environment, human health, and animal welfare.</p>
<p>The most important reason for purchasing organic foods seems to be beliefs about the products' health-giving properties and higher nutritional value. These beliefs are promoted by the organic food industry, and have fueled increased demand for organic food despite higher prices and difficulty in confirming these claimed benefits scientifically. Organic labels also stimulate the consumer to view the product as having more positive nutritional value.</p>
<p>Psychological effects such as the <a href="/wiki/Halo_effect" title="Halo effect">“halo” effect</a>, which are related to the choice and consumption of organic food, are also important motivating factors in the purchase of organic food. The perception that organic food is low-calorie food or health food appears to be common.</p>
<p>In China the increasing demand for organic products of all kinds, and in particular milk, baby food and infant formula, has been "spurred by a series of food scares, the worst being the death of six children who had consumed baby formula laced with melamine" in 2009 and the <a href="/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal" title="2008 Chinese milk scandal">2008 Chinese milk scandal</a>, making the Chinese market for organic milk the largest in the world as of 2014. A Pew Research Centre survey in 2012 indicated that 41% of Chinese consumers thought of food safety as a very big problem, up by three times from 12% in 2008.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taste">Taste</span></h3>
<p>There is no good evidence that organic food tastes better than its non-organic counterparts. There is evidence that some organic fruit is drier than conventionally grown fruit; a slightly drier fruit may also have a more intense flavor due to the higher concentration of flavoring substances.</p>
<p>Some foods, such as bananas, are picked when unripe, are cooled to prevent ripening while they are shipped to market, and then are induced to ripen quickly by exposing them to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propylene" title="Propylene">propylene</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ethylene" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a>, chemicals produced by plants to induce their own ripening; as flavor and texture changes during ripening, this process may affect those qualities of the treated fruit. The issue of ethylene use to ripen fruit in organic food production is contentious because ripeness when picked often does affect taste; opponents claim that its use benefits only large companies and that it opens the door to weaker organic standards.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_composition">Chemical composition</span></h2>

<p>With respect to chemical differences in the composition of organically grown food compared with conventionally grown food, studies have examined differences in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nutrients" title="Nutrients">nutrients</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antinutrients" title="Antinutrients">antinutrients</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticide</a> residues. These studies generally suffer from <a href="/wiki/Confounding" title="Confounding">confounding</a> variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, the methods of testing, and because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of food; these variables include variations in weather (season to season as well as place to place); crop treatments (fertilizer, pesticide, etc.); soil composition; the cultivar used, and in the case of meat and dairy products, the parallel variables in animal production. Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between harvest and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given item of food. Additionally, there is evidence that organic produce is drier than conventionally grown produce; a higher content in any chemical category may be explained by higher concentration rather than in absolute amounts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutrients">Nutrients</span></h3>
<p>Many people believe that organic foods have higher content of nutrients and thus are healthier than conventionally produced foods. However, scientists have not been equally convinced that this is the case as the research conducted in the field has not shown consistent results.</p>
<p>A 2009 systematic review in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that organically produced foodstuffs are not richer in vitamins and minerals than conventionally produced foodstuffs. The results of the systematic review only showed a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus content in organic produced compared to conventionally grown foodstuffs. Content of vitamin C, calcium, potassium, total soluble solids, copper, iron, nitrates, manganese, and sodium did not differ between the two categories.</p>
<p>A 2014 meta-analysis of 343 studies found that organically grown crops had 17% higher concentrations of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyphenols" title="Polyphenols">polyphenols</a> than conventionally grown crops. Concentrations of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phenolic_acids" title="Phenolic acids">phenolic acids</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flavanones" title="Flavanones">flavanones</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stilbenes" title="Stilbenes">stilbenes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flavones" title="Flavones">flavones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flavonols" title="Flavonols">flavonols</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthocyanins" title="Anthocyanins">anthocyanins</a> were elevated, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flavanones" title="Flavanones">flavanones</a> being 69% higher.</p>
<p>A 2012 survey of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study. Produce studies reported on <a href="/wiki/Ascorbic_acid" title="Ascorbic acid">ascorbic acid</a> (<a href="/wiki/Vitamin_C" title="Vitamin C">Vitamin C</a>) (31 studies), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beta-carotene" title="Beta-carotene">beta-carotene</a> (a precursor for <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_A" title="Vitamin A">Vitamin A</a>) (12 studies), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alpha-tocopherol" title="Alpha-tocopherol">alpha-tocopherol</a> (a form of <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_E" title="Vitamin E">Vitamin E</a>) (5 studies) content; milk studies reported on beta-carotene (4 studies) and alpha-tocopherol levels (4 studies). Few studies examined vitamin content in meats, but these found no difference in beta-carotene in beef, alpha-tocopherol in pork or beef, or vitamin A (retinol) in beef. The authors analyzed 11 other nutrients reported in studies of produce. Only two nutrients were significantly higher in organic than conventional produce: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phosphorus_in_biological_systems" title="Phosphorus in biological systems">phosphorus</a> and total <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyphenols" title="Polyphenols">polyphenols</a>). A 2011 literature review found that organic foods had a higher micronutrient content overall than conventionally produced foods.</p>
<p>Similarly, organic chicken contained higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than conventional chicken. The authors found no difference in the protein or fat content of organic and conventional raw milk.</p>
<p>A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that organic meat had comparable or slightly lower levels of <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Monounsaturated_fat" title="Monounsaturated fat">monounsaturated fat</a> as conventional meat, but higher levels of both overall and n-3 <a href="/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid" title="Polyunsaturated fatty acid">polyunsaturated fatty acids</a>. Another meta-analysis published the same year found no significant differences in levels of saturated and monounsaturated fat between organic and conventional milk, but significantly higher levels of overall and n-3 <a href="/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid" title="Polyunsaturated fatty acid">polyunsaturated fatty acids</a> in organic milk than in conventional milk.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Anti-nutrients">Anti-nutrients</span></h3>
<p>The amount of <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> content in certain vegetables, especially green <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leafy_vegetables" title="Leafy vegetables">leafy vegetables</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tuber" title="Tuber">tubers</a>, has been found to be lower when grown organically as compared to conventionally. When evaluating environmental toxins such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)" title="Heavy metal (chemistry)">heavy metals</a>, the USDA has noted that organically raised <a href="/wiki/Chicken" title="Chicken">chicken</a> may have lower <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> levels. Early literature reviews found no significant evidence that levels of arsenic, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> or other heavy metals differed significantly between organic and conventional food products. However, a 2014 review found lower concentrations of cadmium, particularly in organically grown grains.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pesticide_residues">Pesticide residues</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_residue" title="Pesticide residue">Pesticide residue</a></div>
<p>The amount of pesticides that remain in or on food is called pesticides residue. In the United States, before a pesticide can be used on a food crop, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must determine whether that pesticide can be used without posing a risk to human health.</p>
<p>A 2012 meta-analysis determined that detectable pesticide residues were found in 7% of organic produce samples and 38% of conventional produce samples. This result was statistically heterogeneous, potentially because of the variable level of detection used among these studies. Only three studies reported the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits; all were from the European Union. A 2014 meta-analysis found that conventionally grown produce was four times more likely to have pesticide residue than organically grown crops.</p>
<p>The American Cancer Society has stated that no evidence exists that the small amount of pesticide residue found on conventional foods will increase the risk of cancer, though it recommends thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables. They have also stated that there is no research to show that organic food reduces cancer risk compared to foods grown with conventional farming methods.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> maintains strict guidelines on the regulation of pesticides by setting a tolerance on the amount of pesticide residue allowed to be in or on any particular food. Although some residue may remain at the time of harvest, residue tend to decline as the pesticide breaks down over time. In addition, as the commodities are washed and processed prior to sale, the residues often diminish further.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bacterial_contamination">Bacterial contamination</span></h3>
<p>A 2012 <a href="/wiki/Meta-analysis" title="Meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> determined that prevalence of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/E._coli" title="E. coli">E. coli</a></i> contamination was not <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statistically_significant" title="Statistically significant">statistically significant</a> (7% in organic produce and 6% in conventional produce). While bacterial contamination is common among both organic and conventional animal products, differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were also statistically insignificant.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organic_meat_production_requirements">Organic meat production requirements</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<p>Organic meat certification in the United States requires farm animals to be raised according to USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations require that livestock are fed certified organic food that contains no animal byproducts. Further, organic farm animals can receive no <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Growth_hormones" title="Growth hormones">growth hormones</a> or <a href="/wiki/Antibiotics" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a>, and they must be raised using techniques that protect native species and other natural resources. <a href="/wiki/Irradiation" title="Irradiation">Irradiation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a> are not allowed with organic animal production. One of the major differences in organic animal husbandry protocol is the "pasture rule": minimum requirements for time on pasture do vary somewhat by species and between the certifying agencies, but the common theme is to require as much time on pasture as possible and reasonable.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_and_safety">Health and safety</span></h2>
<p>There is little scientific evidence of benefit or harm to human health from a diet high in organic food, and conducting any sort of rigorous experiment on the subject is very difficult. A 2012 meta-analysis noted that "there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct." A 2009 meta-analysis noted that "most of the included articles did not study direct human health outcomes. In ten of the included studies (83%), a primary outcome was the change in antioxidant activity. Antioxidant status and activity are useful biomarkers but do not directly equate to a health outcome. Of the remaining two articles, one recorded proxy-reported measures of atopic manifestations as its primary health outcome, whereas the other article examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and implied possible health benefits for infants from the consumption of different amounts of conjugated linoleic acids from breast milk." In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional food make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis.</p>
<p>With regard to the possibility that some organic food may have higher levels of certain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-oxidants" title="Anti-oxidants">anti-oxidants</a>, evidence regarding whether increased anti-oxidant consumption improves health is conflicting.</p>
<p>As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while "consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food.... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view." A 12-month systematic review commissioned by the FSA in 2009 and conducted at the <a href="/wiki/London_School_of_Hygiene_%26_Tropical_Medicine" title="London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine">London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</a> based on 50 years' worth of collected evidence concluded that "there is no good evidence that consumption of organic food is beneficial to health in relation to nutrient content." There is no support in the scientific literature that the lower levels of nitrogen in certain organic vegetables translates to improved health risk.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumer_safety">Consumer safety</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pesticide_exposure">Pesticide exposure</span></h4>
<p>The main difference between organic and conventional food products are the chemicals involved during production and processing. The residues of those chemicals in food products have dubious effects on the human health. All food products on the market including those that contain residues of pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones and other types of chemicals that are used during production and processing are said to be safe.</p>
<p>Claims of improved safety of organic food has largely focused on <a href="/wiki/Pesticide_residue" title="Pesticide residue">pesticide residues</a>. These concerns are driven by the facts that "(1) acute, massive exposure to pesticides can cause significant adverse health effects; (2) food products have occasionally been contaminated with pesticides, which can result in acute toxicity; and (3) most, if not all, commercially purchased food contains trace amounts of agricultural pesticides." However, as is frequently noted in the scientific literature: "What does not follow from this, however, is that chronic exposure to the trace amounts of pesticides found in food results in demonstrable toxicity. This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantify;" therefore firm conclusions about the relative safety of organic foods have been hampered by the difficulty in proper <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Study_design" title="Study design">study design</a> and relatively small number of studies directly comparing organic food to conventional food.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Carcinogenic Potency Project, which is a part of the US <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EPA" title="EPA">EPA</a>'s Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network, has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results for the past ~30 years. Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, <i><a href="/wiki/Science_(journal)" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i>, in 1992:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural as well as synthetic chemicals.<br/></p>
<p>1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves) is ~1500 mg. In comparison, the total daily exposure to all synthetic pesticide residues combined is ~0.09 mg. Thus, we estimate that 99.99% of the pesticides humans ingest are natural. Despite this enormously greater exposure to natural chemicals, 79% (378 out of 479) of the chemicals tested for carcinogenicity in both rats and mice are synthetic (that is, do not occur naturally).<br/>
2) It has often been wrongly assumed that humans have evolved defenses against the natural chemicals in our diet but not against the synthetic chemicals. However, defenses that animals have evolved are mostly general rather than specific for particular chemicals; moreover, defenses are generally inducible and therefore protect well from low doses of both synthetic and natural chemicals.<br/></p>
3) Because the toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, one expects (and finds) a similar positivity rate for carcinogenicity among synthetic and natural chemicals. The positivity rate among chemicals tested in rats and mice is ~50%. Therefore, because humans are exposed to so many more natural than synthetic chemicals (by weight and by number), humans are exposed to an enormous background of rodent carcinogens, as defined by high-dose tests on rodents. We have shown that even though only a tiny proportion of natural pesticides in plant foods have been tested, the 29 that are rodent carcinogens among the 57 tested, occur in more than 50 common plant foods. It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens.</blockquote>
<p>While studies have shown via chemical analysis, as discussed above, that organically grown fruits and vegetables have significantly lower pesticide residue levels, the significance of this finding on actual health risk reduction is debatable as both conventional foods and organic foods generally have pesticide levels well below government established guidelines for what is considered safe. This view has been echoed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Agriculture" title="U.S. Department of Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> and the UK <a href="/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency" title="Food Standards Agency">Food Standards Agency</a>.</p>
<p>A study published by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council" title="United States National Research Council">National Research Council</a> in 1993 determined that for infants and children, the major source of exposure to pesticides is through diet. A study published in 2006 by Lu et al. measured the levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure in 23 school children before and after replacing their diet with organic food. In this study it was found that levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure dropped from negligible levels to undetectable levels when the children switched to an organic diet, the authors presented this reduction as a significant reduction in risk. The conclusions presented in Lu et al. were criticized in the literature as a case of bad scientific communication.</p>
<p>More specifically, claims related to pesticide residue of increased risk of <a href="/wiki/Infertility" title="Infertility">infertility</a> or lower <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Total_sperm_count" title="Total sperm count">sperm counts</a> have not been supported by the evidence in the medical literature. Likewise the <a href="/wiki/American_Cancer_Society" title="American Cancer Society">American Cancer Society</a> (ACS) has stated their official position that "whether organic foods carry a lower risk of cancer because they are less likely to be contaminated by compounds that might cause cancer is largely unknown." Reviews have noted that the risks from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbiological" title="Microbiological">microbiological</a> sources or natural <a href="/wiki/Toxin" title="Toxin">toxins</a> are likely to be much more significant than short term or chronic risks from pesticide residues.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Microbiological_contamination">Microbiological contamination</span></h4>
<p>In looking at possible increased risk to safety from organic food consumption, reviews have found that although there may be increased risk from microbiological contamination due to increased <a href="/wiki/Manure" title="Manure">manure</a> use as fertilizer from organisms like <a href="/wiki/Escherichia_coli_O157:H7" title="Escherichia coli O157:H7"><i>E. coli</i> O157:H7</a> during organic produce production, there is little evidence of actual incidence of outbreaks which can be positively blamed on organic food production. The <a href="/wiki/2011_Germany_E._coli_O104:H4_outbreak" title="2011 Germany E. coli O104:H4 outbreak">2011 Germany E. coli O104:H4 outbreak</a> was blamed on organic farming of bean sprouts.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h2>
<p>Demand for organic foods is primarily driven by concerns for personal health and for the environment. Global sales for organic foods climbed by more than 170 percent since 2002 reaching more than $63 billion in 2011 while certified organic farmland remained relatively small at less than 2 percent of total farmland under production, increasing in OECD and EU countries (which account for the majority of organic production) by 35 percent for the same time period. Organic products typically cost 10 to 40% more than similar conventionally produced products, to several times the price. Processed organic foods vary in price when compared to their conventional counterparts.</p>
<p>While organic food accounts for 1–2% of total food production worldwide, the organic food sales market is growing rapidly with between 5 and 10 percent of the food market share in the United States according to the Organic Trade Association, significantly outpacing sales growth volume in dollars of conventional food products. World organic food sales jumped from US $23 billion in 2002 to $63 billion in 2011.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Asia">Asia</span></h3>
<p>Production and consumption of organic products is rising rapidly in Asia, and both China and India are becoming global producers of organic crops and a number of countries, particularly China and Japan, also becoming large consumers of organic food and drink. The disparity between production and demand, is leading to a two-tier organic food industry, typified by significant and growing imports of primary organic products such as dairy and beef from Australia, Europe, New Zealand and the United States.</p>
