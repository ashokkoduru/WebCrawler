<p>In early human history, although the <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">resource</a> demands of nomadic hunter-gatherers was small, the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> emerged in various regions of the world. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agrarian_community" title="Agrarian community">Agrarian communities</a> depended largely on their <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">environment</a> and the creation of a "structure of permanence." Societies outgrowing their local food supply or depleting critical resources either moved on or faced collapse.</p>

<p>Archeological evidence suggests that the first civilizations arose in <a href="/wiki/Sumer" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, in southern <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (now Iraq) and <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, both dating from around 3000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BCE" title="BCE">BCE</a>. By 1000 BCE, civilizations were also established in India, China, Mexico, Peru and in parts of Europe. Sumer illustrates issues central to the sustainability of human civilization. Sumerian cities practised intensive, year-round <a href="/wiki/History_of_agriculture" title="History of agriculture">agriculture</a> from <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 5300</span> BCE. The surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating in search of wild foods and grazing land. It also allowed for a much greater population density. The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia required many labourers to build and maintain its <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> system. This, in turn, led to political <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religious</a> sanction, along with standing <a href="/wiki/Army" title="Army">armies</a> to protect the emergent civilization. Intensified agriculture allowed for population increase, but also led to <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> in upstream areas with resultant flooding and over-irrigation, which raised <a href="/wiki/Soil_salinity" title="Soil salinity">soil salinity</a>. While there was a shift from the cultivation of <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> to the more salt-tolerant <a href="/wiki/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>, yields still diminished. Eventually, decreasing agricultural production and other factors led to the decline of the civilization. From 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population was reduced by nearly sixty percent. Civilizations similarly thought to have eventually fallen because of poor management of resources include the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mayans" title="Mayans">Mayans</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anasazi" title="Anasazi">Anasazi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Easter_Island" title="Easter Island">Easter Islanders</a>, among many others. In contrast, stable communities of <a href="/wiki/Shifting_cultivation" title="Shifting cultivation">shifting cultivators</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Horticulturists" title="Horticulturists">horticulturists</a> existed in <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, and large agrarian communities in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> and elsewhere have farmed in the same localities for centuries. Some Polynesian cultures have maintained stable communities for between 1,000 and 3,000 years on small islands with minimal resources using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rahui" title="Rahui">rahui</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kaitiaki" title="Kaitiaki">kaitiakitanga</a> to control human pressure on the environment. In Sri Lanka nature reserves established during the reign of king <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Devanampiyatissa" title="Devanampiyatissa">Devanampiyatissa</a> and dating back to 307 BC were devoted to sustainability and harmonious living with nature.</p>

<p>Technological advances over several millennia gave humans increasing control over the environment. But it was the Western <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>. <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">Coal</a> was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. Such conditions led to a human population explosion and unprecedented industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the <a href="/wiki/Anthropocene" title="Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>. From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.</p>
<p>Concerns about the environmental and social impacts of industry were expressed by some <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> political economists and through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Romantic_movement" title="Romantic movement">Romantic movement</a> of the 1800s.

<p>By the 20th century, the industrial revolution had led to an exponential increase in the human consumption of resources. The increase in health, wealth and population was perceived as a simple path of progress. However, in the 1930s economists began developing models of <a href="/wiki/Non-renewable_resource" title="Non-renewable resource">non-renewable resource</a> management (see <a href="/wiki/Hotelling%27s_rule" title="Hotelling's rule">Hotelling's rule</a>) and the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable resources (<a href="/wiki/Hartwick%27s_rule" title="Hartwick's rule">Hartwick's rule</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">Ecology</a> had now gained general acceptance as a scientific discipline, and many concepts vital to sustainability were being explored. These included: the interconnectedness of all living systems in a single living planetary system, the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>; the importance of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycles" title="Biogeochemical cycles">natural cycles</a> (of water, nutrients and other chemicals, materials, waste); and the passage of energy through <a href="/wiki/Trophic_level" title="Trophic level">trophic levels</a> of living systems.</p>

<p>Following the deprivations of the great depression and World War II the <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed world</a> entered a new period of escalating growth, a post-1950s "great acceleration ... a surge in the human enterprise that has emphatically stamped humanity as a global geophysical force." A gathering <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a> pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. Innovations in technology (including plastics, synthetic chemicals, nuclear energy) and the increasing use of fossil fuels, were transforming society. Modern industrial agriculture—the "<a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>" — was based on the development of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides which had devastating consequences for rural wildlife, as documented by American marine biologist, naturalist and environmentalist <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a></i> (1962).</p>

King Hubbert's</a> <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a> theory predicted an inevitable peak of oil production, first in the United States (between 1965 and 1970), then in successive regions of the world - with a global peak expected thereafter. In the 1970s environmentalism's concern with pollution, the population explosion, consumerism and the depletion of finite resources found expression in <i><a href="/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful" title="Small Is Beautiful">Small Is Beautiful</a>,</i> by British economist <a href="/wiki/E._F._Schumacher" title="E.

<p>Environmental problems were now becoming global in scale. The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on a nonrenewable resource; President Carter in his State of the Union Address called on Americans to "Conserve energy. Eliminate waste. Make 1980 indeed a year of energy conservation." While the developed world was considering the problems of unchecked development the developing countries, faced with continued poverty and deprivation, regarded development as essential to raise the living standards of their peoples. In 1980 the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> had published its influential <i>World Conservation Strategy,</i> followed in 1982 by its <i><a href="/wiki/World_Charter_for_Nature" title="World Charter for Nature">World Charter for Nature</a>,</i> which drew attention to the decline of the world’s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystems" title="Ecosystems">ecosystems</a>.</p>
<p>In 1987 the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nation's</a> <a href="/wiki/Brundtland_Commission" title="Brundtland Commission">World Commission on Environment and Development</a> (the Brundtland Commission), in its report <i>Our Common Future</i> suggested that development was acceptable, but it must be <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> that would meet the needs of the poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_living" title="Sustainable living">sustainable living</a> by increasing public awareness and adoption of <a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_energies" title="Renewable energies">renewable energies</a> emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_turbines" title="Wind turbines">wind turbines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a> and increased use of <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear energy</a> generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.</p>

<p>Through the work of climate scientists in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IPCC" title="IPCC">IPCC</a> there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human-induced enhanced greenhouse effect, produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels. In March 2009 the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Climate_Council" title="Copenhagen Climate Council">Copenhagen Climate Council</a>, an international team of leading climate scientists, issued a strongly worded statement: "The climate system is already moving beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived.

There is a significant risk that many of the trends will accelerate, leading to an increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climatic shifts."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">Ecological economics</a> now seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and traditional <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_economics" title="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical economics</a>: it provides an inclusive and ethical economic model for society. A plethora of new concepts to help implement and measure sustainability are becoming more widely accepted including: the <a href="/wiki/Car-free_movement" title="Car-free movement">Car-free movement</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smart_Growth" title="Smart Growth">Smart Growth</a> (more sustainable urban environments), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_Cycle_Assessment" title="Life Cycle Assessment">Life Cycle Assessment</a> (the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cradle_to_Cradle_Design" title="Cradle to Cradle Design">Cradle to Cradle</a> analysis of resource use and environmental impact over the life cycle of a product or process), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecological_Footprint" title="Ecological Footprint">Ecological Footprint Analysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Green_building" title="Green building">green building</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dematerialization_(products)" title="Dematerialization (products)">dematerialization</a> (increased recycling of materials), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decarbonisation" title="Decarbonisation">decarbonisation</a> (removing dependence on fossil fuels) and much more.</p>
<p>The work of <a href="/wiki/Bina_Agarwal" title="Bina Agarwal">Bina Agarwal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vandana_Shiva" title="Vandana Shiva">Vandana Shiva</a> amongst many others, has brought some of the cultural wisdom of traditional, sustainable agrarian societies into the academic discourse on sustainability, and also blended that with modern scientific principles. In 2009 the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> of the United States determined that greenhouse gases "endanger public health and welfare" of the American people by contributing to <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> and causing more heat waves, droughts and flooding, and threatening food and water supplies.
