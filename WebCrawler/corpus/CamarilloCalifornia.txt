<p>At the city's incorporation in 1964, a council-manager form of government was created. The five member city council is elected at large for four-year terms. The council is responsible for establishing policy, enacting laws and making legal and financial decisions for the city. A city manager, hired by the council and answerable to it, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the city. He is charged with overall management of the five city departments and 97 full-time employees. Services such as water, sewer, trash collection, street maintenance and traffic engineering are provided by a combination of contractors and city employees.</p>
<p>As of December 2014, the mayor of Camarillo is Bill Little.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pre-Columbian">Pre-Columbian</span></h3>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chumash_(tribe)" title="Chumash (tribe)">Chumash</a> Indians were the first known settlers in what is now known as Ventura County. Fishermen built their villages along the Pacific Coast near the mouths of the Calleguas Creek and Santa Clara River. Artifacts from their settlements are on display in the Ventura County Historical Museum and their paintings are still visible on canyon walls and in caves in the area.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="European_exploration">European exploration</span></h3>
<p>The Portuguese navigator <a href="/wiki/Juan_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Cabrillo" title="Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo">Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo</a>, while exploring the Pacific coast for the king of Spain, came upon the <a href="/wiki/Chumash_people" title="Chumash people">Chumash</a> in an area near <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Point_Mugu" title="Point Mugu">Point Mugu</a>. He explored the surrounding region and claimed it in the name of Spain in 1542. Cabrillo was followed in 1602 by Sebastian Viscaino on a mapping expedition for the King of Spain. The Chumash continued to inhabit the coast until 1768 when Russians, having established a settlement 800 miles (1,300 km) to the north, launched expeditions challenging the Spanish land claims. In the 18th century, the Spanish began settling California and built the first of what would become a chain of 21 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mission_(Christian)" title="Mission (Christian)">missions</a> in San Diego. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Father_Jun%C3%ADpero_Serra" title="Father Junípero Serra">Father Junípero Serra</a> establish the ninth mission in <a href="/wiki/Ventura,_California" title="Ventura, California">Ventura</a> in 1782 bringing more settlers to the area and exposing the Indians who had settled around the mission to many European diseases to which they had no immunity. Their numbers diminished until the Chumash, once the largest Indian nation in California, had largely vanished by 1839.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mexican_independence">Mexican independence</span></h3>
<p>By the early 1820s, Mexico had gained independence from Spain, and shortly afterward California allied itself with Mexico. The Mexican land grant system was liberalized in 1824 resulting in many large grants in California and the proliferation of Ranchos north of the border. One grant to José Pedro Ruiz created <a href="/wiki/Rancho_Calleguas" title="Rancho Calleguas">Rancho Calleguas</a> in 1837, in the area that is now Camarillo. The grant was later sold to Juan Camarillo, who had arrived in 1834 as a member of the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Hijar-Jos%C3%A9_Colony&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hijar-José Colony (page does not exist)">Hijar-Padres Expedition</a>; it was his sons Adolfo and Juan that are credited with the founding of the town that was to bear their name. The earlier proposed name of Calleguas was rejected as too difficult to pronounce.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Springville">Springville</span></h3>
<p>At about same time, the town of Springville had begun to form just to the west of the emerging town of Camarillo on the main road to Ventura which is now the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Wood Road. The Springville Post Office, which was open from 1875 to 1903, was one of seventeen post offices operating in the county in 1890. The Springville School District was established in 1887 and the grammar school was south of the settlement on the main road (now Pleasant Valley Road) to the <a href="/wiki/Port_of_Hueneme" title="Port of Hueneme">new wharf</a> at Hueneme where schooners brought lumber from the north and carried grain, lima beans and sheep to markets in San Francisco. Springville's existence was threatened though when the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad" title="Southern Pacific Railroad">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> Coast Route was routed farther south through Pleasant Valley and a depot was established in nearby Camarillo. The settlement disappeared but in 2012 a new road was named <i>Springville Drive</i> to honor the little town and is now marked on the 101 freeway with an overpass and ramps at the western end of Camarillo. The original settlement would have been nearby on the south side of the freeway.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="St._John.27s_Seminary">St. John's Seminary</span></h3>
<p>In 1927 Don Juan Camarillo, brother of Adolfo, donated 100 acres (0.40 km) to be used as a seminary to be named in honor of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saint_John_the_Evangelist" title="Saint John the Evangelist">Saint John the Evangelist</a>. The Roman Catholic seminary was opened in 1939 as <a href="/wiki/St._John%27s_Seminary_(California)" title="St. John's Seminary (California)">St. John's Seminary</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_growth">Early growth</span></h3>
<p>Camarillo's growth was slow from founding through World War II. In the late 1940s, building lots on <a href="/wiki/Ventura_Boulevard" title="Ventura Boulevard">Ventura Boulevard</a>, the main downtown street, were being offered for $450 and home lots on the adjoining streets were $250, with few buyers. Travel to and from Los Angeles was difficult, owing to the narrow, tortuous road climbing the Conejo Grade to the east of the city.</p>

<p>The main industry during this period was agriculture, and the area surrounding the small town was blanketed with orange, lemon and walnut groves. The State Mental hospital south of the town was the largest employer. A few houses had sprung up to the north and south of town center. The Oxnard Army Air Field, built during World War II to the west of town, the Navy Facility at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Point_Mugu" title="Point Mugu">Point Mugu</a> and the Seabee base at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Port_Hueneme" title="Port Hueneme">Port Hueneme</a> brought many military personnel to the area, but there was little private industry or other source of non-agricultural employment. Oxnard AAF closed at the end of World War II, but the Navy facilities remained open. With the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> and associated <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> tensions, the former Oxnard AAF was reactivated in 1951 as Oxnard Air Force Base.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ventura_Freeway_.28US_Route_101.29">Ventura Freeway (US Route 101)</span></h3>
<p>In the mid-1950s, the <a href="/wiki/Ventura_Freeway" title="Ventura Freeway">Ventura Freeway</a>, which bisects the town, was completed from Los Angeles to points north, making it an easy one-hour trip to Camarillo. The freeway was originally planned to follow the path of Potrero Road, south of Camarillo, which would have completely by-passed the soon-to-be city. However, after much debate, city officials persuaded <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caltrans" title="Caltrans">Caltrans</a> to lay the freeway parallel to Ventura Boulevard, creating the infamously steep descent from the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica_Mountains" title="Santa Monica Mountains">Santa Monica Mountains</a>, known as the <a href="/wiki/Conejo_Grade" title="Conejo Grade">Conejo Grade</a>. The grade is about 2.7 miles (4.3 km) and posted as a 7% grade—which translates as about one thousand feet of elevation change in less than three miles (70 meters per kilometer). There is a <a href="/wiki/California_Highway_Patrol" title="California Highway Patrol">California Highway Patrol</a> brake inspection station at the top of the grade and a stop is mandatory for all 18-wheel trucks. The completion of the freeway facilitated the growth that followed. In 1962, the population was 7,500 and <a href="/wiki/3M" title="3M">3M</a> began construction for the <a href="/wiki/3M" title="3M">Mincom</a> and Magnetic Tape Divisions, which would ultimately employ 900 people, becoming the largest local employer. That plant briefly housed a factory for 3M <a href="/wiki/Corporate_spin-off" title="Corporate spin-off">spinoff</a> <a href="/wiki/Imation" title="Imation">Imation</a> before being closed in 2008. Housing tracts were built where orchards once stood. House prices were $14,000 to $65,000.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Incorporation_in_1964">Incorporation in 1964</span></h3>
<p>At this time plans were made for the incorporation of the city to control the rapid expansion. Camarillo became a city in 1964 and soon put into place a General Plan and building codes that were to lead to an attractive city environment. In 1964 the closest traffic signal was 2 miles (3.2 km) from the City center on the road to Point Mugu, and the first shopping center and supermarket were under construction. Because of the late date of city incorporation, the local telephone exchange is still listed as part of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxnard" title="Oxnard">Oxnard</a>. Much of the city was expected to be developed to the south of Ventura Blvd, however it was to the north that the new city grew, and the land south of Ventura Blvd remains reserved for agricultural use to this day.</p>
<p>Many of the home buyers during the 1960s were military veterans, who had been stationed at one of the local bases during their service. The temperate climate and the living conditions lured them back. With the establishment of both the Pacific Missile Range at NAS Point Mugu and the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory at Port Hueneme many found employment that utilized their military training. Other newcomers were those who worked and lived in the San Fernando Valley and were willing to endure the commute for the opportunity to raise their families in a smog-free, semirural environment. Still others relocated here with their employers, like 3M, and <a href="/wiki/Harbor_Freight_Tools" title="Harbor Freight Tools">Harbor Freight Tools</a> who built facilities in and around the city to take advantage of the large workforce. <a href="/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> Video Services Inc. is the largest DVD duplicator in the world. The members of the original city council (1964) were Ned Chatfield, Stan Daily, Earl Joseph, Tweedy Rouce &amp; Guy Turner.</p>
