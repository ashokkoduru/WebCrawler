<p>A <b>fertilizer</b> (American English) or <b>fertiliser</b> (British English) is any material of natural or synthetic origin (other than <a href="/wiki/Liming_(soil)" title="Liming (soil)">liming materials</a>) that is applied to soils or to plant tissues (usually leaves) to supply one or more <a href="/wiki/Plant_nutrition" title="Plant nutrition">plant nutrients</a> essential to the growth of <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanism">Mechanism</span></h2>

<p>Fertilizers enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients. The second mode by some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration. This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect. Fertilizers typically provide, in varying <a href="/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)" title="Proportionality (mathematics)">proportions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>three main macronutrients:
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">Nitrogen</a> (N): leaf growth;</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">Phosphorus</a> (P): Development of roots, flowers, seeds, fruit;</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">Potassium</a> (K): Strong stem growth, movement of water in plants, promotion of flowering and fruiting;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>three secondary macronutrients: <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> (Ca), <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> (Mg), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sulphur" title="Sulphur">sulphur</a> (S);</li>
<li>micronutrients: <a href="/wiki/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a> (Cu), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iron_fertilisation" title="Iron fertilisation">iron</a> (Fe), <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a> (Mn), <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a> (Mo), <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a> (Zn), <a href="/wiki/Boron" title="Boron">boron</a> (B), and of occasional significance there are <a href="/wiki/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a> (Si), <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> (Co), and <a href="/wiki/Vanadium" title="Vanadium">vanadium</a> (V) plus rare mineral catalysts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements, but the elements are not used as fertilizers. Instead <a href="/wiki/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">compounds</a> containing these elements are the basis of fertilisers. The macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a <a href="/wiki/Dry_matter" title="Dry matter">dry matter</a> (DM) (0% moisture) basis. Plants are made up of four main elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are widely available as water and carbon dioxide. Although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere, it is in a form that is unavailable to plants. Nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>, <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> and other components (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Chlorophyll" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a>). To be nutritious to plants, nitrogen must be made available in a "fixed" form. Only some bacteria and their host plants (notably <a href="/wiki/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a>) can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) by converting it to <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>. Phosphate is required for the production of DNA and <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>, the main energy carrier in cells, as well as certain lipids.</p>
<p>Micronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of <a href="/wiki/Parts-per_notation" title="Parts-per notation">parts-per-million</a> (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm DM, or less than 0.04% DM. These elements are often present at the active sites of enzymes that carry out the plant's metabolism. Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes) their impact far exceeds their weight percentage.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<p>Fertilizers are classified in several ways. They are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient (say, N, P, or K), in which case they are classified as "straight fertilizers." "Multinutrient fertilizers" (or "complex fertilizers") provide two or more nutrients, for example N and P. Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic. Inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ureas" title="Ureas">ureas</a>. Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter. Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Single_nutrient_.28.22straight.22.29_fertilizers">Single nutrient ("straight") fertilizers</span></h3>
<p>The main nitrogen-based straight fertilizer is ammonia or its solutions. <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate" title="Ammonium nitrate">Ammonium nitrate</a> (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is also widely used. About 15M tons were produced in 1981. <a href="/wiki/Urea" title="Urea">Urea</a> is another popular source of nitrogen, having the advantage that it is a solid and non-explosive, unlike ammonia and ammonium nitrate, respectively. A few percent of the nitrogen fertilizer market (4% in 2007) has been met by <a href="/wiki/Calcium_ammonium_nitrate" title="Calcium ammonium nitrate">calcium ammonium nitrate</a> (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>•NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>•10H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
<p>The main straight phosphate fertilizers are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superphosphate" title="Superphosphate">superphosphates</a>. "Single superphosphate" (SSP) consists of 14–18% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, again in the form of Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, but also <a href="/wiki/Phosphogypsum" title="Phosphogypsum">phosphogypsum</a> (CaSO<sub>4</sub> · 2 H<sub>2</sub>O). <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triple_superphosphate" title="Triple superphosphate">Triple superphosphate</a> (TSP) typically consists of 44-48% of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and no gypsum. A mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate. More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Multinutrient_fertilizers">Multinutrient fertilizers</span></h3>
<p>These fertilizers are the most common. They consist of two or more nutrient components.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Binary_.28NP.2C_NK.2C_PK.29_fertilizers">Binary (NP, NK, PK) fertilizers</span></h4>
<p>Major two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monoammonium_phosphate" title="Monoammonium phosphate">monoammonium phosphate</a> (MAP) and <a href="/wiki/Diammonium_phosphate" title="Diammonium phosphate">diammonium phosphate</a> (DAP). The active ingredient in MAP is NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The active ingredient in DAP is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. About 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="NPK_fertilizers">NPK fertilizers</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Labeling_of_fertilizer" title="Labeling of fertilizer">Labeling of fertilizer</a></div>
<p>NPK fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NPK_rating" title="NPK rating">NPK rating</a> is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers. The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; the third, K<sub>2</sub>O. Fertilizers do not actually contain P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> or K<sub>2</sub>O, but the system is a conventional shorthand for the amount of the phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) in a fertilizer. A 50-pound (23 kg) bag of fertilizer labeled 16-4-8 contains 8 lb (3.6 kg) of nitrogen (16% of the 50 pounds), an amount of phosphorus equivalent to that in 2 pounds of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (4% of 50 pounds), and 4 pounds of K<sub>2</sub>O (8% of 50 pounds). Most fertilizers are labeled according to this N-P-K convention, although Australian convention, following an N-P-K-S system, adds a fourth number for sulfur.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Micronutrients">Micronutrients</span></h3>
<p>The main micronutrients are molybdenum, zinc, and copper. These elements are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a <a href="/wiki/Chelation" title="Chelation">chelate complex</a>, e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid" title="Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid">EDTA</a> derivative. The micronutrient needs depend on the plant. For example, <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beets</a> appear to require <a href="/wiki/Boron" title="Boron">boron</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a> require <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nitrogen_fertilizers">Nitrogen fertilizers</span></h3>

<p>Nitrogen fertilizers are made from <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> (NH<sub>3</sub>), which is sometimes injected into the ground directly. The ammonia is produced by the <a href="/wiki/Haber_process" title="Haber process">Haber-Bosch process</a>. In this energy-intensive process, <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> (CH<sub>4</sub>) supplies the hydrogen, and the nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is derived from the air. This ammonia is used as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feedstock" title="Feedstock">feedstock</a> for all other nitrogen fertilizers, such as <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate" title="Ammonium nitrate">anhydrous ammonium nitrate</a> (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) and <a href="/wiki/Urea" title="Urea">urea</a> (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Deposits of <a href="/wiki/Sodium_nitrate" title="Sodium nitrate">sodium nitrate</a> (NaNO<sub>3</sub>) (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chilean_saltpeter" title="Chilean saltpeter">Chilean saltpeter</a>) are also found in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atacama_desert" title="Atacama desert">Atacama desert</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a> and was one of the original (1830) nitrogen-rich fertilizers used. It is still mined for fertilizer.</p>
<p>There has been technical work investigating on-site (on-farm) synthesis of nitrate fertilizer using solar <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> power, which would enable farmers more control in soil fertility, while using far less surface area than conventional <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a> for nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Phosphate_fertilizers">Phosphate fertilizers</span></h3>

<p>All phosphate fertilizers are obtained by extraction from minerals containing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anion" title="Anion">anion</a> PO<sub>4</sub>. In rare cases, fields are treated with the crushed mineral, but most often more soluble salts are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals. The most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phosphate_rock" title="Phosphate rock">phosphate rock</a>. The main minerals are <a href="/wiki/Fluorapatite" title="Fluorapatite">fluorapatite</a> Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>F (CFA) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroxyapatite" title="Hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH. These minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with sulfuric or <a href="/wiki/Phosphoric_acid" title="Phosphoric acid">phosphoric acids</a>. The large production of <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer. The global primary uses for both <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> compounds relate to this basic process.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Nitrophosphate_process" title="Nitrophosphate process">nitrophosphate process</a> or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a> (HNO<sub>3</sub>) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and <a href="/wiki/Calcium_nitrate" title="Calcium nitrate">calcium nitrate</a> (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a <i>compound fertilizer</i> with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Potassium_fertilizers">Potassium fertilizers</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Potash" title="Potash">Potash</a> is a mixture of potassium minerals used to make potassium (chemical symbol: K) fertilizers. Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove <a href="/wiki/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">sodium chloride</a> (NaCl) (common <a href="/wiki/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a>). Sometimes potash is referred to as K<sub>2</sub>O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content. In fact potash fertilizers are usually <a href="/wiki/Potassium_chloride" title="Potassium chloride">potassium chloride</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potassium_sulfate" title="Potassium sulfate">potassium sulfate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potassium_carbonate" title="Potassium carbonate">potassium carbonate</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Potassium_nitrate" title="Potassium nitrate">potassium nitrate</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Compound_fertilizers">Compound fertilizers</span></h3>
<p>Compound fertilizers, which contain N, P, and K, can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers. In some cases, chemical reactions occur between the two or more components. For example, monoammonium and diammonium phosphates, which provide plants with both N and P, are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid (from phosphate rock) and ammonia :</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Organic_fertilizers">Organic fertilizers</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Organic_fertilizer" title="Organic fertilizer">Organic fertilizer</a></div>


<p>The main "organic fertilizers" are <a href="/wiki/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manure" title="Manure">animal wastes</a>, plant wastes from agriculture, and treated <a href="/wiki/Sewage_sludge" title="Sewage sludge">sewage sludge</a> (<a href="/wiki/Biosolids" title="Biosolids">biosolid</a>s). In terms of volume, peat is the most widely used organic fertilizer. This immature form of coal confers no nutritional value to the plants, but improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water. Animal sources include the products of the slaughter of animals. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bloodmeal" title="Bloodmeal">Bloodmeal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bone_meal" title="Bone meal">bone meal</a>, hides, hoofs, and horns are typical components. <a href="/wiki/Organic_fertilizer" title="Organic fertilizer">Organic fertilizer</a> usually contain fewer nutrients, but offer other advantages as well as being appealing to those who are trying to practice "<a href="/wiki/Environmentally_friendly" title="Environmentally friendly">environmentally friendly</a>" farming.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_elements:_calcium.2C_magnesium.2C_and_sulfur">Other elements: calcium, magnesium, and sulfur</span></h3>
<p>Calcium is supplied as superphosphate or calcium ammonium nitrate solutions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Application">Application</span></h2>
<p>Fertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a <a href="/wiki/Soil_test" title="Soil test">soil test</a> and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Liquid_vs_solid">Liquid vs solid</span></h3>
<p>Fertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid. About 90% of fertilizers are applied as solids. Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered. Often solids are available as <a href="/wiki/Prill" title="Prill">prills</a>, a solid globule. Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea. These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., <a href="/wiki/UAN" title="UAN">UAN</a>). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage. The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called "<a href="/wiki/Fertigation" title="Fertigation">fertigation</a>".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slow-_and_controlled-release_fertilizers">Slow- and controlled-release fertilizers</span></h3>
<p>Slow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15% (562,000 tons) of the fertilizer market (1995). Their utility stems from the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes. In addition to their providing the nutrition to plants, excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant. Competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer. Microbes degrade many fertilizers, e.g., by immobilization or oxidation. Furthermore, fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching. Most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea, a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen. <a href="/wiki/Isobutylidenediurea" title="Isobutylidenediurea">Isobutylidenediurea</a> ("IBDU") and urea-formaldehyde slowly convert in the soil to free urea, which is rapidly uptaken by plants. IBDU is a single compound with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH(NHC(O)NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula (HOCH<sub>2</sub>NHC(O)NH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Besides being more efficient in the utilization of the applied nutrients, slow-release technologies also reduce the impact on the environment and the contamination of the subsurface water. Slow-release fertilizers (various forms including fertilizer spikes, tabs, etc.) which reduce the problem of "burning" the plants due to excess nitrogen. Polymer coating of fertilizer ingredients gives tablets and spikes a <a class="external text" href="http://www.agritab.com" rel="nofollow">'true time-release'</a> or 'staged nutrient release' (SNR) of fertilizer nutrients.</p>
<p>Controlled release fertilizers are traditional fertilizers encapsulated in a shell that degrades at a specified rate. Sulfur is a typical encapsulation material. Other coated products use thermoplastics (and sometimes ethylene-vinyl acetate and surfactants, etc.) to produce diffusion-controlled release of <a href="/wiki/Urea" title="Urea">urea</a> or other fertilizers. "Reactive Layer Coating" can produce thinner, hence cheaper, membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles. "Multicote" is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin topcoat.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Foliar_application">Foliar application</span></h3>
<p>Foliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves. The method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high value crops such as fruits.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemicals_that_affect_nitrogen_uptake">Chemicals that affect nitrogen uptake</span></h3>
<p>Various chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers. In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off. Nitrification inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching. 1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dicyandiamide" title="Dicyandiamide">dicyandiamide</a>, and nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) are popular. Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification. The conversion of urea to ammonia catalyzed by enzymes called <a href="/wiki/Urease" title="Urease">ureases</a>. A popular inhibitor of ureases is N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overfertilization">Overfertilization</span></h3>
<p>Careful fertilization technologies are important because excess nutrients can be as detrimental. <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer_burn" title="Fertilizer burn">Fertilizer burn</a> can occur when too much fertilizer is applied, resulting in drying out of the leaves and damage or even death of the plant. Fertilizers vary in their tendency to burn roughly in accordance with their <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Salt_index&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Salt index (page does not exist)">salt index</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statistics">Statistics</span></h2>

<p>Conservative estimates report 30 to 50% of crop yields are attributed to natural or synthetic commercial fertilizer. <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">Global market</a> value is likely to rise to more than US$185 billion until 2019.

<p>Agricultural run-off is a major contributor to the eutrophication of fresh water bodies. For example, in the US, about half of all the lakes are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eutrophic" title="Eutrophic">eutrophic</a>. The main contributor to eutrophication is phosphate, which is normally a limiting nutrient; high concentrations promote the growth of cyanobacteria and algae, the demise of which consumes oxygen. Cyanobacteria blooms ('<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Algal_blooms" title="Algal blooms">algal blooms</a>') can also produce harmful <a href="/wiki/Eutrophication#toxicity" title="Eutrophication">toxins</a> that can accumulate in the food chain, and can be harmful to humans.</p>
<p>The nitrogen-rich compounds found in fertilizer runoff are the primary cause of serious oxygen depletion in many parts of <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a>, especially in coastal zones, <a href="/wiki/Lake" title="Lake">lakes</a> and <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">rivers</a>.

The number of oceanic <a href="/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)" title="Dead zone (ecology)">dead zones</a> near inhabited coastlines are increasing. As of 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is being increasingly controlled in northwestern Europe and the United States. If eutrophication <i>can</i> be reversed, it may take decades before the accumulated nitrates in <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> can be broken down by natural processes.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Nitrate_pollution">Nitrate pollution</span></h4>
<p>Only a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_solubility" title="Water solubility">water solubility</a> of nitrate leads to increased <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff#Agricultural_issues" title="Surface runoff">runoff</a> into <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Leaching_(agriculture)" title="Leaching (agriculture)">leaching</a> into groundwater, thereby causing <a href="/wiki/Groundwater_pollution" title="Groundwater pollution">groundwater pollution</a>. The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached.</p>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Cadmium">Cadmium</span></h5>
<p>The concentration of <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> in phosphorus-containing fertilizers varies considerably and can be problematic. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14 mg/kg or as high as 50.9 mg/kg. This is because the phosphate rock used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188 mg/kg cadmium (examples are deposits on <a href="/wiki/Nauru" title="Nauru">Nauru</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christmas_island" title="Christmas island">Christmas islands</a>). Continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil (as shown in New Zealand) and plants. Limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>. Producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select phosphate rock based on the cadmium content.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Fluoride">Fluoride</span></h5>
<p>Phosphate rocks contain high levels of fluoride. Consequently, the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of little concern as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils. Also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Radioactive_elements">Radioactive elements</span></h5>
<p>The radioactive content of the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process. Uranium-238 concentrations range can range from 7 to 100 pCi/g in phosphate rock and from 1 to 67 pCi/g in phosphate fertilizers. Where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used, this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present. However, the impact of these increases on the <a href="/wiki/Sievert#Dose_examples" title="Sievert">risk to human health</a> from radinuclide contamination of foods is very small (less than 0.05 m<a href="/wiki/Sievert" title="Sievert">Sv</a>/y).</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_metals">Other metals</span></h5>
<p>Steel industry wastes, recycled into fertilizers for their high levels of <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a> (essential to plant growth), wastes can include the following toxic metals: lead <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a>, chromium, and nickel. The most common toxic elements in this type of fertilizer are mercury, lead, and arsenic. These potentially harmful impurities can be removed; however, this significantly increases cost. Highly pure fertilizers are widely available and perhaps best known as the highly water-soluble fertilizers containing blue dyes used around households, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miracle-Gro" title="Miracle-Gro">Miracle-Gro</a>. These highly water-soluble fertilizers are used in the plant nursery business and are available in larger packages at significantly less cost than retail quantities. There are also some inexpensive retail granular garden fertilizers made with high purity ingredients.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Trace_mineral_depletion">Trace mineral depletion</span></h4>
<p>Attention has been addressed to the decreasing concentrations of elements such as iron, zinc, copper and magnesium in many foods over the last 50–60 years. Intensive farming practices, including the use of synthetic fertilizers are frequently suggested as reasons for these declines and organic farming is often suggested as a solution. Although improved crop yields resulting from NPK fertilizers are known to dilute the concentrations of other nutrients in plants, much of the measured decline can be attributed to the use of progressively higher-yielding crop varieties which produce foods with lower mineral concentrations than their less productive ancestors. It is, therefore, unlikely that organic farming or reduced use of fertilizers will solve the problem; foods with high nutrient density are posited to be achieved using older, lower-yielding varieties or the development of new high-yield, nutrient-dense varieties.</p>
<p>Fertilizers are, in fact, more likely to solve trace mineral deficiency problems than cause them: In Western Australia deficiencies of <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, copper, <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, iron and <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a> were identified as limiting the growth of broad-acre crops and pastures in the 1940s and 1950s. Soils in Western Australia are very old, highly weathered and deficient in many of the major nutrients and trace elements. Since this time these trace elements are routinely added to fertilizers used in agriculture in this state. Many other soils around the world are deficient in zinc, leading to deficiency in both plants and humans, and zinc fertilizers are widely used to solve this problem.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_in_soil_biology">Changes in soil biology</span></h4>
<p>High levels of fertilizer may cause the breakdown of the <a href="/wiki/Symbiosis" title="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationships between plant roots and <a href="/wiki/Mycorrhiza" title="Mycorrhiza">mycorrhizal</a> fungi.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_consumption_and_sustainability">Energy consumption and sustainability</span></h3>
<p>In the USA in 2004, 317 billion cubic feet of natural gas were consumed in the industrial <a href="/wiki/Ammonia_production" title="Ammonia production">production of ammonia</a>, less than 1.5% of total U.S. <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_consumption" title="List of countries by natural gas consumption">annual consumption of natural gas</a>. A 2002 report suggested that the production of ammonia consumes about 5% of global natural gas consumption, which is somewhat under 2% of world energy production.</p>
<p>Ammonia is produced from <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> and air. The cost of natural gas makes up about 90% of the cost of producing ammonia. The increase in price of natural gases over the past decade, along with other factors such as increasing demand, have contributed to an increase in fertilizer price.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Contribution_to_climate_change">Contribution to climate change</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> are produced during the <a href="/wiki/Haber_process" title="Haber process">manufacture</a> of nitrogen fertilizer. The effects can be combined into an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The amount varies according to the efficiency of the process. The figure for the United Kingdom is over 2 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide equivalent for each kilogramme of ammonium nitrate. Nitrogen fertilizer can be converted by <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide#Soil" title="Nitrous oxide">soil bacteria</a> to <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Atmosphere">Atmosphere</span></h3>

<p>Through the increasing use of nitrogen fertilizer, which was used at a rate of about 110 million tons (of N) per year in 2012, adding to the already existing amount of reactive nitrogen, <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) has become the third most important <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> after carbon dioxide and methane. It has a global warming potential 296 times larger than an equal mass of carbon dioxide and it also contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion. By changing processes and procedures, it is possible to mitigate some, but not all, of these effects on anthropogenic <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>.</p>
<p>Methane emissions from crop fields (notably rice <a href="/wiki/Paddy_field" title="Paddy field">paddy fields</a>) are increased by the application of ammonium-based fertilizers. These emissions contribute to global climate change as methane is a potent greenhouse gas.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulation">Regulation</span></h3>
<p>In Europe problems with high nitrate concentrations in run-off are being addressed by the European Union's Nitrates Directive. Within Britain, farmers are encouraged to manage their land more sustainably in 'catchment-sensitive farming'. In the US, high concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in runoff and drainage water are classified as non-point source pollutants due to their diffuse origin; this pollution is regulated at state level. Oregon and Washington, both in the United States, have fertilizer registration programs with on-line databases listing chemical analyses of fertilizers.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_fertilizer" title="History of fertilizer">History of fertilizer</a></div>
<p>Management of <a href="/wiki/Soil_fertility" title="Soil fertility">soil fertility</a> has been the preoccupation of farmers for thousands of years. Egyptians, Romans, Babylonians, and early Germans all are recorded as using minerals and or manure to enhance the productivity of their farms. The modern science of plant nutrition started in the 19th century and the work of German chemist <a href="/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig" title="Justus von Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a>, among others. <a href="/wiki/John_Bennet_Lawes" title="John Bennet Lawes">John Bennet Lawes</a>, an English <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a>, began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field. One immediate consequence was that in 1842 he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid, and thus was the first to create the artificial manure industry. In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Henry_Gilbert" title="Joseph Henry Gilbert">Joseph Henry Gilbert</a>, with whom he carried on for more than half a century on experiments in raising crops at the <a href="/wiki/Rothamsted_Research" title="Rothamsted Research">Institute of Arable Crops Research</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Birkeland%E2%80%93Eyde_process" title="Birkeland–Eyde process">Birkeland–Eyde process</a> was one of the competing industrial processes in the beginning of nitrogen based fertilizer production. This process was used to fix atmospheric <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> (N<sub>2</sub>) into <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a> (HNO<sub>3</sub>), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of <a href="/wiki/Nitrate" title="Nitrate">nitrate</a> (NO<sub>3</sub>). A factory based on the process was built in <a href="/wiki/Rjukan" title="Rjukan">Rjukan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Notodden" title="Notodden">Notodden</a> in Norway, combined with the building of large <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a> facilities.</p>
<p>The 1910s and 1920s witness the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Haber_process" title="Haber process">Haber process</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ostwald_process" title="Ostwald process">Ostwald process</a>. The Haber process produces ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) from <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> (CH<sub>4</sub>) gas and molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). The ammonia from the Haber process is then converted into <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a> (HNO<sub>3</sub>) in the <a href="/wiki/Ostwald_process" title="Ostwald process">Ostwald process</a>. The development of synthetic fertilizer has significantly supported global <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a> — it has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use.</p>
<p>The use of commercial fertilizers has increased steadily in the last 50 years, rising almost 20-fold to the current rate of 100 million <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tonnes" title="Tonnes">tonnes</a> of nitrogen per year. Without commercial fertilizers it is estimated that about one-third of the food produced now could not be produced. The use of phosphate fertilizers has also increased from 9 million tonnes per year in 1960 to 40 million tonnes per year in 2000. A maize crop yielding 6–9 tonnes of grain per <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectare</a> (2.5 acres) requires 31–50 kilograms (68–110 lb) of <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a> fertilizer to be applied; soybean crops require about half, as 20–25 kg per hectare. <a href="/wiki/Yara_International" title="Yara International">Yara International</a> is the world's largest producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers.</p>
<p>Controlled-nitrogen-release technologies based on polymers derived from combining urea and formaldehyde were first produced in 1936 and commercialized in 1955. The early product had 60 percent of the total nitrogen cold-water-insoluble, and the unreacted (quick-release) less than 15%. Methylene <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ureas" title="Ureas">ureas</a> were commercialized in the 1960s and 1970s, having 25% and 60% of the nitrogen as cold-water-insoluble, and unreacted urea nitrogen in the range of 15% to 30%.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority" title="Tennessee Valley Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> National Fertilizer Development Center began developing sulfur-coated urea; sulfur was used as the principal coating material because of its low cost and its value as a secondary nutrient. Usually there is another wax or polymer which seals the sulfur; the slow-release properties depend on the degradation of the secondary sealant by soil microbes as well as mechanical imperfections (cracks, etc.) in the sulfur. They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.</p>
