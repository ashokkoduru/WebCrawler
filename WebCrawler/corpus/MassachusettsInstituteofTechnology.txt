<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Foundation_and_vision">Foundation and vision</span></h3>



<p>In 1859, a proposal was submitted to the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court" title="Massachusetts General Court">Massachusetts General Court</a> to use newly filled lands in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Back_Bay,_Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts">Back Bay</a>, Boston for a "<a href="/wiki/Conservatoire_national_des_arts_et_m%C3%A9tiers" title="Conservatoire national des arts et métiers">Conservatory of Art and Science</a>", but the proposal failed. A charter for the <a href="/wiki/Incorporation_(business)" title="Incorporation (business)">incorporation</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by <a href="/wiki/William_Barton_Rogers" title="William Barton Rogers">William Barton Rogers</a>, was signed by the <a href="/wiki/John_Albion_Andrew" title="John Albion Andrew">governor of Massachusetts</a> on April 10, 1861.</p>
<p>Rogers, a professor from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia" title="University of Virginia">University of Virginia</a>, wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances. He did not wish to found a <a href="/wiki/Vocational_education" title="Vocational education">professional school</a>, but a combination with elements of both professional and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_education" title="Liberal education">liberal education</a>, proposing that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rogers Plan reflected the <a href="/wiki/History_of_European_research_universities#European_university_models_in_the_19th_and_20th_centuries" title="History of European research universities">German research university model</a>, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_developments">Early developments</span></h3>

<p>Two days after the charter was issued, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter" title="Battle of Fort Sumter">first battle</a> of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865. The new institute was founded as part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Morrill_Land-Grant_Colleges_Act" title="Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act">Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a> to fund institutions "to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes", and was a land-grant school. In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst#History" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">Massachusetts Agricultural College</a>, which developed as the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.</p>
<p>MIT was informally called "Boston Tech". The institute adopted the <a href="/wiki/History_of_European_research_universities" title="History of European research universities">European polytechnic university model</a> and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date. Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President <a href="/wiki/Francis_Amasa_Walker" title="Francis Amasa Walker">Francis Amasa Walker</a>. Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced, new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.</p>
<p>The curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science. The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these "Boston Tech" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> president (and former MIT faculty) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charles_W._Eliot" title="Charles W. Eliot">Charles W. Eliot</a>'s repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lawrence_Scientific_School" title="Lawrence Scientific School">Lawrence Scientific School</a>. There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard. In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni. However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.</p>

<p>In 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge <i>Bucentaur</i> built for the occasion, to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of <a href="/wiki/Land_reclamation" title="Land reclamation">filled land</a> on a mile-long tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River. The <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture" title="Neoclassical architecture">neoclassical</a> "New Technology" campus was designed by <a href="/wiki/William_W._Bosworth" title="William W. Bosworth">William W. Bosworth</a> and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious "Mr. Smith", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist <a href="/wiki/George_Eastman" title="George Eastman">George Eastman</a> of <a href="/wiki/Rochester,_New_York" title="Rochester, New York">Rochester, New York</a>, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eastman_Kodak" title="Eastman Kodak">Eastman Kodak</a>. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Curricular_reforms">Curricular reforms</span></h3>
<p>In the 1930s, President <a href="/wiki/Karl_Taylor_Compton" title="Karl Taylor Compton">Karl Taylor Compton</a> and Vice-President (effectively <a href="/wiki/Provost_(education)" title="Provost (education)">Provost</a>) <a href="/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios. The Compton reforms "renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering." Unlike <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tuition" title="Tuition">tuition</a> than on <a href="/wiki/Financial_endowment" title="Financial endowment">endowments</a> or <a href="/wiki/Grant_(money)" title="Grant (money)">grants</a> for its funding. The school was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities" title="Association of American Universities">Association of American Universities</a> in 1934.</p>
<p>Still, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that "the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school", a "partly unjustified" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities. The <a href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Humanities,_Arts,_and_Social_Sciences" title="MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences">School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</a> and the <a href="/wiki/MIT_Sloan_School_of_Management" title="MIT Sloan School of Management">MIT Sloan School of Management</a> were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Science" title="MIT School of Science">Science</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Engineering" title="MIT School of Engineering">Engineering</a>. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs. The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">humanistically oriented</a> presidents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Howard_W._Johnson" title="Howard W. Johnson">Howard W. Johnson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Wiesner" title="Jerome Wiesner">Jerome Wiesner</a> between 1966 and 1980.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Defense_research">Defense research</span></h3>
<p>MIT's involvement in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Military_funding_of_science" title="Military funding of science">military research</a> surged during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. In 1941, <a href="/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> was appointed head of the federal <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Scientific_Research_and_Development" title="Office of Scientific Research and Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT. Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radiation_Laboratory" title="Radiation Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a>, established in 1940 to assist the <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_World_War_II" title="Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II">British military</a> in developing <a href="/wiki/Cavity_magnetron" title="Cavity magnetron">microwave</a> <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a>. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area. Other defense projects included <a href="/wiki/Gyroscope" title="Gyroscope">gyroscope</a>-based and other complex <a href="/wiki/Control_system" title="Control system">control systems</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gunsight" title="Gunsight">gunsight</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bombsight" title="Bombsight">bombsight</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inertial_navigation" title="Inertial navigation">inertial navigation</a> under <a href="/wiki/Charles_Stark_Draper" title="Charles Stark Draper">Charles Stark Draper</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Charles_Stark_Draper_Laboratory" title="Charles Stark Draper Laboratory">Instrumentation Laboratory</a>; the development of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_computer" title="Digital computer">digital computer</a> for flight simulations under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Project_Whirlwind" title="Project Whirlwind">Project Whirlwind</a>; and <a href="/wiki/High-speed_photography" title="High-speed photography">high-speed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Espionage_balloon" title="Espionage balloon">high-altitude</a> photography under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harold_Edgerton" title="Harold Edgerton">Harold Edgerton</a>. By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&amp;D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush), employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946. Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Research_funding" title="Research funding">government-sponsored research</a> at MIT included <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi_Automatic_Ground_Environment" title="Semi Automatic Ground Environment">SAGE</a> and guidance systems for <a href="/wiki/Ballistic_missile" title="Ballistic missile">ballistic missiles</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Project_Apollo" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a>.</p>

<p>These activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of "any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the "academic tranquility of the prewar years", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities. The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Taylor_Compton" title="Karl Taylor Compton">Karl Taylor Compton</a>, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; <a href="/wiki/James_Rhyne_Killian" title="James Rhyne Killian">James Rhyne Killian</a>, president from 1948 to 1957; and <a href="/wiki/Julius_Adams_Stratton" title="Julius Adams Stratton">Julius Adams Stratton</a>, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.</p>
<p>In late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> and MIT's defense research. In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles. The <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Concerned_Scientists" title="Union of Concerned Scientists">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems. MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lincoln_Laboratory" title="Lincoln Laboratory">Lincoln Laboratory</a> facility in 1973 in response to the protests. The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities. Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to "greater strength and unity" after these times of turmoil. However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as <a href="/wiki/Michael_Albert" title="Michael Albert">Michael Albert</a> and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests. (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Leacock" title="Richard Leacock">Richard Leacock</a>'s film, <i>November Actions</i>, records some of these tumultuous events.)</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_history">Recent history</span></h3>

<p>MIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">networking</a> technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Project_MAC" title="Project MAC">Project MAC</a>, the <a href="/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory" title="MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory">Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club" title="Tech Model Railroad Club">Tech Model Railroad Club</a> wrote some of the earliest interactive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_video_game" title="Computer video game">computer video games</a> like <i><a href="/wiki/Spacewar!" title="Spacewar!">Spacewar!</a></i> and created much of modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)" title="Hacker (programmer subculture)">hacker</a> <a href="/wiki/Jargon_File" title="Jargon File">slang</a> and culture. Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: <a href="/wiki/Richard_Stallman" title="Richard Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>'s <a href="/wiki/GNU_Project" title="GNU Project">GNU Project</a> and the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the <a href="/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab" title="MIT Media Lab">MIT Media Lab</a> was founded in 1985 by <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte" title="Nicholas Negroponte">Nicholas Negroponte</a> and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" title="World Wide Web Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> <a href="/wiki/Standards_organization" title="Standards organization">standards organization</a> was founded at the <a href="/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory" title="MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory">Laboratory for Computer Science</a> in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>; the <a href="/wiki/MIT_OpenCourseWare" title="MIT OpenCourseWare">OpenCourseWare</a> project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the <a href="/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child" title="One Laptop per Child">One Laptop per Child</a> initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.</p>
<p>MIT was named a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea-grant_college" title="Sea-grant college">sea-grant college</a> in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space-grant_college" title="Space-grant college">space-grant college</a> in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs. Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful <a href="/wiki/Fundraising" title="Fundraising">development campaigns</a> to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the <a href="/wiki/Campus_of_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#Tang_Center_for_Management_Education" title="Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Tang Center for Management Education</a>; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into <a href="/wiki/Campus_of_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#Koch_Biology_Building_.281994.29" title="Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology">biology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Campus_of_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#Brain_and_Cognitive_Sciences_Building_.282006.29" title="Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology">brain and cognitive sciences</a>, <a href="/wiki/Broad_Institute" title="Broad Institute">genomics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Whitehead_Institute" title="Whitehead Institute">biotechnology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/David_H._Koch_Institute_for_Integrative_Cancer_Research#Building" title="David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research">cancer research</a>; and a number of new "backlot" buildings on Vassar Street including the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stata_Center" title="Stata Center">Stata Center</a>. Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest. In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption" title="World energy resources and consumption">global energy consumption</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001, inspired by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_source_movement" title="Open source movement">open source</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_access_movement" title="Open access movement">open access movements</a>, MIT launched <a href="/wiki/MIT_OpenCourseWare" title="MIT OpenCourseWare">OpenCourseWare</a> to make the lecture notes, <a href="/wiki/Problem_set" title="Problem set">problem sets</a>, syllabuses, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed. While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high, OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages. In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its "MITx" program, for a modest fee. The "<a href="/wiki/EdX" title="EdX">edX</a>" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a> and its analogous "Harvardx" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.</p>
<p>Three days after the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing" title="Boston Marathon bombing">Boston Marathon bombing</a> of April 2013, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_Police_Department" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department">MIT Police</a> patrol officer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sean_Collier" title="Sean Collier">Sean Collier</a> was fatally shot by the suspects <a href="/wiki/Dzhokhar_Tsarnaev" title="Dzhokhar Tsarnaev">Dzhokhar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tamerlan_Tsarnaev" title="Tamerlan Tsarnaev">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a>, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day. One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada. On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to "an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life". The announcement further stated that "Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness".</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/MIT_Nuclear_Research_Reactor" title="MIT Nuclear Research Reactor">MIT's on-campus nuclear reactor</a> is one of the most powerful university-based <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactors</a> in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial, but MIT maintains that it is well-secured. In 1999 <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gates" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H.

While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.</p>
<p>Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized <a href="/wiki/Wind_tunnel" title="Wind tunnel">wind tunnel</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Ship_model_basin" title="Ship model basin">towing tank</a> for testing ship and ocean structure designs. MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9,400,000 square feet (870,000 m) of campus.</p>
<p>In 2001, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> sued MIT for violating the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Water_Act" title="Clean Water Act">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)" title="Clean Air Act (United States)">Clean Air Act</a> with regard to its <a href="/wiki/Hazardous_waste" title="Hazardous waste">hazardous waste</a> storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running <a href="/wiki/Alternative_fuel" title="Alternative fuel">alternative fuel</a> campus shuttles, subsidizing <a href="/wiki/CharlieCard" title="CharlieCard">public transportation passes</a>, and building a low-emission <a href="/wiki/Cogeneration" title="Cogeneration">cogeneration</a> plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_Police_Department" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department">MIT Police</a> with state and local authorities, in the 2009-2011 period, have investigated reports of 12 forcible sex offenses, 6 robberies, 3 aggravated assaults, 164 burglaries, 1 case of arson, and 4 cases of motor vehicle theft on campus; affecting a community of around 22,000 students and employees.</p>
<p>MIT also has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge, on which it pays property taxes. This includes Technology Square, parts of <a href="/wiki/Kendall_Square" title="Kendall Square">Kendall Square</a>, and many properties in <a href="/wiki/Cambridgeport,_Cambridge" title="Cambridgeport, Cambridge">Cambridgeport</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Area_4,_Cambridge" title="Area 4, Cambridge">Area 4</a> neighboring the educational buildings.

<p>Undergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 12 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_MIT_undergraduate_dormitories" title="List of MIT undergraduate dormitories">undergraduate dormitories</a>. Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters. Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the <i>Yale Daily News</i> staff's <i>The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010</i>, "The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture." MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.</p>
<p>MIT has an active Greek and <a href="/wiki/Student_housing_cooperative" title="Student housing cooperative">co-op housing</a> system, including thirty-six <a href="/wiki/Fraternity" title="Fraternity">fraternities</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sorority" title="Sorority">sororities</a>, and independent living groups (FSILGs). As of 2015, 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities. Most FSILGs are located across the river in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Back_Bay" title="Back Bay">Back Bay</a> near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin. After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the <a href="/wiki/Phi_Gamma_Delta" title="Phi Gamma Delta">Phi Gamma Delta</a> fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002. Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_MIT_undergraduate_dormitories#Simmons_Hall" title="List of MIT undergraduate dormitories">Simmons Hall</a> opened in that year.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization_and_administration">Organization and administration</span></h2>

<p>MIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Board_of_trustees" title="Board of trustees">board of trustees</a> known as the MIT Corporation. The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms, 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday, 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary), and 4 <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ex_officio" title="Ex officio">ex officio</a></i> members (the president of the alumni association, the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Massachusetts" title="Governor of Massachusetts">Governor of Massachusetts</a>, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court" title="Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a>). The board is chaired by <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Robert_Millard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert Millard (page does not exist)">Robert Millard</a>, a co-founder of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/L-3_Communications_Holdings" title="L-3 Communications Holdings">L-3 Communications Holdings</a>. The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty. MIT's <a href="/wiki/Financial_endowment" title="Financial endowment">endowment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pension" title="Pension">other financial assets</a> are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo). Valued at $13.475 billion in 2015, MIT's endowment is the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities.</p>
<p>MIT has five schools (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Science" title="MIT School of Science">Science</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Engineering" title="MIT School of Engineering">Engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Architecture_and_Planning" title="MIT School of Architecture and Planning">Architecture and Planning</a>, <a href="/wiki/MIT_Sloan_School_of_Management" title="MIT Sloan School of Management">Management</a>, and <a href="/wiki/MIT_School_of_Humanities,_Arts,_and_Social_Sciences" title="MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences">Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</a>) and one college (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Whitaker_College_of_Health_Sciences_and_Technology" title="Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology">Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology</a>), but no schools of law or medicine. While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs, the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President. The current president is <a href="/wiki/L._Rafael_Reif" title="L. Rafael Reif">L.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Academics">Academics</span></h2>
<p>MIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs. The university has been <a href="/wiki/Educational_accreditation" title="Educational accreditation">accredited</a> by the <a href="/wiki/New_England_Association_of_Schools_and_Colleges" title="New England Association of Schools and Colleges">New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> since 1929. MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_Day_(United_States)" title="Labor Day (United States)">Labor Day</a> and ending in mid-December, a 4-week "Independent Activities Period" in the month of January, and the spring semester beginning in early February and ending in late May.</p>
<p>MIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone. Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is <span class="nowrap">Course 1</span>, while Linguistics and Philosophy is <span class="nowrap">Course 24</span>. Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as "Course 6". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; the introductory calculus-based <a href="/wiki/Classical_mechanics" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a> course is simply "8.01" at MIT.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Undergraduate_program">Undergraduate program</span></h3>
<p>The four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences, and has been dubbed "most selective" by <i><a href="/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report" title="U.S. News &amp; World Report">U.S. News</a></i>, admitting few transfer students and 8.0% of its applicants in the 2015 admissions cycle. MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools. In the 2010–2011 academic year, 1,161 bachelor of science degrees (abbreviated "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scienti%C3%A6_Baccalaureus" title="Scientiæ Baccalaureus">SB</a>") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards. In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, &amp; Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%). The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (<span class="nowrap">Course 6–2</span>), Computer Science and Engineering (<span class="nowrap">Course 6–3</span>), Mechanical Engineering (<span class="nowrap">Course 2</span>), Physics (<span class="nowrap">Course 8</span>), and Mathematics (<span class="nowrap">Course 18</span>).</p>

<p>All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs). The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be "communication-intensive", including "substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation". Finally, all students are required to complete a <a href="/wiki/Human_swimming" title="Human swimming">swimming</a> test; non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of <a href="/wiki/Physical_education" title="Physical education">physical education</a> classes.</p>
<p>Most classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets ("p-sets"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to "drinking from a fire hose", the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities. The "pass/no-record" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded. (Grading had previously been "pass/no record" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from <a href="/wiki/Gaming_the_system" title="Gaming the system">gaming the system</a> by completing required major classes in their freshman year.) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as <a href="/wiki/Experimental_Study_Group" title="Experimental Study Group">Experimental Study Group</a>, <a href="/wiki/Concourse_Program_at_MIT" title="Concourse Program at MIT">Concourse</a>, or Terrascope.</p>
<p>In 1969, <a href="/wiki/Margaret_MacVicar" title="Margaret MacVicar">Margaret MacVicar</a> founded the <a href="/wiki/Undergraduate_Research_Opportunities_Program" title="Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects ("UROPs") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly. A substantial majority of undergraduates participate. Students often become <a href="/wiki/Scientific_journal" title="Scientific journal">published</a>, file <a href="/wiki/Patent_application" title="Patent application">patent applications</a>, and/or launch <a href="/wiki/Startup_company" title="Startup company">start-up companies</a> based upon their experience in UROPs.</p>
<p>In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hidden_Curriculum" title="The Hidden Curriculum">The Hidden Curriculum</a>,</i> arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled "<a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#Course_.22Bibles.22" title="History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology">course bibles</a>"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Graduate_program">Graduate program</span></h3>
<p>MIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/STEM_fields" title="STEM fields">STEM fields</a> as well as professional degrees. The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (MS), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (ScD) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MD-PhD" title="MD-PhD">MD-PhD</a> (with <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School" title="Harvard Medical School">Harvard Medical School</a>).</p>
<p>Admission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).</p>
<p>MIT awarded 1,547 master's degrees and 609 doctoral degrees in the academic year 2010–11. In the 2011 fall term, the School of Engineering was the most popular academic division, enrolling 45.0% of graduate students, followed by the Sloan School of Management (19%), School of Science (16.9%), School of Architecture and Planning (9.2%), Whitaker College of Health Sciences (5.1%), and School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (4.7%). The largest graduate degree programs were the Sloan <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MBA" title="MBA">MBA</a>, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering.</p>

In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="/wiki/Money_(magazine)" title="Money (magazine)"><i>Money</i> magazine</a> ranked MIT as third in the US "Best Colleges for Your Money", based on its assessment of "the most bang for your tuition buck", factoring in quality of education, affordability, and career outcomes.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Collaborations">Collaborations</span></h3>

<p>The university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government.  In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded <a href="/wiki/American_Research_and_Development_Corporation" title="American Research and Development Corporation">American Research and Development Corporation</a>, the first American <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Venture-capital" title="Venture-capital">venture-capital</a> firm.  In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Late_1980s_recession" title="Late 1980s recession">declining economy</a> by <a href="/wiki/Technology_transfer" title="Technology transfer">transferring</a> taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Japan" title="Economy of Japan">Japanese</a> – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as <a href="/wiki/President%27s_Science_Advisory_Committee" title="President's Science Advisory Committee">presidential scientific advisers</a> since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" title="Lobbying">lobbying</a> for research funding and national <a href="/wiki/Science_policy" title="Science policy">science policy</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="United States Department of Justice">U.S. Justice Department</a> began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">antitrust suit</a> against MIT, the eight <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Price-fixing" title="Price-fixing">price-fixing</a> during their annual "Overlap Meetings", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships. While the Ivy League institutions <a href="/wiki/Consent_decree" title="Consent decree">settled</a>, MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students. MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.</p>


<p>MIT's proximity to <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> ("the other school up the <a href="/wiki/Charles_River" title="Charles River">river</a>") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harvard-MIT_Division_of_Health_Sciences_and_Technology" title="Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology">Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Broad_Institute" title="Broad Institute">Broad Institute</a>.

<p>MIT enrolled 4,384 undergraduates and 6,510 graduate students in 2011–2012. Women constituted 45 percent of undergraduate students. Undergraduate and graduate students were drawn from all 50 states as well as 115 foreign countries.</p>
<p>MIT received 17,909 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2015; 1,742 were admitted (9.7 percent) and 1128 enrolled (64.8 percent). 19,446 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree program across all departments; 2,991 were admitted (15.4 percent) and 1,880 enrolled (62.8 percent).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Interquartile_range" title="Interquartile range">interquartile range</a> on the SAT was 2090–2340 and 97 percent of students ranked in the top tenth of their high school graduating class. 97 percent of the Class of 2012 returned as sophomores; 82 percent of the Class of 2007 graduated within 4 years, and 93 percent (91 percent of the men and 95 percent of the women) graduated within 6 years.</p>
<p>Undergraduate tuition and fees total $40,732 and annual expenses are estimated at $52,507 as of 2012. 62 percent of students received need-based financial aid in the form of scholarships and grants from federal, state, institutional, and external sources averaging $38,964 per student. Students were awarded a total of $102 million in scholarships and grants, primarily from institutional support ($84 million). The annual increase in expenses has led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek "tuition riots".</p>
<p>MIT has been nominally <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Co-education" title="Co-education">co-educational</a> since admitting <a href="/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards" title="Ellen Swallow Richards">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in <a href="/wiki/Environmental_health" title="Environmental health">sanitary chemistry</a>. Female students remained a minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Katherine_Dexter_McCormick" title="Katherine Dexter McCormick">McCormick Hall</a>, in 1963. Between 1993 and 2009, the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students. Women currently outnumber men in Biology, Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.</p>
<p>A number of student deaths in the late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in considerable media attention to MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the <a href="/wiki/Phi_Gamma_Delta" title="Phi Gamma Delta">Phi Gamma Delta</a> fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen to live in the dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Shin" title="Elizabeth Shin">Elizabeth Shin</a> drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student <a href="/wiki/Mental_health" title="Mental health">mental health</a> services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators <i><a href="/wiki/In_loco_parentis" title="In loco parentis">in loco parentis</a></i>.</p>

<p>As of 2013, MIT had 1,030 faculty members, of whom 225 were women. Faculty are responsible for lecturing classes, advising both graduate and undergraduate students, and sitting on academic committees, as well as conducting original research. Between 1964 and 2009, a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT were awarded Nobel Prizes (thirteen in the last 25 years). <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_laureates_by_university_affiliation" title="Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation">MIT faculty members</a> past or present have won a total of twenty-seven Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics. As of October 2013, among current faculty and teaching staff there are 67 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guggenheim_Fellow" title="Guggenheim Fellow">Guggenheim Fellows</a>, 6 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fulbright_Scholar" title="Fulbright Scholar">Fulbright Scholars</a>, and 22 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MacArthur_Fellow" title="MacArthur Fellow">MacArthur Fellows</a>. Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Institute_Professor" title="Institute Professor">Institute Professors</a> for the remainder of their tenures.</p>
<p>A 1998 MIT study concluded that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its School of Science, although the study's methods were controversial. Since the study, though, women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and of Engineering, and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents, although allegations of sexism continue to be made. <a href="/wiki/Susan_Hockfield" title="Susan Hockfield">Susan Hockfield</a>, a molecular <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neurobiology" title="Neurobiology">neurobiologist</a>, was MIT's president from 2004 to 2012 and was the first woman to hold the post.</p>
<p>Tenure outcomes have vaulted MIT into the national spotlight on several occasions. The 1984 dismissal of <a href="/wiki/David_F._Noble" title="David F. Noble">David F. Noble</a>, a historian of technology, became a <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cause_c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre" title="wikt:cause célèbre">cause célèbre</a></i> about the extent to which academics are granted <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a> after he published several books and papers critical of MIT's and other research universities' reliance upon financial support from corporations and the military. Former materials science professor Gretchen Kalonji sued MIT in 1994 alleging that she was denied tenure because of sexual discrimination. Several years later, the lawsuit was settled with undisclosed payments, and establishment of a project to encourage women and minorities to seek faculty positions. In 1997, the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Commission_Against_Discrimination" title="Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination">Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination</a> issued a probable cause finding supporting UMass Boston Professor James Jennings' allegations of racial discrimination after a senior faculty search committee in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning did not offer him reciprocal tenure. In 2006–2007, MIT's denial of tenure to African-American stem cell scientist professor <a href="/wiki/James_Sherley" title="James Sherley">James Sherley</a> reignited accusations of racism in the tenure process, eventually leading to a protracted public dispute with the administration, a brief <a href="/wiki/Hunger_strike" title="Hunger strike">hunger strike</a>, and the resignation of Professor <a href="/wiki/Frank_L._Douglas" title="Frank L. Douglas">Frank L. Douglas</a> in protest. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Boston_Globe" title="The Boston Globe">The Boston Globe</a></i> reported on February 6, 2007: "Less than half of MIT's junior faculty members are granted tenure. After Sherley was initially denied tenure, his case was examined three times before the university established that neither racial discrimination nor conflict of interest affected the decision. Twenty-one of Sherley's colleagues issued a statement yesterday saying that the professor was treated fairly in tenure review."</p>

<p>Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked #7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of 2013. Surveys cited a "smart", "creative", "friendly" environment, noting that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Work-life_balance" title="Work-life balance">work-life balance</a> tilts towards a "strong work ethic", but complaining about "low pay".</p>
