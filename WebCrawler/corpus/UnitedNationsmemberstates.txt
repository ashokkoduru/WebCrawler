<p>There are 193 <b>United Nations (UN) member states</b>, and each of them is a member of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>.</p>
<p><span id="Membership_terms"></span> The criteria for admission of new members are set out in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Charter" title="United Nations Charter">United Nations Charter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chapter_II_of_the_United_Nations_Charter" title="Chapter II of the United Nations Charter">Chapter II</a>, Article 4:</p>
<ol>
<li>Membership in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> is open to all peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgement of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.</li>
<li>The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">Security Council</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council's fifteen members, with none of the five <a href="/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" title="Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council">permanent members</a> <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power" title="United Nations Security Council veto power">voting against</a>. The Security Council's recommendation must then be subsequently approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote.</p>
<p>In principle, only <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">sovereign states</a> can become UN members, and currently all UN members are sovereign states. Although five members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, all subsequently became fully independent between 1946 and 1991. Because a state can only be admitted to the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly, <a href="/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition" title="List of states with limited recognition">a number of states that may be considered sovereign states</a> according to the <a href="/wiki/Montevideo_Convention" title="Montevideo Convention">Montevideo Convention</a> criteria are not members because the UN does not consider them to possess <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a>, mainly due to the lack of <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition" title="Diplomatic recognition">international recognition</a> or opposition from certain members.</p>
<p>In addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states (currently two: the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" title="Holy See">Holy See</a> and <a href="/wiki/State_of_Palestine" title="State of Palestine">Palestine</a>), <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization" title="Intergovernmental organization">intergovernmental organizations</a>, and other international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty are not precisely defined, to become <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers" title="United Nations General Assembly observers">observers at the General Assembly</a>, allowing them to participate and speak, but not vote, in General Assembly meetings.

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)" title="Republic of China (1912â€“1949)">Republic of China</a> (ROC) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Charter" title="United Nations Charter">United Nations Charter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chapter_V_of_the_United_Nations_Charter" title="Chapter V of the United Nations Charter">Chapter V</a>, Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>. In 1949, as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>-led ROC government lost effective control of <a href="/wiki/Mainland_China" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a> and relocated to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Island_of_Taiwan" title="Island of Taiwan">island of Taiwan</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" title="Communist Party of China">Communist Party</a>-led government of the <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">People's Republic of China</a> (PRC), declared on 1 October 1949, took control of mainland China. The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the <a href="/wiki/State_Council_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="State Council of the People's Republic of China">Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China</a>; however, the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_Republic_of_China" title="Government of the Republic of China">Government of the Republic of China</a> continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_islands_of_the_Republic_of_China" title="List of islands of the Republic of China">Taiwan and a number of smaller islands</a> compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members. Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the <a href="/wiki/One-China_policy" title="One-China policy">One-China policy</a>.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count. On 25 October 1971, the 21st time the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> debated on the PRC's admission into the UN, <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758">United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758</a> was adopted, by which it recognized that "the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council," and decided "to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek" title="Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN, including its permanent seat on the Security Council, from the ROC to the PRC, and expelled the ROC from the UN. From the United Nations' perspective the "Republic of China" is not a former member. No UN member was expelled in 1971. Rather, the credentials of one Chinese delegation (from Taipei) were rejected and the credentials of another Chinese delegation (from Beijing) were accepted.</p>
<p>In addition to losing its seat in the UN, the UN Secretary-General concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China. Consequently, the Secretary-General decided that it was not permitted for the ROC to become a party to treaties deposited with it.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bids_for_readmission_as_the_representative_of_Taiwan">Bids for readmission as the representative of Taiwan</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan" title="Political status of Taiwan">Political status of Taiwan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Four-Stage_Theory_of_the_Republic_of_China" title="Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China">Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China</a></div>

<p>In 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the People's Republic of China. A number of options were considered, including seeking membership in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specialized_agencies" title="Specialized agencies">specialized agencies</a>, applying for <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers" title="United Nations General Assembly observers">observer status</a>, applying for full membership, or having resolution 2758 revoked to reclaim the seat of China in the UN.</p>
<p>Every year from 1993-2006, UN member states submitted a memorandum to the UN Secretary-General requesting that the UN General Assembly consider allowing the ROC to resume participating in the United Nations. This approach was chosen, rather than a formal application for membership, because it could be enacted by the General Assembly, while a membership application would need Security Council approval, where the PRC held a veto. Early proposals recommended admitting the ROC with parallel representation over China, along with the People's Republic of China, pending eventual reunification, citing examples of other divided countries which had become separate UN member states, such as <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. Later proposals emphasized that the ROC was a separate state, over which the PROC had no effective sovereignty. These proposed resolutions referred to the ROC under a variety of names: "Republic of China in Taiwan" (1993â€“94), "Republic of China on Taiwan" (1995â€“97, 1999-2002), "Republic of China" (1998), "Republic of China (Taiwan)" (2003) and "Taiwan" (2004-06).</p>
<p>However, all fourteen attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assembly's General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assembly's agenda for debate, under strong opposition from the PRC.</p>
<p>While all these proposals were vague, requesting the ROC be allowed to participate in UN activities without specifying any legal mechanism, in 2007 the ROC submitted a formal application under the name "Taiwan" for full membership in the UN. However, the application was rejected by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Office_of_Legal_Affairs" title="United Nations Office of Legal Affairs">United Nations Office of Legal Affairs</a> citing General Assembly Resolution 2758, without being forwarded to the Security Council. <a href="/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="Secretary-General of the United Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> <a href="/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> stated that:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The position of the United Nations is that the People's Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China. The decision until now about the wish of the people in Taiwan to join the United Nations has been decided on that basis. The resolution (General Assembly Resolution 2758) that you just mentioned is clearly mentioning that the Government of China is the sole and legitimate Government and the position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responding to the UN's rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan's participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation. The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly, contrary to UN's standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59). On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN's decision "was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the <a href="/wiki/One-China_policy" title="One-China policy">one-China principle</a>". A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that fall's UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application.</p>
<p>The following year <a href="/wiki/Taiwanese_United_Nations_membership_referendums,_2008" title="Taiwanese United Nations membership referendums, 2008">two referendums</a> in Taiwan on the government's attempts to regain participation at the UN did not pass due to low turnout. That fall the ROC took a new approach, with its allies submitting a resolution requesting that the "Republic of China (Taiwan)" be allowed to have "meaningful participation" in the UN <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specialized_agencies" title="Specialized agencies">specialized agencies</a>. Again the issue was not put on the Assembly's agenda. In 2009, the ROC chose not to bring the issue of its participation in the UN up for debate at the General Assembly for the first time since it began the campaign in 1993.</p>
<p>In May 2009, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Republic_of_China)" title="Department of Health (Republic of China)">Department of Health of the Republic of China</a> was invited by the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> to attend the 62nd <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Assembly" title="World Health Assembly">World Health Assembly</a> as an observer under the name "<a href="/wiki/Chinese_Taipei" title="Chinese Taipei">Chinese Taipei</a>". This was the ROC's first participation in an event organized by a <a href="/wiki/List_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_United_Nations" title="List of specialized agencies of the United Nations">UN-affiliated agency</a> since 1971, as a result of the improved <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cross-strait_relations" title="Cross-strait relations">cross-strait relations</a> since <a href="/wiki/Ma_Ying-jeou" title="Ma Ying-jeou">Ma Ying-jeou</a> became the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_China" title="President of the Republic of China">President of the Republic of China</a> a year before.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, with its name changed to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 20 April 1990.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>, referred to as Yugoslavia, joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945. By 1992, it had been effectively <a href="/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia" title="Breakup of Yugoslavia">dissolved</a> into five independent states, which were all subsequently admitted to the UN:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> were admitted to the UN on 22 May 1992.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Macedonia</a> was admitted to the UN on 8 April 1993, being provisionally referred to for all purposes within the UN as "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" pending settlement of the <a href="/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute" title="Macedonia naming dispute">difference that had arisen over its name</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> (name later changed to Serbia and Montenegro) was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the dispute over its legal <a href="/wiki/Succession_of_states" title="Succession of states">successor states</a>, the member state "Yugoslavia", referring to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, remained on the official roster of UN members for many years after its effective dissolution. Following the admission of all five states as new UN members, "Yugoslavia" was removed from the official roster of UN members.</p>

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to comply with the resolution for many years, but following the ousting of <a href="/wiki/President_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro" title="President of Serbia and Montenegro">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87" title="Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡">Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡</a> from office, it applied for membership, and was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000. On 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had its official name changed to Serbia and Montenegro, following the adoption and promulgation of the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Charter_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro" title="Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro">Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro</a> by the Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>On the basis of a <a href="/wiki/Montenegrin_independence_referendum,_2006" title="Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006">referendum</a> held on 21 May 2006, <a href="/wiki/Montenegro" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> declared independence from <a href="/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Serbia and Montenegro</a> on 3 June 2006.

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>A Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since its inception, no member state has been suspended or expelled from the UN under Articles 5 and 6. However, in a few cases, states were suspended or expelled from participating in UN activities by means other than Articles 5 and 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On 25 October 1971, <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758">United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758</a> was adopted, which recognized the <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">People's Republic of China</a> instead of the <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Republic of China</a> (since 1949 controlling only Taiwan) as the legitimate representative of China in the UN and effectively expelled the Republic of China from the UN in 1971 <i>(see the section <a href="#Republic_of_China">Former members: Republic of China</a>)</i>. This act did not constitute as the expulsion of a member state under Article 6, as this would have required Security Council approval and been subjected to <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power" title="United Nations Security Council veto power">vetoes</a> by its permanent members, which included the Republic of China itself and the United States, which at that time still recognized the Republic of China.</li>
<li>In October 1974, the Security Council considered a draft resolution that would have recommended that the General Assembly immediately expel South Africa from the UN, in compliance with Article 6 of the United Nations Charter, due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa" title="Apartheid in South Africa">its apartheid policies</a>. However, the resolution was not adopted because of vetoes by three permanent members of the Security Council: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In response, the General Assembly decided to suspend South Africa from participation in the work of the Assembly's 29th session on 12 November 1974; however, South Africa was not formally suspended under Article 5. The suspension lasted until the General Assembly welcomed South Africa back to full participation in the UN on 23 June 1994, following its successful democratic <a href="/wiki/South_African_general_election,_1994" title="South African general election, 1994">elections earlier that year</a>.</li>
<li>On 28 April 1992, the new <a href="/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> was established, by the remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro of the former <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. On 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, by which it considered that "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations," and therefore decided that "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly". It did not apply for membership until <a href="/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87" title="Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡">Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡</a> was ousted from the presidency and was admitted on 1 November 2000 <i>(see the section <a href="#Yugoslavia">Former members: Yugoslavia</a>)</i>.</li>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/CONEFO" title="CONEFO">CONEFO</a></div>

<p>Since the inception of the UN, only one member state (excluding those that dissolved or merged with other member states) has unilaterally withdrawn from the UN. During the <a href="/wiki/Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia_confrontation" title="Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia confrontation">Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia confrontation</a>, and in response to the election of <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> as a <a href="/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" title="List of members of the United Nations Security Council">non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council</a>, in a letter dated 20 January 1965, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> informed the <a href="/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="Secretary-General of the United Nations">United Nations Secretary-General</a> that it had decided "at this stage and under the present circumstances" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of <a href="/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" title="President of Indonesia">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Sukarno" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision "to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly". On 28 September 1966, the United Nations General Assembly took note of the decision of the Government of Indonesia and the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="President of the United Nations General Assembly">President</a> invited the representatives of that country to take their seats in the Assembly.</p>
<p>Unlike suspension and expulsion, no express provision is made in the United Nations Charter of whether or how a member can legally withdraw from the UN (largely to prevent the threat of withdrawal from being used as a form of political blackmail, or to evade obligations under the Charter, similar to withdrawals that weakened the UN's predecessor, the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>), or on whether a request for readmission by a withdrawn member should be treated the same as an application for membership, i.e., requiring Security Council as well as General Assembly approval. Indonesia's return to the UN would suggest that this is not required; however, scholars have argued that the course of action taken by the General Assembly was not in accordance with the Charter from a legal point of view.</p>

<li>The <a href="/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> was granted observer status as a ""non-member entity"" on 22 November 1974. Acknowledging the proclamation of the <a href="/wiki/State_of_Palestine" title="State of Palestine">State of Palestine</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_National_Council" title="Palestinian National Council">Palestine National Council</a> on 15 November 1988, the United Nations General Assembly decided that, effective as of 15 December 1988, the designation "Palestine" should be used in place of the designation "Palestine Liberation Organization" in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_System" title="United Nations System">United Nations System</a>.

The State of Palestine was recognized as a "non-member state" on 29 November 2012, when the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> passed <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution_67/19" title="United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19">United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19</a> by a vote of 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions.
