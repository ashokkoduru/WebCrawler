<p><b>Organic certification</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Product_certification" title="Product certification">certification</a> process for producers of <a href="/wiki/Organic_food" title="Organic food">organic food</a> and other organic <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> products. In general, any <a href="/wiki/Business" title="Business">business</a> directly involved in food production can be certified, including <a href="/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seed</a> suppliers, <a href="/wiki/Farmer" title="Farmer">farmers</a>, food processors, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Retailer" title="Retailer">retailers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Restaurant" title="Restaurant">restaurants</a>.</p>
<p>Requirements vary from <a href="/wiki/Country" title="Country">country</a> to country (<a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_with_organic_agriculture_regulation" title="List of countries with organic agriculture regulation">List of countries with organic agriculture regulation</a>), and generally involve a set of production standards for growing, storage, processing, packaging and shipping that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoidance of <a href="/wiki/Chemical_synthesis" title="Chemical synthesis">synthetic</a> chemical inputs (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antibiotic" title="Antibiotic">antibiotics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Food_additive" title="Food additive">food additives</a>), <a href="/wiki/Irradiation" title="Irradiation">irradiation</a>, and the use of <a href="/wiki/Sewage_sludge" title="Sewage sludge">sewage sludge</a>;</li>
<li>avoidance of <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_crops" title="Genetically modified crops">genetically modified seed</a>;</li>
<li>use of farmland that has been free from prohibited chemical inputs for a number of years (often, three or more);</li>
<li>for livestock, adhering to specific requirements for feed, housing, and breeding;</li>
<li>keeping detailed written production and sales records (audit trail);</li>
<li>maintaining strict physical separation of organic products from non-certified products;</li>
<li>undergoing periodic on-site inspections.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some countries, certification is overseen by the <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a>, and commercial use of the term <i>organic</i> is legally restricted. Certified organic producers are also subject to the same agricultural, food safety and other government <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulations</a> that apply to non-certified producers.</p>
<p>Certified organic foods are not necessarily pesticide-free, certain pesticides are allowed.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose">Purpose</span></h2>
<p>Organic certification addresses a growing worldwide demand for organic food. It is intended to assure quality and prevent <a href="/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, and to promote commerce. While such certification was not necessary in the early days of the <a href="/wiki/Organic_movement" title="Organic movement">organic movement</a>, when small farmers would sell their produce directly at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Farmers%27_markets" title="Farmers' markets">farmers' markets</a>, as organics have grown in popularity, more and more consumers are purchasing organic food through traditional channels, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supermarkets" title="Supermarkets">supermarkets</a>. As such, consumers must rely on third-party regulatory certification.</p>
<p>For organic producers, certification identifies suppliers of products approved for use in certified operations. For consumers, "certified organic" serves as a product assurance, similar to "low fat", "100% whole wheat", or "no artificial preservatives".</p>
<p>Certification is essentially aimed at regulating and facilitating the sale of organic products to consumers. Individual certification bodies have their own <a href="/wiki/Service_mark" title="Service mark">service marks</a>, which can act as branding to consumers—a certifier may promote the high <a href="/wiki/Consumer" title="Consumer">consumer</a> recognition value of its <a href="/wiki/Logo" title="Logo">logo</a> as a marketing advantage to producers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Methods">Methods</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Third-party">Third-party</span></h3>
<p>To certify a <a href="/wiki/Farm" title="Farm">farm</a>, the farmer is typically required to engage in a number of new activities, in addition to normal farming operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Study</b> the organic standards, which cover in specific detail what is and is not allowed for every aspect of farming, including storage, <a href="/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">transport</a> and sale.</li>
<li><b>Compliance</b> — farm facilities and production methods must comply with the standards, which may involve modifying facilities, sourcing and changing suppliers, etc.</li>
<li><b>Documentation</b> — extensive paperwork is required, detailing farm history and current set-up, and usually including results of soil and water tests.</li>
<li><b>Planning</b> — a written annual production plan must be submitted, detailing everything from seed to sale: seed sources, field and crop locations, fertilization and pest control activities, harvest methods, storage locations, etc.</li>
<li><b>Inspection</b> — annual on-farm inspections are required, with a physical tour, examination of records, and an oral interview.</li>
<li><b>Fee</b> — an annual inspection/certification fee (currently starting at $400–$2,000/year, in the US and Canada, depending on the agency and the size of the operation). There are financial assistance programs for qualifying certified operations.</li>
<li><b>Record-keeping</b> — written, day-to-day farming and marketing records, covering all activities, must be available for inspection at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, short-notice or surprise inspections can be made, and specific tests (e.g. soil, water, plant tissue) may be requested.</p>
<p>For first-time farm certification, the soil must meet basic requirements of being free from use of prohibited substances (synthetic chemicals, etc.) for a number of years. A conventional farm must adhere to organic standards for this period, often two to three years. This is known as being in <i>transition</i>. Transitional crops are not considered fully organic.</p>
<p>Certification for operations other than farms follows a similar process. The focus is on the quality of ingredients and other inputs, and processing and handling conditions. A transport company would be required to detail the use and maintenance of its vehicles, storage facilities, containers, and so forth. A restaurant would have its premises inspected and its suppliers verified as certified organic.</p>

<p>Participatory Guarantee Systems are also referred to as "participatory certification".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_certification_options">Alternative certification options</span></h3>
<p>The word <i>organic</i> is central to the certification (and organic food marketing) process, and this is also questioned by some. Where organic laws exist, producers cannot use the term legally without certification. To bypass this legal requirement for certification, various alternative certification approaches, using currently undefined terms like "authentic" and "natural", are emerging. In the US, motivated by the cost and legal requirements of certification (as of Oct. 2002), the private farmer-to-farmer association, <a href="/wiki/Certified_Naturally_Grown" title="Certified Naturally Grown">Certified Naturally Grown</a>, offers a "non-profit alternative eco-labelling program for small farms that grow using USDA Organic methods but are not a part of the USDA Certified Organic program."</p>
<p>In the UK, the interests of smaller-scale growers who use "natural" growing methods are represented by the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Wholesome_Food_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Wholesome Food Association (page does not exist)">Wholesome Food Association</a>, which issues a symbol based largely on trust and peer-to-peer inspection.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organic_certification_and_the_Millennium_Development_Goals_.28MDGs.29">Organic certification and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</span></h2>
<p>Organic certification, as well as <a href="/wiki/Fair_trade_certification" title="Fair trade certification">fair trade certification</a>, has the potential to directly and indirectly contribute to the achievement of some of the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs), which are the eight international development goals that were established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, with all United Nations member states committed to help achieve the MDGs by 2015. With the growth of ethical consumerism in developed countries, imports of eco-friendly and socially certified produce from the poor in developing countries have increased, which could contribute towards the achievement of the MDGs. A study by Setboonsarng (2008) reveals that organic certification substantially contributes to MDG1 (poverty and hunger) and MDG7 (environmental sustainability) by way of premium prices and better market access, among others. This study concludes that for this market-based development scheme to broaden its poverty impacts, public sector support in harmonizing standards, building up the capacity of certifiers, developing infrastructure development, and innovating alternative certification systems will be required.</p>

<p>In some countries, organic standards are formulated and overseen by the <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, Canada and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> have comprehensive organic legislation, and the term "organic" may be used only by certified producers. Being able to put the word "organic" on a food product is a valuable marketing advantage in today's consumer market, but does not guarantee the product is legitimately organic. Certification is intended to protect consumers from misuse of the term, and make buying organics easy. However, the organic labeling made possible by certification itself usually requires explanation. In countries without organic laws, government guidelines may or may not exist, while certification is handled by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-profit" title="Non-profit">non-profit</a> organizations and private <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Company_(law)" title="Company (law)">companies</a>.</p>

Where formal agreements do not exist between countries, organic product for export is often certified by agencies from the importing countries, who may establish permanent foreign offices for this purpose. In 2011 IFOAM introduced a new program - the IFOAM Family of Standards - that attempts to simplify harmonization. The vision is to establish the use of one single global reference (the COROS) to access the quality of standards rather than focusing on bilateral agreements.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, “organic” is a labeling term for food or agricultural products (“food, feed or fiber”) that have been produced according to USDA organic regulations, which define standards that “integrate cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.” USDA standards recognize four types of organic production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crops: “Plants that are grown to be harvested as food, livestock feed, or fiber used to add nutrients to the field.”</li>
<li>Livestock: “Animals that can be used in the production of food, fiber, or feed.”</li>
<li>Processed/multi-ingredient products: “Items that have been handled and packaged (e.g. chopped carrots) or combined, processed, and packaged (e.g. bread or soup).”</li>
<li>Wild crops: “Plants from a growing site that is not cultivated.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Organic agricultural operations should ultimately maintain or improve soil and water quality, and conserve wetlands, woodlands, and wildlife.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the <a href="/wiki/Organic_Foods_Production_Act_of_1990" title="Organic Foods Production Act of 1990">Organic Foods Production Act of 1990</a> "requires the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture" title="United States Secretary of Agriculture">Secretary of Agriculture</a> to establish a National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances which identifies synthetic substances that may be used, and the nonsynthetic substances that cannot be used, in organic production and handling operations."</p>
<p>Also in the U.S., the Secretary of Agriculture promulgated regulations establishing the <a href="/wiki/National_Organic_Program" title="National Organic Program">National Organic Program</a> (NOP). The final rule was published in the Federal Register in 2000.</p>
<p>USDA Organic certification confirms that the farm or handling facility (whether within the United States or internationally) complies with USDA organic regulations. Farms or handling facilities can be certified by private, foreign, or State entities, whose agents are accredited by the USDA (accredited agents are listed on the <a class="external text" href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/NOPACAs" rel="nofollow">USDA website</a>). Any farm or business that grosses more than $5,000 annually in organic sales must be certified. Farms and businesses that make less than $5,000 annually are “exempt,” and must follow all the requirements as stated in the USDA regulations except for two requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exempt operations do not need to be certified to “sell, label, or represent” their products as organic, but may not use the USDA organic seal or label their products as “certified organic.” Exempt operations may pursue optional certification if they wish to use the USDA organic seal.</li>
<li>Exempt operations are not required to have a system plan that documents the specific practices and substances used in the production or handling of their organic products</li>
</ul>
<p>Exempt operations are also barred from selling their products as ingredients for use in another producer or handler’s certified organic product, and may be required by buyers to sign an affidavit affirming adherence to USDA organic regulations.</p>
<p>Before an operation may sell, label or represent their products as “organic” (or use the USDA organic seal), it must undergo a 3-year transition period where any land used to produce raw organic commodities must be left untreated with prohibited substances.</p>
<p>Operations seeking certification must first submit an application for organic certification to a USDA-accredited certifying agent including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A detailed description of the operation seeking certification</li>
<li>A history of substances used on the land over the prior 3 years</li>
<li>A list of the organic products grown, raised, or processed</li>
<li>A written “Organic System Plan (OSP)” which outlines the practices and substances intended for use during future organic production.</li>
<li>Processors/handlers who are not primarily a farm (and farms with livestock and/or crops that also process products) must complete an Organic Handling Plan (OHP), and also include a product profile and label for each product</li>
</ul>
<p>Certifying agents then review the application to confirm that the operation’s practices follow USDA regulations, and schedule an inspection to verify adherence to the OSP, maintenance of records, and overall regulatory compliance</p>
<p><b>Inspection</b> The during the site visit, the inspector observes onsite practices and compares them to the OSP, looks for any potential contamination by prohibited materials (or any risk of potential contamination), and takes soil, tissue, or product samples as needed. At farming operations, the inspector will also examine the fields, water systems, storage areas, and equipment, assess pest and weed management, check feed production, purchase records, livestock and their living conditions, and records of animal health management practices. For processing and handling facilities, the inspector evaluates the receiving, processing, and storage areas for organic ingredients and finished products, as well as assessing any potential hazards or contamination points (from “sanitation systems, pest management materials, or nonorganic processing aids”). If the facility also processes or handles nonorganic materials, the inspector will also analyze the measures in place to prevent comingling.</p>
<p>If the written application and operational inspection are successful, the certifying agent will issue an organic certificate to the applicant. The producer or handler must then submit an updated application and OSP, pay recertification fees to the agent, and undergo annual onsite inspections to receive recertification annually. Once certified, producers and handlers can have up to 75% of their organic certification costs reimbursed through the <a class="external text" href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/organicinfo" rel="nofollow">USDA Organic Certification Cost-Share Programs</a>.</p>
<p>Federal legislation defines three levels of organic foods. Products made entirely with certified organic ingredients, methods, and processing aids can be labeled "100% organic" (including raw agricultural commodities that have been certified), while only products with at least 95% organic ingredients may be labeled "organic" (any non-organic ingredients used must fall under the exemptions of the National List). Under these two categories, no nonorganic agricultural ingredients are allowed when organic ingredients are available. Both of these categories may also display the "USDA Organic" seal, and must state the name of the certifying agent on the information panel.</p>
<p>A third category, containing a minimum of 70% organic ingredients, can be labeled "made with organic ingredients," but may not display the USDA Organic seal. Any remaining agricultural ingredients must be produced without excluded methods, including genetic modification[14], irradiation, or the application of synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, or biosolids. Non-agricultural ingredients used must be allowed on the National List. Organic ingredients must be marked in the ingredients list (e.g., "organic dill" or with an asterisk denoting organic status). In addition, products may also display the logo of the certification body that approved them.</p>
<p>Products made with less than 70% organic ingredients can not be advertised as "organic," but can list individual ingredients that are organic as such in the product's ingredient statement. Also, USDA ingredients from plants cannot be <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_food" title="Genetically modified food">genetically modified</a>.</p>
<p>Livestock feed is only eligible for labeling as “100% Organic” or “Organic."</p>
<p>Alcoholic products are also subject to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations. Any use of added sulfites in wine made with organic grapes means that the product is only eligible for the “made with” labeling category and therefore may not use the USDA organic seal. Wine labeled as made with other organic fruit cannot have sulfites added to it.</p>
<p>Organic textiles made be labeled organic and use the USDA organic seal if the finished product is certified organic and produced in full compliance with USDA organic regulations. If all of a specific fiber used in a product is certified organic, the label may state the percentage of organic fibers and identify the organic material.</p>
<p>Organic certification mandates that the certifying inspector must be able to complete both “trace-back” and “mass balance audits” for all ingredients and products. A trace-back audit confirms the existence of a record trail from time of purchase/production through the final sale. A mass balance audit verifies that enough organic product and ingredients have been produced or purchased to match the amount of product sold. Each ingredient and product must have an assigned lot number to ensure the existence of a proper audit trail.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest organizations to carry out organic certification in North America were the <a href="/wiki/California_Certified_Organic_Farmers" title="California Certified Organic Farmers">California Certified Organic Farmers</a>, founded in 1973, and the voluntary standards and certification program popularized by the Rodale Press in 1972. Some retailers have their stores certified as organic handlers and processors to ensure organic compliance is maintained throughout the supply chain until delivered to consumers, such as <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_Cottage_Natural_Grocers" title="Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers">Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers</a>, a 60-year-old chain based in Colorado.</p>
<p>Violations of USDA Organic regulations carry fines up to $11,000 per violation, and can also lead to suspension or revocation of a farm or business’s organic certificate.</p>
<p>Once certified, USDA organic products can be exported to countries currently engaged in <a class="external text" href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/NOPInternationalAgreements" rel="nofollow">organic trade agreements</a> with the U.S., including Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan, and do not require additional certification as long as the terms of the agreement are met.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, certification was implemented at the federal level on June 30, 2009. Mandatory certification is required for agricultural products represented as organic in import, export and inter-provincial trade, or that bear the federal organic logo. In <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="/wiki/Province" title="Province">provincial</a> legislation provides government oversight of organic certification within the province, through the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Quebec_Accreditation_Board&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Quebec Accreditation Board (page does not exist)">Quebec Accreditation Board</a> (<i>Conseil D'Accréditation Du Québec</i>).</p>

<p>EU countries acquired comprehensive organic legislation with the implementation of the <a href="/wiki/EU-Eco-regulation" title="EU-Eco-regulation">EU-Eco-regulation</a> 1992. Supervision of certification bodies is handled on the national level. In March 2002 the European Commission issued a <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a>-wide label for organic food. It has been mandatory throughout the EU since July 2010. and has become compulsory after a two-year transition period.</p>
<p>In 2009 a new logo was chosen through a design competition and online public vote. The new logo is a green rectangle that shows twelve stars (from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_flag" title="European flag">European flag</a>) placed such that they form the shape of a leaf in the wind. Unlike earlier labels no words are presented on the label lifting the requirement for translations referring to organic food certification.</p>
<p>The new EU organic label has been implemented since July 2010 and has replaced the old European Organic label. However, producers that have had already printed and ready to use packaging with the old label were allowed to use them in the upcoming 2 years.</p>
<p>The development of the EU organic label was develop based on Denmark's organic food policy and the rules behind the Danish organic food label which at the moment holds the highest rate of recognition among its users in the world respectively 98% and 90% trust the label. The current EU organic label is meant to signal to the consumer that at least 95% of the ingredients used in the processed organic food is from organic origin and 5% considered an acceptable error margin.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, organic certification was introduced in 1985. It has established a green-white logo of "AB - agriculture biologique." The certification for the AB label fulfills the EU regulations for organic food. The certification process is overseen a public institute ("Agence française pour le développement et la promotion de l'agriculture biologique" usually shortended to "Agence bio") established in November 2001. The actual certification authorities include a number of different institutes like Aclave, Agrocert, Ecocert SA, Qualité France SA, Ulase, SGS ICS.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Germany">Germany</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> the national label was introduced in September 2001 following in the footsteps of the political campaign of "Agrarwende" (<i>agricultural major shift</i>) led by minister <a href="/wiki/Renate_K%C3%BCnast" title="Renate Künast">Renate Künast</a> of the Greens party. This campaign was started after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mad-cow_disease" title="Mad-cow disease">mad-cow disease</a> epidemic in 2000. The effects on farming are still challenged by other political parties. The national "Bio"-label in its hexagon green-black-white shape has gained wide popularity - in 2007 there were 2431 companies having certified 41708 products. The popularity of the label is extending to neighbouring countries like Austria, Switzerland and France.</p>
<p>In the German-speaking countries there have been older non-government organizations that had issued labels for organic food long before the advent of the EU organic food regulations. Their labels are still used widely as they significantly exceed the requirements of the EU regulations. An organic food label like "demeter" from <a href="/wiki/Demeter_International" title="Demeter International">Demeter International</a> has been in use since 1928 and this label is still regarded as providing the highest standards for organic food in the world.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Switzerland">Switzerland</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, products sold as organic must comply at a minimum with the Swiss organic regulation (Regulation 910.18). Higher standards are required before a product can be labelled with the <a href="/wiki/Bio_Suisse" title="Bio Suisse">Bio Suisse</a> label.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sweden">Sweden</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, organic certification is handled by the organisation <a href="/wiki/KRAV_(agriculture)" title="KRAV (agriculture)">KRAV (agriculture)</a> with members such as farmers, processors, trade and also consumer, environmental and animal welfare interests.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</span></h4>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, organic certification is handled by a number of organizations, regulated by <a class="external text" href="https://gov.uk/defra" rel="nofollow">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</a>, of which the largest are the <a href="/wiki/Soil_Association" title="Soil Association">Soil Association</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Organic_Farmers_and_Growers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Organic Farmers and Growers (page does not exist)">Organic Farmers and Growers</a>. UK certification bodies are required to meet the EU minimum organic standards for all member states; they may choose to certify to standards that exceed the minimums, as is the case with the Soil Association.</p>
<p>The farmland converted to produce certified organic food has seen a significant evolution in the EU15 countries, rising from 1.8% in 1998 to 4.1% in 2005. For the current EU25 countries however the statistics report an overall percentage of just 1.5% as of 2005. However the statistics showed a larger <a href="/wiki/Inventory" title="Inventory">turnover</a> of organic food in some countries, reaching 10% in France and 14% in Germany. In France 21% of available vegetables, fruits, milk and eggs were certified as organic. Numbers for 2010 show that 5.4% of German farmland has been converted to produce certified organic food, as has 10.4% of Swiss farmland and 11.7% of Austrian farmland. Non-EU countries have widely adopted the European certification regulations for organic food, to increase export to EU countries.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Australia">Australia</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, organic certification is performed by several organisations that are accredited by the Biosecurity section of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture_(Australia)" title="Department of Agriculture (Australia)">Department of Agriculture (Australia)</a>, formerly the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Quarantine_and_Inspection_Service" title="Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service">Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service</a>, under the National Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Produce. All claims about the organic status of products sold in Australia are covered under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.</p>
<p>In Australia, the The Organic Federation of Australia is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peak_body" title="Peak body">peak body</a> for the organic industry in Australia and is part of the government's Organic Consultative Committee Legislative Working Group that sets organic standards.</p>
<p>Department of Agriculture accreditation is a legal requirement for all organic products exported from Australia. Export Control (Organic Produce Certification) Orders are used by the Department to assess organic certifying bodies and recognise them as <a href="/wiki/Organic_certification#Australian_approved_certifying_organisations" title="Organic certification">approved certifying organisations</a>. Approved certifying organisations are assessed by the Department for both initial recognition and on an at least annual basis thereafter to verify compliance.</p>
<p>In the absence of domestic regulation, DOA accreditation also serves as a 'de facto' benchmark for certified product sold on the domestic market. Despite its size and growing share of the economy "the organic industry in Australia remains largely self‐governed. There is no specific legislation for domestic organic food standardisation and labelling at the state or federal level as there is in the USA and the EU".</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Australian_approved_certifying_organisations">Australian approved certifying organisations</span></h5>
<p>The Department has several approved certifying organisations that manage the certification process of organic and bio-dynamic operators in Australia. These certifying organisations perform a number of functions on the Department's behalf:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess organic and bio-dynamic operators to determine compliance to the National Standard for Organic and Bio-Dynamic Produce and importing country requirements.</li>
<li>Issue a Quality Management Certificate (QM Certificate) to organic operators to recognise compliance to export requirements.</li>
<li>Issue Organic Produce Certificates (Export Documentation) for consignments of organic and bio-dynamic produce being exported.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2015, there are seven approved certifying organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>AUS-QUAL Pty Ltd (AUSQUAL)</li>
<li>Australian Certified Organic (ACO)</li>
<li>Bio-Dynamic Research Institute (BDRI)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/National_Association_for_Sustainable_Agriculture_Australia" title="National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia">NASAA</a> Certified Organic (NCO)</li>
<li>Organic Food Chain (OFC)</li>
<li>Safe Food Production Queensland (SFQ)</li>
<li>Tasmanian Organic-dynamic Producers (TOP)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 2567 certified organic businesses reported in Australia in 2014. They include 1707 primary producers, 719 processors and manufacturers, 141 wholesalers and retailers plus other operators.</p>
<p>Australia does not have a logo or seal to identify which products are certified organic, instead the logos of the individual certifying organisations are used.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="China">China</span></h4>
<p>In China, the organic certification are administrate by government agency named Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People’s Republic of China (CNCA). While the implementation of certification works, including site checking, lab test on soil, water, product qualities are perform by China Quality Certification Center (CQC) which is an agency of Administration of Quality Supervision,Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ). Organic certification procedure in china are perform according to China Organic Standard GB19630.1-4—2005 which issued on year 2005. This standard had governed standard procedure for Organic certification process perform by CQC, including application, inspection, lab test procedures, certification decision, post certification administration each. The certificate issue by CQC are valid for 1 year.</p>
<p>There are 2 logo are currently apply by CQC for Organic Certification, including Organic Logo and Conversion to Organic Logo.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="India">India</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, APEDA regulates the certification of organic products as per National Standards for Organic Production. "The NPOP standards for production and accreditation system have been recognized by European Commission and Switzerland as equivalent to their country standards. Similarly, USDA has recognized NPOP conformity assessment procedures of accreditation as equivalent to that of US. With these recognitions, Indian organic products duly certified by the accredited certification bodies of India are accepted by the importing countries." Organic food products manufactured and exported from India are marked with the <a href="/wiki/India_Organic" title="India Organic">India Organic</a> certification mark issued by the APEDA. APEDA has recognized 11 inspection certification bodies, some of which are branches of foreign certification bodies, others are local certification bodies.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Japan">Japan</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Agricultural_Standard" title="Japanese Agricultural Standard">Japanese Agricultural Standard</a> (JAS) was fully implemented as law in April 2001. This was revised in November 2005 and all JAS certifiers were required to be re-accredited by the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Singapore">Singapore</span></h4>
<p>As of 2014 the The Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) had no organic certification process, but instead relied on international certification bodies; it does not track local producers who claim to have gotten organic certification.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Issues">Issues</span></h2>
<p>Organic certification is not without its critics. Some of the staunchest opponents of chemical-based farming and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Factory_farming" title="Factory farming">factory farming</a> practices also oppose formal certification. They see it as a way to drive independent organic farmers out of business, and to undermine the quality of organic food. Other organizations such as the <a href="/wiki/Organic_Trade_Association" title="Organic Trade Association">Organic Trade Association</a> work within the organic community to foster awareness of legislative and other related issues, and enable the influence and participation of organic proponents.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obstacles_to_small_independent_producers">Obstacles to small independent producers</span></h3>
<p>Originally, in the 1960s through the 1980s, the organic food <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a> was composed of mainly small, independent farmers, selling locally. Organic "certification" was a matter of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trust_(sociology)" title="Trust (sociology)">trust</a>, based on a direct relationship between farmer and consumer. Critics view regulatory certification as a potential <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barrier_to_entry" title="Barrier to entry">barrier to entry</a> for small producers, by burdening them with increased costs, paperwork, and <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a></p>
<p>In China, due to government regulations, international companies wishing to market organic produce must be independently certified. It is reported that "Australian food producers are spending up to $50,000 to be certified organic by Chinese authorities to crack the burgeoning middle-class market of the Asian superpower." Whilst the certification process is described by producers "extremely difficult and very expensive", a number of organic producers have acknowledged the ultimately positive effect of gaining access to the emerging Chinese market. For example, figures from Australian organic infant formula and baby food producer <a href="/wiki/Bellamy%27s_Organic" title="Bellamy's Organic">Bellamy's Organic</a> indicate export growth, to China alone, of 70 per cent per year since gaining Chinese certification in 2008, while similar producers have shown export growth of 20 per cent to 30 per cent a year following certification</p>
<p>Peak Australian organic certification body, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Australian_Certified_Organic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Australian Certified Organic (page does not exist)">Australian Certified Organic</a>, has stated however that "many companies have baulked at risking the money because of the complex, unwieldy and expensive process to earn Chinese certification." By comparison, equivalent certification costs in Australia are less than $2,000 (AUD), with costs in the United States as low as $750 (USD) for a similarly sized business.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manipulative_use_of_regulations">Manipulative use of regulations</span></h3>
<p>Manipulation of certification regulations as a way to mislead or outright dupe the public is a very real concern. Some examples are creating exceptions (allowing non-organic inputs to be used without loss of certification status) and creative interpretation of standards to meet the letter, but not the intention, of particular rules. For example, a complaint filed with the USDA in February 2004 against Bayliss Ranch, a food ingredient producer and its certifying agent, charged that tap water had been certified organic, and advertised for use in a variety of water-based body care and food products, in order to label them "organic" under US law. Steam-distilled plant extracts, consisting mainly of tap water introduced during the distilling process, were certified organic, and promoted as an organic base that could then be used in a claim of organic content. The case was dismissed by the USDA, as the products had been actually used only in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_care_products" title="Personal care products">personal care products</a>, over which the department at the time extended no labeling control. The company subsequently adjusted its marketing by removing reference to use of the extracts in food products. Several months later, the USDA extended its organic labeling to personal care products; this complaint has not been refiled.</p>
<p>In 2013 the Australia Consumer Competition Commission said that water can no longer be labelled as organic water because, based on organic standards, water cannot be organic and it is misleading and deceptive to label any water as such.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="False_Assurance_of_Quality">False Assurance of Quality</span></h3>
<p>The label itself can be used to mislead many customers that foods labelled as being organic are safer, healthier, and more nutritious.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Erosion_of_standards">Erosion of standards</span></h3>
<p>Critics of formal certification also fear an erosion of organic standards. Provided with a legal framework within which to operate, <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" title="Lobbying">lobbyists</a> can push for amendments and exceptions favorable to large-scale production, resulting in "legally organic" products produced in ways similar to current conventional food. Combined with the fact that organic products are now sold predominantly through high volume distribution channels such as <a href="/wiki/Supermarket" title="Supermarket">supermarkets</a>, the concern is that the market is evolving to favor the biggest producers, and this could result in the small organic farmer being squeezed out.</p>
<p>In the United States large food companies, have "assumed a powerful role in setting the standards for organic foods." Many members of standard-setting boards come from large food corporations. As more corporate members have joined, many nonorganic substances have been added to the National List of acceptable ingredients. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> has also played a role in allowing exceptions to organic food standards. In December 2005, the 2006 agricultural appropriations bill was passed with a rider allowing 38 synthetic ingredients to be used in organic foods, including food colorings, starches, sausage and hot-dog casings, hops, fish oil, chipotle chili pepper, and gelatin; this allowed <a href="/wiki/Anheuser-Busch" title="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> in 2007 to have its Wild Hop Lager certified organic "even though [it] uses hops grown with chemical fertilizers and sprayed with pesticides."</p>
