<p>A <b>paradigm shift</b>, as identified by American physicist and philosopher <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn" title="Thomas Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a>, is a fundamental change in the basic <a href="/wiki/Concept" title="Concept">concepts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Experiment" title="Experiment">experimental</a> practices of a <a href="/wiki/Category:Scientific_disciplines" title="Category:Scientific disciplines">scientific discipline</a>. Kuhn contrasted these shifts, which characterize a scientific revolution, to the activity of <a href="/wiki/Normal_science" title="Normal science">normal science</a>, which he described as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original meaning, as "<a href="/wiki/Paradeigma" title="Paradeigma">example</a>" (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <i>παράδειγμα</i>).</p>
<p>The nature of scientific revolutions has been a question posed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Modern_Philosophy" title="Modern Philosophy">modern philosophy</a> since <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> used the phrase in the preface to his <i><a href="/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason" title="Critique of Pure Reason">Critique of Pure Reason</a></i> (1781), referring to <a href="/wiki/Greek_mathematics" title="Greek mathematics">Greek mathematics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Classical_mechanics" title="Classical mechanics">Newtonian physics</a>. In the 20th century, new crises in the basic concepts of <a href="/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Foundational_crisis" title="Foundations of mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">physics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Life#Biology" title="Life">biology</a>, revitalized interest in the question among scholars. It was against this active background that Kuhn published his work.</p>
<p>Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions" title="The Structure of Scientific Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></i> (1962). As one commentator summarizes:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the 1960s, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events, even though Kuhn himself restricted the use of the term to the hard sciences.</p>
<p>In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn, the philosopher <a href="/wiki/Martin_Cohen_(philosopher)" title="Martin Cohen (philosopher)">Martin Cohen</a> describes the notion of the ‘Paradigm Shift’ as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend" title="Paul Feyerabend">Paul Feyerabend</a>, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kuhnian_paradigm_shifts">Kuhnian paradigm shifts</span></h2>

<p>An <a href="/wiki/Epistemology" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> paradigm shift was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and <a href="/wiki/History_of_science" title="History of science">historian of science</a> Thomas Kuhn in his book <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>.</p>
<p>A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire <a href="/wiki/World_view" title="World view">worldview</a> in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.</p>
<p>There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject <a href="/wiki/Karl_Popper" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>'s model of <a href="/wiki/Falsifiability" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating <a href="/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury" title="Tests of general relativity">Mercury's perihelion</a> more troubling than the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Michelson-Morley_experiment" title="Michelson-Morley experiment">Michelson-Morley experiment</a> results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Logical_positivists" title="Logical positivists">logical positivists</a> in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.</p>
<p>When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of <i>crisis,</i> according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a <i>new</i> paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the <a href="/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">Maxwellian</a> <a href="/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations" title="Maxwell's equations">electromagnetic worldview</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Einsteinian</a> <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">relativistic</a> worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Eddington" title="Arthur Eddington">Eddington's</a> photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from <a href="/wiki/Max_Planck" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a>: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."</p>
<p>After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a <i>scientific revolution</i> or a <i>paradigm shift</i>. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term <i>paradigm shift</i> is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Science_and_paradigm_shift">Science and paradigm shift</span></h2>
<p>A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for <a href="/wiki/Relativism" title="Relativism">relativism</a>: the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal. Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is <i>always better</i>, not just different.</p>
<p>These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another — that they are <i>incommensurable</i>. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes — so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher)" title="Donald Davidson (philosopher)">Donald Davidson</a> published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "<i>On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme</i>" (<i>Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association</i>, Vol. 47, (1973-1974), pp. 5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are. Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on <a href="/wiki/Social_science" title="Social science">social science</a> has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, <i>Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity</i>. Cambridge University Press, 1993, <a class="internal mw-magiclink-isbn" href="/wiki/Special:BookSources/0521350344">ISBN 0521350344</a>.)</p>
<p>Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. In 1900, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lord_Kelvin" title="Lord Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> famously told an assemblage of physicists at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" title="British Association for the Advancement of Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement."[veracity of this quote challenged in <a href="/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin#Pronouncements_later_proven_to_be_false" title="William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin">Lord Kelvin article</a>] Five years later, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> published his paper on <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, which challenged the very simple set of rules laid down by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics" title="Newtonian mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a>, which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years.</p>
<p>In <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p. 12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.</p>
<p>Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.</p>

<p>In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals." Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences.</p>

<li>The movement known as the <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_revolution" title="Cognitive revolution">cognitive revolution</a> moved away from <a href="/wiki/Behaviorism" title="Behaviorism">behaviourist</a> approaches to <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychological</a> study and the acceptance of <a href="/wiki/Cognition" title="Cognition">cognition</a> as central to studying human behaviour.</li>
<li>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keynesian_revolution" title="Keynesian revolution">Keynesian revolution</a> is typically viewed as a major shift in <a href="/wiki/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">macroeconomics</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith" title="John Kenneth Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Say%27s_Law" title="Say's Law">Say's Law</a> dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers. In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, <a href="/wiki/John_A._Hobson" title="John A. Hobson">John A. Hobson</a>, who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.</li>
<li>Later, the movement for <a href="/wiki/Monetarism" title="Monetarism">monetarism</a> over <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keynesian" title="Keynesian">Keynesianism</a> marked a second divisive shift.

<p>The term "<b>paradigm shift</b>" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern — a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. <a href="/wiki/University_of_Toronto" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift." In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.</li>
<li>The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy (<a href="/wiki/Carlota_Perez" title="Carlota Perez">Carlota Perez</a>; earlier work only on technological paradigms by <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Dosi" title="Giovanni Dosi">Giovanni Dosi</a>). This concept is linked to <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter" title="Joseph Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a>'s idea of <a href="/wiki/Creative_destruction" title="Creative destruction">creative destruction</a>. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Hans_K%C3%BCng" title="Hans Küng">Hans Küng</a> applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology and <i>Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View</i>.</li>
