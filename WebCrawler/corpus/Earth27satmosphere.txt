<p>In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Temperature_and_speed_of_sound" title="Atmosphere of Earth">temperature</a> section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented <a href="/wiki/Weather_balloon" title="Weather balloon">balloon soundings</a>, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, Earth has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)</li>
<li>Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)</li>
<li>Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)</li>
<li>Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)</li>
<li>Troposphere: 0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Exosphere">Exosphere</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Exosphere" title="Exosphere">Exosphere</a></div>
<p>The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exobase" title="Exobase">exobase</a>, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft) where it merges into the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>.</p>
<p>This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ballistic_trajectories" title="Ballistic trajectories">ballistic trajectories</a> and may migrate in and out of the <a href="/wiki/Magnetosphere" title="Magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>.</p>
<p>The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_borealis" title="Aurora borealis">aurora borealis</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_australis" title="Aurora australis">aurora australis</a> sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermosphere">Thermosphere</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Thermosphere" title="Thermosphere">Thermosphere</a></div>
<p>The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80 km (50 mi; 260,000 ft) up to the <a href="/wiki/Thermopause" title="Thermopause">thermopause</a> at an altitude range of 500–1000 km (310–620 mi; 1,600,000–3,300,000 ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exobase" title="Exobase">exobase</a>. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the <a href="/wiki/Ionosphere" title="Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>.</p>
<p>The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature <a href="/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)" title="Inversion (meteorology)">inversion</a> is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500 °C (2700 °F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases" title="Kinetic theory of gases">temperature in the usual sense</a> is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi; 3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules. Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.</p>
<p>This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_borealis" title="Aurora borealis">aurora borealis</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_australis" title="Aurora australis">aurora australis</a> are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The <a href="/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420 km (220 and 260 mi).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mesosphere">Mesosphere</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Mesosphere" title="Mesosphere">Mesosphere</a></div>
<p>The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 km (31 mi; 160,000 ft) to the mesopause at 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 260,000–280,000 ft) above sea level.</p>
<p>Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the <a href="/wiki/Mesopause" title="Mesopause">mesopause</a> that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around −85 <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">°C</a> (−120 <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" title="Fahrenheit">°F</a>; 190 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a>).</p>
<p>Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric <a href="/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud" title="Noctilucent cloud">noctilucent clouds</a>. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. A type of lightning referred to as either <a href="/wiki/Sprite_(lightning)" title="Sprite (lightning)">sprites</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ELVES" title="ELVES">ELVES</a> occasionally forms far above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meteor" title="Meteor">meteors</a> burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by <a href="/wiki/Sounding_rocket" title="Sounding rocket">sounding rockets</a> and rocket-powered aircraft.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stratosphere">Stratosphere</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">Stratosphere</a></div>
<p>The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the <a href="/wiki/Tropopause" title="Tropopause">tropopause</a>. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft) above Earth's surface to the <a href="/wiki/Stratopause" title="Stratopause">stratopause</a> at an altitude of about 50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).</p>
<p>The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea_level_pressure" title="Sea level pressure">sea level</a>. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation" title="Ultraviolet radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> (UV) radiation from the Sun by the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be −60 °C (−76 °F; 210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0 °C.</p>
<p>The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nacreous_cloud" title="Nacreous cloud">nacreous clouds</a> are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Troposphere">Troposphere</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Troposphere" title="Troposphere">Troposphere</a></div>
<p>The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12 km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9 km (30,000 ft) at the poles to 17 km (56,000 ft) at the <a href="/wiki/Equator" title="Equator">equator</a>, with some variation due to <a href="/wiki/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a>. The troposphere is bounded above by the <a href="/wiki/Tropopause" title="Tropopause">tropopause</a>, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.</p>
<p>Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word τρόπος, <i>tropos</i>, meaning "turn"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the <a href="/wiki/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> of Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6 km (18,000 ft) of the troposphere.</p>
<p>Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">cloud</a> genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_layers">Other layers</span></h3>
<p>Within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a> is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15–35 km (9.3–21.7 mi; 49,000–115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Ionosphere" title="Ionosphere">ionosphere</a> is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)" title="Aurora (astronomy)">auroras</a>. During daytime hours, it stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the <a href="/wiki/Magnetosphere" title="Magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a>. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, <a href="/wiki/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> propagation on Earth.</li>
<li>The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the <i><a href="/wiki/Turbopause" title="Turbopause">turbopause</a></i> found at about 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the very <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" title="Kármán line">edge of space</a> itself as accepted by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Federation_Aeronautique_Internationale" title="Federation Aeronautique Internationale">FAI</a>, which places it about 20 km (12 mi; 66,000 ft) above the mesopause.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer" title="Planetary boundary layer">planetary boundary layer</a> is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through <a href="/wiki/Turbulence" title="Turbulence">turbulent diffusion</a>. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about 100 metres (330 ft) on clear, calm nights to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14 °C (57 °F; 287 K) or 15 °C (59 °F; 288 K), depending on the reference.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pressure_and_thickness">Pressure and thickness</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">Atmospheric pressure</a></div>
<p>The average atmospheric pressure at <a href="/wiki/Sea_level" title="Sea level">sea level</a> is defined by the <a href="/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere" title="International Standard Atmosphere">International Standard Atmosphere</a> as 101325 <a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" title="Pascal (unit)">pascals</a> (760.00 <a href="/wiki/Torr" title="Torr">Torr</a>; 14.6959 <a href="/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" title="Pounds per square inch">psi</a>; 760.00 <a href="/wiki/Millimeter_of_mercury" title="Millimeter of mercury">mmHg</a>). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)" title="Atmosphere (unit)">standard atmospheres (atm)</a>. Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×10 kg (1.135×10 lb), about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and <a href="/wiki/Low-pressure_area" title="Low-pressure area">weather</a>.</p>
<p>If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50 km (27,900 ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6 km (18,000 ft) or by a factor of 1/<a href="/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)" title="E (mathematical constant)">e</a> every 7.64 km (25,100 ft), the average <a href="/wiki/Scale_height" title="Scale height">scale height</a> of the atmosphere below 70 km (43 mi; 230,000 ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.</p>
<p>In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% is below 5.6 km (18,000 ft).</li>
<li>90% is below 16 km (52,000 ft).</li>
<li>99.99997% is below 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" title="Kármán line">Kármán line</a>. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered <a href="/wiki/Astronaut" title="Astronaut">astronauts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848 m (29,029 ft); commercial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Airliners" title="Airliners">airliners</a> typically cruise between 10 km (33,000 ft) and 13 km (43,000 ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weather_balloons" title="Weather balloons">weather balloons</a> reach 30.4 km (100,000 ft) and above; and the highest <a href="/wiki/North_American_X-15" title="North American X-15">X-15</a> flight in 1963 reached 108.0 km (354,300 ft).</p>
<p>Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)" title="Aurora (astronomy)">auroras</a> still occur. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meteors" title="Meteors">Meteors</a> begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply.

By comparison, the <a href="/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> and <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> typically orbit at 350–400 km, within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-layer" title="F-layer">F-layer</a> of the ionosphere where they encounter enough <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_drag" title="Atmospheric drag">atmospheric drag</a> to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800 km.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Temperature_and_speed_of_sound">Temperature and speed of sound</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_temperature" title="Atmospheric temperature">Atmospheric temperature</a> and <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_sound" title="Speed of sound">Speed of sound</a></div>

<p>The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11 km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, starting above about 20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a> caused by capture of significant <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation from the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named <a href="/wiki/Thermosphere" title="Thermosphere">thermosphere</a> above 90 km.</p>
<p>Because in an <a href="/wiki/Ideal_gas" title="Ideal gas">ideal gas</a> of constant composition the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_sound" title="Speed of sound">speed of sound</a> depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Density_and_mass">Density and mass</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Density_of_air" title="Density of air">Density of air</a></div>
<p>The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m (1.2 g/L, 0.0012 g/cm). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the <a href="/wiki/Ideal_gas_law" title="Ideal gas law">ideal gas law</a>). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the <a href="/wiki/Barometric_formula" title="Barometric formula">barometric formula</a>. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.</p>
<p>The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10) <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American <a href="/wiki/National_Center_for_Atmospheric_Research" title="National Center for Atmospheric Research">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a>, "The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">Sunlight</a></div>
<p>Solar <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scattering">Scattering</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Scattering" title="Scattering">Scattering</a></div>
<p>When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, <a href="/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> interact with it through <i>scattering</i>. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called <i>direct radiation</i> and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. <i>Indirect radiation</i> is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an <a href="/wiki/Overcast" title="Overcast">overcast</a> day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called <a href="/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" title="Rayleigh scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why <a href="/wiki/Sunset" title="Sunset">sunsets</a> are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Absorption">Absorption</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)" title="Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)">Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)</a></div>
<p>Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nanometer" title="Nanometer">nanometers</a>. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.</p>

<p>The combined <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absorption_spectra" title="Absorption spectra">absorption spectra</a> of the gases in the atmosphere leave "windows" of low <a href="/wiki/Opacity_(optics)" title="Opacity (optics)">opacity</a>, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The <a href="/wiki/Optical_window" title="Optical window">optical window</a> runs from around 300 nm (<a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>-C) up into the range humans can see, the <a href="/wiki/Visible_spectrum" title="Visible spectrum">visible spectrum</a> (commonly called <a href="/wiki/Light" title="Light">light</a>), at roughly 400–700 nm and continues to the <a href="/wiki/Infrared" title="Infrared">infrared</a> to around 1100 nm. There are also <a href="/wiki/Infrared_window" title="Infrared window">infrared</a> and <a href="/wiki/Radio_window" title="Radio window">radio windows</a> that transmit some infrared and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radio_waves" title="Radio waves">radio waves</a> at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emission">Emission</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)" title="Emission (electromagnetic radiation)">Emission (electromagnetic radiation)</a></div>
<p><i>Emission</i> is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their "<a href="/wiki/Black_body" title="Black body">black body</a>" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a> (5,730 <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">°C</a>; 10,340 <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" title="Fahrenheit">°F</a>), its radiation peaks near 500 nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately 290 K (17 °C; 62 °F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.</p>
<p>Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">cloudy</a> nights. This is because clouds (H<sub>2</sub>O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a> is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Refractive_index">Refractive index</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Refractive_index" title="Refractive index">refractive index</a> of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the <a href="/wiki/Horizon" title="Horizon">horizon</a> because light is refracted in the same direction as the <a href="/wiki/Curvature" title="Curvature">curvature</a> of Earth's surface.</p>
<p>The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the <a href="/wiki/Mirage" title="Mirage">mirage</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Earliest_atmosphere">Earliest atmosphere</span></h3>

As the solar nebula dissipated, these gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_atmosphere">Second atmosphere</span></h3>
<p>Outgassing from <a href="/wiki/Volcanism" title="Volcanism">volcanism</a>, supplemented by gases produced during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Late_heavy_bombardment" title="Late heavy bombardment">late heavy bombardment</a> of Earth by huge <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asteroids" title="Asteroids">asteroids</a>, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> plus <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and inert gases. A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.</p>
<p>Researchers have found water-related sediments dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable "second atmosphere". An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago. How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the "<a href="/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox" title="Faint young Sun paradox">faint young Sun paradox</a>".</p>
<p>The geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early <a href="/wiki/Temperature_record" title="Temperature record">temperature record</a> of Earth - with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late <a href="/wiki/Archean" title="Archean">Archean</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eon_(geology)" title="Eon (geology)">Eon</a> an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing <a href="/wiki/Cyanobacteria" title="Cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" title="Great Oxygenation Event">Great Oxygenation Event</a>), which have been found as <a href="/wiki/Stromatolite" title="Stromatolite">stromatolite</a> fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isotope_ratio" title="Isotope ratio">isotope ratio</a> proportions) very much approximates current conditions, suggesting that the fundamental features of the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_cycle" title="Carbon cycle">carbon cycle</a> became established as early as 4 billion years ago.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Proxy_(climate)#Lake_and_ocean_sediments" title="Proxy (climate)">Ancient sediments</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Gabon" title="Gabon">Gabon</a> dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Third_atmosphere">Third atmosphere</span></h3>

<p>The constant re-arrangement of continents by <a href="/wiki/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a> influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" title="Great Oxygenation Event">Great Oxygenation Event</a> and its appearance is indicated by the end of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Banded_iron_formations" title="Banded iron formations">banded iron formations</a>. Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. This point signifies a shift from a <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">reducing</a> atmosphere to an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidizing" title="Oxidizing">oxidizing</a> atmosphere. O<sub>2</sub> showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian. The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the <a href="/wiki/Phanerozoic" title="Phanerozoic">Phanerozoic</a> Eon, during the earliest period of which, the <a href="/wiki/Cambrian" title="Cambrian">Cambrian</a>, oxygen-requiring <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metazoan" title="Metazoan">metazoan</a> life forms began to appear.</p>
<p>The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</a>, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of <a href="/wiki/Pyrite" title="Pyrite">pyrite</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volcanic_eruption" title="Volcanic eruption">volcanic eruptions</a> release <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for this rapid development of animals.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Scientific_consensus" title="Scientific consensus">scientific consensus</a> is that the <a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">anthropogenic</a> greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>.</p>
