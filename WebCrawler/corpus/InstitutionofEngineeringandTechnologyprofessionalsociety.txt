<p>The <b>Institution of Engineering and Technology</b> (<b>IET</b>) is the largest multidisciplinary professional engineering institution in the world. The IET was formed in 2006 from two separate institutions: the <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Electrical_Engineers" title="Institution of Electrical Engineers">Institution of Electrical Engineers</a> (IEE), dating back to 1871, and the <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Incorporated_Engineers" title="Institution of Incorporated Engineers">Institution of Incorporated Engineers</a> (IIE) dating back to 1884. Its worldwide membership is currently in excess of 167,000. The IET's main offices are in <a href="/wiki/Savoy_Place" title="Savoy Place">Savoy Place</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/London,_England" title="London, England">London, England</a> and at Michael Faraday House in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stevenage,_England" title="Stevenage, England">Stevenage, England</a>.</p>
<p>The IET has the authority to establish professional registration for the titles of Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician, as a Licensed Member institution of the <a href="/wiki/Engineering_Council" title="Engineering Council">Engineering Council</a>.</p>
<p>The IET is registered as a charity in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Formation">Formation</span></h2>
<p>Discussions started in 2004 between the IEE and the IIE about merging to form a new institution. In September 2005, both institutions held votes of the merger and the members voted in favour (73.5% IEE, 95.7% IIE). This merger also needed government approval, so a petition was then made to the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council of the United Kingdom</a> for a Supplemental Charter, to allow the creation of the new institution. This was approved by the Privy Council on December 14, 2005, and the new institution emerged on March 31, 2006.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_the_IEE">History of the IEE</span></h2>
<p>The Society of Telegraph Engineers (STE) was formed on May 17, 1871, and it published the <i>Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers</i> from 1872 through 1880. On December 22, 1880, the STE was renamed as the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians and, as part of this change, it renamed its journal the <i>Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians</i> (1881 – 82) and later the <i>Journal of the Society of Telegraph-Engineers and Electricians</i> (1883 – 88). Following a meeting of its Council on 10 November 1887, it was decided to adopt the name of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). The name of the Institution of Electrical Engineers remains engraved in the marble façade of its headquarters at Savoy Place. As part of this change, its Journal was renamed <i>Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers</i> in 1889, and it kept this title through 1963. In 1921, the Institution was Incorporated by royal charter and, following mergers with the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers (IERE) in 1988 and the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers (IMfgE) in 1990, it had a worldwide membership of around 120,000. The IEE represented the engineering profession, operated Professional Networks (worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests), had an educational role including the accreditation of degree courses and operated schemes to provide awards scholarships, grants and prizes. It was well known for publication of the <i>IEE Wiring Regulations</i> which now continue to be written by the IET and to be published by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Standards_Institution" title="British Standards Institution">British Standards Institution</a> as <a href="/wiki/BS_7671" title="BS 7671">BS 7671</a>.</p>
<p>The IET hosts the archive for the <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_Engineering_Society" title="Women's Engineering Society">Women's Engineering Society</a> (WES) and it has also provided office space for WES since 2005.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_the_IIE">History of the IIE</span></h2>
<p>The modern <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Incorporated_Engineers" title="Institution of Incorporated Engineers">Institution of Incorporated Engineers</a> (IIE) traced its heritage to The Vulcanic Society that was founded in 1884 and became the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1902, which became the Institution of General Technician Engineers in 1970. It changed its name in 1976 to the Institution of Mechanical and General Technician Engineers. At this point it merged with the Institution of Technician Engineers in Mechanical Engineering and formed the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers in 1988. The Institution of Engineers in Charge, which was founded in 1895, was merged into the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE) in 1990.</p>
<p>The Institution of Electrical and Electronic Technician Engineers, the Society of Electronic and Radio Technicians, and the Institute of Practitioners in Radio and Electronics merged in 1990 to form the Institution of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE).</p>
<p>The IIE was formed in April 1998 by the merger of The Institution of Electronic and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE), The Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE), and The Institute of Engineers and Technicians (IET, not to be confused with the later-formed Institution of Engineering and Technology). In 1999 there was a further merger with The Institution of Incorporated Executive Engineers (IIExE). The IIE had a worldwide membership of approximately 40,000.</p>
