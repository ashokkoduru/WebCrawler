augustus ii the strong german august ii der starke polish august ii mocny lithuanian augustas ii 12 may 1670 – 1 february 1733 of the albertine line of the house of wettin was elector of saxony as frederick augustus i imperial vicar and became king of poland as august ii and grand duke of lithuania as augustas ii augustus great physical strength earned him the nicknames the strong the saxon hercules and iron-hand he liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end in order to be elected king of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth augustus converted to roman catholicism as a catholic he received the order of the golden fleece from the holy roman emperor as elector of saxony he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture he established the saxon capital of dresden as a major cultural centre attracting artists from across europe to his court augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in dresden and warsaw his reigns brought poland some troubled times he led the polish-lithuanian commonwealth in the great northern war which led to the russian empire strengthening its influence in europe especially within poland his main pursuit was bolstering royal power in the commonwealth characterized by broad decentralization in comparison with other european monarchies he tried to accomplish this goal using foreign powers and thus destabilized the state early life augustus was born in dresden on 12 may 1670 the younger son of the elector johann georg iii and anne sophie of denmark as the second son augustus had no expectation of inheriting the electorate since his older brother johann georg iv assumed the post after the death of their father on 12 september 1691 augustus married kristiane eberhardine of brandenburg-bayreuth in bayreuth on 20 january 1693 they had a son frederick augustus ii 1696–1763 who succeeded his father as elector of saxony and king of poland as augustus iii while cavorting during the carnival season in venice his older brother the elector johann georg iv contracted smallpox from his mistress magdalene sybille of neidschutz on 27 april 1694 johann georg died without legitimate issue and augustus became elector of saxony as friedrich augustus i conversion to catholicism to be eligible for election to the throne of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in 1697 augustus had to convert to roman catholicism the saxon dukes had traditionally been called champions of the reformation saxony had been a stronghold of german protestantism and augustus conversion was therefore considered shocking in protestant europe although the prince-elector guaranteed saxonys religious status quo augustus conversion alienated many of his protestant subjects as a result of the enormous expenditure of money used to bribe the polish nobility and clergy augustus contemporaries derisively referred to the saxon dukes royal ambitions as his polish adventure his church policy within the holy roman empire followed orthodox lutheranism and ran counter to his new-found religious and absolutist convictions the protestant princes of the empire and the two remaining protestant electors of hanover and prussia were anxious to keep saxony well-integrated in their camp according to the peace of augsburg augustus theoretically had the right to re-introduce roman catholicism see cuius regio eius religio or at least grant full religious freedom to his fellow catholics in saxony but this never happened saxony remained lutheran and the few roman catholics residing in saxony lacked any political or civil rights in 1717 it became clear just how awkward the situation was to realize his ambitious dynastic plans in poland and germany it was necessary for augustus heirs to become roman catholic after five years as a convert his son—the future augustus iii—publicly avowed his roman catholicism the saxon estates were outraged and revolted it was becoming clearer that the conversion to roman catholicism was not only a matter of form but of substance as well since the peace of westphalia the elector of saxony had been the director of the protestant body in the reichstag to placate the other protestant states in the empire augustus nominally delegated the directorship of the protestant body to johann adolf ii duke of saxe-weissenfels however when the electors son also converted to catholicism the electorate faced a hereditary catholic succession instead of a return to a protestant elector upon augustuss death when the conversion became public in 1717 brandenburg-prussia and hanover attempted to oust saxony from the directorship and appoint themselves as joint directors but they gave up the attempt in 1720 saxony would retain the directorship of the protestant body in the reichstag until the dissolution of the holy roman empire in 1806 despite the fact that all remaining electors of saxony were catholic the wife of augustus i the electress christiane eberhardine refused to follow her husbands example and remained a staunch protestant she did not attend her husbands coronation in poland and led a rather quiet life outside dresden gaining some popularity for her stubbornness king of poland for the first time following the death of polish king john iii sobieski and having converted to catholicism augustus was elected king of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in 1697 with the backing of imperial russia and austria which financed him through the banker berend lehmann at the time some questioned the legality of augustus elevation since another candidate françois louis prince of conti had received more votes both candidates conti and augustus were proclaimed as king by different ecclesiastical authorities by primate michaŀ radziejowski and bishop of kujawy stanisław dąmbski respectively with jacob heinrich von flemming swearing to the pacta conventa in augustuss place however augustus hurried to the commonwealth with a saxon army while conti stayed in france for two months augustus continued the war of the holy league against turkey and after a campaign in moldavia his polish army eventually defeated the tatar expedition in the battle of podhajce in 1698 this victory compelled the ottoman empire to sign the treaty of karlowitz in 1699 podolia and kamieniec podolski returned to poland an ambitious ruler augustus hoped to make the polish throne hereditary within his family and to use his resources as elector of saxony to impose some order on the chaotic polish–lithuanian commonwealth he was however soon distracted from his internal reform projects by the possibility of external conquest he formed an alliance with denmarks frederick iv and russias peter i to strip swedens young king charles xii who was augustus cousin of his possessions polands reward for participation in the great northern war was to have been the swedish territory of livonia charles proved an able military commander however quickly forcing the danes out of the war and then driving back the russians at narva thereby allowing him to focus on the struggle with augustus however this war ultimately proved as disastrous for sweden as for poland charles defeated augustus army at riga in july 1701 forcing the polish-saxon army to withdraw from livonia and followed this up with an invasion of poland he captured warsaw on 14 may 1702 defeated the polish-saxon army again at the battle of kliszów and took kraków he defeated another of augustus armies under the command of generalfeldmarschall adam heinrich von steinau at the battle of pułtusk in spring 1703 and besieged and captured thorn toruń by this time augustus was certainly ready for peace but charles felt that he would be more secure if he could establish someone with whom he had more influence on the polish throne in 1704 the swedes installed stanisław leszczyński and tied the commonwealth to sweden which compelled augustus to initiate military operations in poland alongside russia an alliance was concluded in narva in summer 1704 the resulting civil war in poland 1704-1706 and grodno campaign did not go well for august following the battle of fraustadt on 1 september 1706 charles invaded saxony forcing augustus to yield the polish throne to leszczyński by the treaty of altranstädt meanwhile russias tsar peter the great had reformed his army and dealt a crippling defeat to the swedes at the battle of poltava this spelled the end of the swedish empire and the rise of the russian empire king of poland for the second time the weakened polish–lithuanian commonwealth soon came to be regarded as almost a protectorate of russia in 1709 augustus ii returned to the polish throne under russian auspices once again he attempted to establish an absolute monarchy in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth but was faced with opposition from the nobility szlachta see tarnogród confederation peter the great seized on this opportunity to pose as mediator threatened the commonwealth militarily and in 1717 forced augustus and the nobility to sign an accommodation favorable to russian interests at the silent sejm sejm niemy for the remainder of his reign in an uneasy relationship augustus was more or less dependent on russia and to a lesser extent on austria to maintain his throne he gave up his dynastic ambitions and concentrated instead on attempts to strengthen the commonwealth faced with both internal and foreign opposition however he achieved little augustus died at warsaw in 1733 although he had failed to make the polish throne hereditary in his house his eldest son frederick augustus ii of saxony did succeed him to the polish throne as augustus iii of poland—although he had to be installed by the russian army in the war of the polish succession legacy augustus ii and the arts augustus is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture he loved fine arts and architecture and he had beautiful palaces built in dresden a city that became renowned for extraordinary cultural brilliance he introduced the first public museums such as the green vault in 1723 and started systematic collection of paintings that are now on display in the old masters gallery from 1687 to 1689 augustus toured france and italy the extravagant court in versailles—perfectly tailored to fit the needs of an absolute monarch—impressed him deeply in accordance with the spirit of the baroque age augustus invested heavily in the representative splendor of dresden castle his major residence to advertise his wealth and power with strict building regulations major urban development plans and a certain feeling for art the king began to transform dresden into a renowned cultural center with one of germanys finest art collections though most of the citys famous sights and landmarks were completed during the reign of his son augustus iii the most famous building started under augustus the strong was the zwinger also known are pillnitz castle his summer residence moritzburg castle and hubertusburg castle his hunting lodges a man of pleasure the king sponsored lavish court balls venetian-style balli in maschera and luxurious court gatherings games and garden festivities his court acquired a reputation for extravagance throughout europe he held a famous animal-tossing contest in dresden at which 647 foxes 533 hares 34 badgers and 21 wildcats were tossed and killed augustus himself participated reportedly demonstrating his strength by holding the end of his sling by just one finger with two of the strongest men in his court on the other end dresden castle zwinger dresden meissen the late gothic albrechtsburg castle became the meissen porcelain manufacture moritzburg castle pillnitz castle hubertusburg castle meissen porcelain main article meissen porcelain augustus ii successfully sponsored efforts to discover the secret of manufacturing porcelain in 1701 he rescued the young alchemist johann friedrich böttger who had fled from the court of the king of prussia frederick i who had expected that he produce gold for him as he had boasted he could augustus imprisoned böttger and tried to force him to reveal the secret of manufacturing gold böttgers transition from alchemist to potter was orchestrated as an attempt to avoid the impossible demands of the king being an alchemist by profession rather than a potter gave böttger an advantage he realised that the current approaches which involved mixing fine white substances like crushed egg shells into clay would not work rather his approach was to attempt to bake clay at higher temperatures than had ever before been attained in european kilns that approach yielded the breakthrough that had eluded european potters for a century the manufacture of fine porcelain continues at the meissen porcelain factory order of the white eagle main article order of the white eagle poland in november 1705 august founded the order of the white eagle polands first and preeminent order of chivalry in warsaw the saxon garden polish ogród saski commemorates the role of august ii in expanding the citys public places other
