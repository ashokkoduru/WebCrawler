this article is about the chemical element for other uses see carbon disambiguation carbon from latin carbo coal is a chemical element with symbol c and atomic number 6 on the periodic table it is the first row 2 of six elements in column group 14 which have in common the composition of their outer electron shell it is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds three isotopes occur naturally c and c being stable while c is radioactive decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the earths crust and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen carbons abundance its unique diversity of organic compounds and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life it is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass about 18.5 after oxygen the atoms of carbon can be bonded together in different ways termed allotropes of carbon the best known are graphite diamond and amorphous carbon the physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form for example graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper hence its name from the greek verb γράφειν which means to write while diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity under normal conditions diamond carbon nanotubes and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials all carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form they are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen the most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is 4 while 2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes the largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones dolomites and carbon dioxide but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal peat oil and methane clathrates carbon forms a vast number of compounds more than any other element with almost ten million compounds described to date and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions characteristics the allotropes of carbon include graphite one of the softest known substances and diamond the hardest naturally occurring substance it bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with such atoms carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds a large majority of all chemical compounds carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements at atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2 mpa and 4,600 ± 300 k ~4,330 °c or 7,820 °f so it sublimes at about 3,900 k carbon sublimes in a carbon arc which has a temperature of about 5,800 k 5,530 °c 9,980 °f thus irrespective of its allotropic form carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as tungsten or rhenium although thermodynamically prone to oxidation carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper that are weaker reducing agents at room temperature carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on earth and the carbon-nitrogen cycle provides some of the energy produced by the sun and other stars although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions at standard temperature and pressure it resists all but the strongest oxidizers it does not react with sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid chlorine or any alkalis at elevated temperatures carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon oxides and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal this exothermic reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to smelt iron and to control the carbon content of steel with sulfur to form carbon disulfide and with steam in the coal-gas reaction carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides such as the iron carbide cementite in steel and tungsten carbide widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools as of 2009 graphene appears to be the strongest material ever tested the process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes the system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes allotropes main article allotropes of carbon atomic carbon is a very short-lived species and therefore carbon is stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes the three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon graphite and diamond once considered exotic fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research they include buckyballs carbon nanotubes carbon nanobuds and nanofibers several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered such as lonsdaleite questionable glassy carbon carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon carbyne the amorphous form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline irregular glassy state which is essentially graphite but not held in a crystalline macrostructure it is present as a powder and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal lampblack soot and activated carbon at normal pressures carbon takes the form of graphite in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons the resulting network is 2-dimensional and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der waals forces this gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties the sheets slip easily past one another because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud graphite conducts electricity but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet this results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals the delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature at very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope diamond having nearly twice the density of graphite here each atom is bonded tetrahedrally to four others forming a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-membered rings of atoms diamond has the same cubic structure as silicon and germanium and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon bonds it is the hardest naturally occurring substance measured by resistance to scratching contrary to the popular belief that diamonds are forever they are thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into graphite due to a high activation energy barrier the transition into graphite is so slow at normal temperature that it is unnoticeable under some conditions carbon crystallizes as lonsdaleite a hexagonal crystal lattice with all atoms covalently bonded and properties similar to those of diamond fullerenes are a synthetic crystalline formation with a graphite-like structure but in place of hexagons fullerenes are formed of pentagons or even heptagons of carbon atoms the missing or additional atoms warp the sheets into spheres ellipses or cylinders the properties of fullerenes split into buckyballs buckytubes and nanobuds have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in nanomaterials the names fullerene and buckyball are given after richard buckminster fuller popularizer of geodesic domes which resemble the structure of fullerenes the buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally forming spheroids the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped c60 buckminsterfullerene carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow cylinder nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tubebuckyball materials buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube that combine the properties of both in a single structure of the other discovered allotropes carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997 it consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six and seven-membered rings it is among the lightest known solids with a density of about 2 kgm similarly glassy carbon contains a high proportion of closed porosity but contrary to normal graphite the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book but have a more random arrangement linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure ccn carbon in this modification is linear with sp orbital hybridization and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds this carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its youngs modulus is forty times that of the hardest known material – diamond in 2015 a team at the north carolina state university announced the development of another allotrope they have dubbed q-carbon created by a high energy low duration laser pulse on amorphous carbon dust q-carbon is reported to exhibit ferromagetism fluorescence and a hardness superior to diamonds occurrence carbon is the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen carbon is abundant in the sun stars comets and in the atmospheres of most planets some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts in 2014 nasa announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the universe more than 20 of the carbon in the universe may be associated with pahs complex compounds of carbon and hydrogen without oxygen these compounds figure in the pah world hypothesis where they are hypothesized to have a role in abiogenesis and formation of life pahs seem to have been formed a couple of billion years after the big bang are widespread throughout the universe and are associated with new stars and exoplanets it has been estimated that the solid earth as a whole contains 730 ppm of carbon with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust since the mass of the earth is 7024597200000000000♠5.972×10 kg this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon this is much more than the amount of carbon in the oceans or atmosphere below in combination with oxygen in carbon dioxide carbon is found in the earths atmosphere approximately 810 gigatonnes of carbon and dissolved in all water bodies approximately 36,000 gigatonnes of carbon around 1,900 gigatonnes of carbon are present in the biosphere hydrocarbons such as coal petroleum and natural gas contain carbon as well coal reserves not resources amount to around 900 gigatonnes with perhaps 18 000 gt of resources oil reserves are around 150 gigatonnes proven sources of natural gas are about 175 10 cubic metres containing about 105 gigatonnes of carbon but studies estimate another 900 10 cubic metres of unconventional deposits such as shale gas representing about 540 gigatonnes of carbon carbon is also found in methane hydrates in polar regions and under the seas various estimates put this carbon between 500 2500 gt or 3000 gt in the past quantities of hydrocarbons were greater according to one source in the period from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels another source puts the amount added to the atmosphere for the period since 1750 at 879 gt and the total going to the atmosphere sea and land such as peat bogs at almost 2000 gt carbon is a constituent about 12 by mass of the very large masses of carbonate rock limestone dolomite marble and so on coal is very rich in carbon anthracite contains 92–98 and is the largest commercial source of mineral carbon accounting for 4,000 gigatonnes or 80 of fossil fuel as for individual carbon allotropes graphite is found in large quantities in the united states mostly in new york and texas russia mexico greenland and india natural diamonds occur in the rock kimberlite found in ancient volcanic necks or pipes most diamond deposits are in africa notably in south africa namibia botswana the republic of the congo and sierra leone diamond deposits have also been found in arkansas canada the russian arctic brazil and in northern and western australia diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the cape of good hope diamonds are found naturally but about 30 of all industrial diamonds used in the u.s are now manufactured carbon-14 is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere at altitudes of 9–15 km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14 forming carbon-14 and a proton carbon-rich asteroids are relatively preponderant in the outer parts of the asteroid belt in our solar system these asteroids have not yet been directly sampled by scientists the asteroids can be used in hypothetical space-based carbon mining which may be possible in the future but is currently technologically impossible isotopes main article isotopes of carbon isotopes of carbon are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus a number of neutrons varying from 2 to 16 carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes the isotope carbon-12 c forms 98.93 of the carbon on earth while carbon-13 c forms the remaining 1.07 the concentration of c is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against c in 1961 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted the isotope carbon-12 as the basis for atomic weights identification of carbon in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr experiments is done with the isotope c carbon-14 c is a naturally occurring radioisotope created in the upper atmosphere lower stratosphere and upper troposphere by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays it is found in trace amounts on earth of up to 1 part per trillion 0.0000000001 mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits particularly of peat and other organic materials this isotope decays by 0.158 mev β emission because of its relatively short half-life of 5730 years c is virtually absent in ancient rocks the amount of c in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant but decreases predictably in their bodies after death this principle is used in radiocarbon dating invented in 1949 which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000 years there are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortest-lived of these is c which decays through proton emission and alpha decay and has a half-life of 1.98739 s the exotic c exhibits a nuclear halo which means its radius is appreciably larger than would be expected if the nucleus were a sphere of constant density formation in stars main articles triple-alpha process and cno cycle formation of the carbon atomic nucleus requires a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles helium nuclei within the core of a giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei this happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited and therefore no significant carbon was created during the big bang according to current physical cosmology theory carbon is formed in the interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei when those stars die as supernova the carbon is scattered into space as dust this dust becomes component material for the formation of second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets the solar system is one such star system with an abundance of carbon enabling the existence of life as we know it the cno cycle is an additional fusion mechanisms that powers stars wherein carbon operates as a catalyst rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide for example co co and co are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength range and are used in the study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds carbon cycle main article carbon cycle under terrestrial conditions conversion of one element to another is very rare therefore the amount of carbon on earth is effectively constant thus processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else the paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle for example photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or seawater and build it into biomass as in the calvin cycle a process of carbon fixation some of this biomass is eaten by animals while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide the carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop for example some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans if bacteria do not consume it dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal which releases carbon when burned compounds main article compounds of carbon organic compounds carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting c-c bonds a property that is called catenation carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable through catenation carbon forms a countless number of compounds a tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that those that do not a similar claim can be made for hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen the simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon—a large family of organic molecules that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms chain length side chains and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules carbon occurs in all known organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry when united with hydrogen it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as refrigerants lubricants solvents as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of plastics and petrochemicals and as fossil fuels when combined with oxygen and hydrogen carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars lignans chitins alcohols fats and aromatic esters carotenoids and terpenes with nitrogen it forms alkaloids and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics amino acids and rubber products with the addition of phosphorus to these other elements it forms dna and rna the chemical-code carriers of life and adenosine triphosphate atp the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells inorganic compounds commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain hydrogen or fluorine are treated separately from classical organic compounds the definition is not rigid see reference articles above among these are the simple oxides of carbon the most prominent oxide is carbon dioxide co2 this was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere but is a minor component of the earths atmosphere today dissolved in water it forms carbonic acid h 2co 3 but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable through this intermediate though resonance-stabilized carbonate ions are produced some important minerals are carbonates notably calcite carbon disulfide cs 2 is similar the other common oxide is carbon monoxide co it is formed by incomplete combustion and is a colorless odorless gas the molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly polar resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules displacing oxygen which has a lower binding affinity cyanide cn has a similar structure but behaves much like a halide ion pseudohalogen for example it can form the nitride cyanogen molecule cn2 similar to diatomic halides other uncommon oxides are carbon suboxide c 3o 2 the unstable dicarbon monoxide c2o carbon trioxide co3 cyclopentanepentone c5o5 cyclohexanehexone c6o6 and mellitic anhydride c12o9 with reactive metals such as tungsten carbon forms either carbides c or acetylides c2− 2 to form alloys with high melting points these anions are also associated with methane and acetylene both very weak acids with an electronegativity of 2.5 carbon prefers to form covalent bonds a few carbides are covalent lattices like carborundum sic which resembles diamond organometallic compounds main article organometallic chemistry organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal bond a wide range of such compounds exist major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds for example tetraethyllead η-alkene compounds for example zeises salt and η-allyl compounds for example allylpalladium chloride dimer metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands for example ferrocene and transition metal carbene complexes many metal carbonyls exist for example tetracarbonylnickel some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic and not organometallic while carbon is understood to exclusively form four bonds an interesting compound containing an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported the cation of the compound is ph3pau6c this phenomenon has been attributed to the aurophilicity of the gold ligands history and etymology the english name carbon comes from the latin carbo for coal and charcoal whence also comes the french charbon meaning charcoal in german dutch and danish the names for carbon are kohlenstoff koolstof and kulstof respectively all literally meaning coal-substance carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations diamonds were known probably as early as 2500 bce in china while carbon in the form of charcoal was made around roman times by the same chemistry as it is today by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air in 1722 rené antoine ferchault de réaumur demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance now known to be carbon in 1772 antoine lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of carbon dioxide per gram in 1779 carl wilhelm scheele showed that graphite which had been thought of as a form of lead was instead identical with charcoal but with a small admixture of iron and that it gave aerial acid his name for carbon dioxide when oxidized with nitric acid in 1786 the french scientists claude louis berthollet gaspard monge and c a vandermonde confirmed that graphite was mostly carbon by oxidizing it in oxygen in much the same way lavoisier had done with diamond some iron again was left which the french scientists thought was necessary to the graphite structure in their publication they proposed the name carbone latin carbonum for the element in graphite which was given off as a gas upon burning graphite antoine lavoisier then listed carbon as an element in his 1789 textbook a new allotrope of carbon fullerene that was discovered in 1985 includes nanostructured forms such as buckyballs and nanotubes their discoverers – robert curl harold kroto and richard smalley – received the nobel prize in chemistry in 1996 the resulting renewed interest in new forms lead to the discovery of further exotic allotropes including glassy carbon and the realization that amorphous carbon is not strictly amorphous production graphite main article graphite commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world but the most important sources economically are in china india brazil and north korea graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin found in association with quartz mica and feldspars in schists gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins sometimes of a metre or more in thickness deposits of graphite in borrowdale cumberland england were at first of sufficient size and purity that until the 19th century pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood today smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water there are three types of natural graphite—amorphous flake or crystalline flake and vein or lump amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant contrary to science in industry amorphous refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite large amorphous graphite deposits are found in china europe mexico and the united states flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses such as flame retardants the foremost deposits are found in austria brazil canada china germany and madagascar vein or lump graphite is the rarest most valuable and highest quality type of natural graphite it occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps and it is only commercially mined in sri lanka according to the usgs world production of natural graphite was 1.1 million tonnes in 2010 to which china contributed 800,000 t india 130,000 t brazil 76,000 t north korea 30,000 t and canada 25,000 t no natural graphite was reported mined in the united states but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of 998 million was produced in 2009 diamond main article diamond the diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world see figure only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds the ore is crushed during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density today diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of x-ray fluorescence after which the final sorting steps are done by hand before the use of x-rays became commonplace the separation was done with grease belts diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in southern india india led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century bce to the mid-18th century ad but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time india was eclipsed by brazil where the first non-indian diamonds were found in 1725 diamond production of primary deposits kimberlites and lamproites only started in the 1870s after the discovery of the diamond fields in south africa production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5 billion carats have been mined since that date about 20 of that amount has been mined in the last 5 years alone and during the last ten years 9 new mines have started production while 4 more are waiting to be opened soon most of these mines are located in canada zimbabwe angola and one in russia in the united states diamonds have been found in arkansas colorado and montana in 2004 a startling discovery of a microscopic diamond in the united states led to the january 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of montana today most commercially viable diamond deposits are in russia botswana australia and the democratic republic of congo in 2005 russia produced almost one-fifth of the global diamond output reports the british geological survey australia has the richest diamantiferous pipe with production reaching peak levels of 42 metric tons 41 long tons 46 short tons per year in the 1990s there are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the northwest territories of canada siberia mostly in yakutia territory for example mir pipe and udachnaya pipe brazil and in northern and western australia applications carbon is essential to all known living systems and without it life as we know it could not exist see alternative biochemistry the major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil petroleum crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline kerosene and other products cellulose is a natural carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood cotton linen and hemp cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool cashmere and silk plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain the raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil the uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied it can form alloys with iron of which the most common is carbon steel graphite is combined with clays to form the lead used in pencils used for writing and drawing it is also used as a lubricant and a pigment as a molding material in glass manufacture in electrodes for dry batteries and in electroplating and electroforming in brushes for electric motors and as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors charcoal is used as a drawing material in artwork barbecue grilling iron smelting and in many other applications wood coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating gem quality diamond is used in jewelry and industrial diamonds are used in drilling cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons and carbon fiber made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced lightweight composite materials carbon fiber is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of polyacrylonitrile pan and other organic substances the crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material and on the subsequent processing carbon fibers made from pan have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet the result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel carbon black is used as the black pigment in printing ink artists oil paint and water colours carbon paper automotive finishes india ink and laser printer toner carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds activated charcoal is used as an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks water purification and kitchen extractor hoods and in medicine to absorb toxins poisons or gases from the digestive system carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron smelting case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder carbides of silicon tungsten boron and titanium are among the hardest known materials and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass stone and metal diamonds the diamond industry falls into two categories one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other with industrial-grade diamonds while a large trade in both types of diamonds exists the two markets act in dramatically different ways unlike precious metals such as gold or platinum gem diamonds do not trade as a commodity there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant about 80 of mined diamonds equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use known as bort synthetic diamonds invented in the 1950s found almost immediate industrial applications 3 billion carats 600 tonnes of synthetic diamond is produced annually the dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting drilling grinding and polishing most of these applications do not require large diamonds in fact most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments see diamond anvil cell high-performance bearings and limited use in specialized windows with the continuing advances in the production of synthetic diamonds new applications are becoming feasible garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips and because of its exceptional heat conductance property as a heat sink in electronics precautions pure carbon has extremely low toxicity to humans and can be handled and even ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal it is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract consequently once it enters into the bodys tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely carbon black was probably one of the first pigments to be used for tattooing and Ötzi the iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200 years after his death inhalation of coal dust or soot carbon black in large quantities can be dangerous irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease coalworkers pneumoconiosis diamond dust used as an abrasive can harmful if ingested or inhaled microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes and may accumulate in the lungs in these examples the harm may result from contaminants e.g organic chemicals heavy metals rather than from the carbon itself carbon generally has low toxicity to life on earth but carbon nanoparticles are deadly to drosophila carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures large accumulations of coal which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen may spontaneously combust when exposed to air in coal mine waste tips ship cargo holds and coal bunkers and storage dumps in nuclear applications where graphite is used as a neutron moderator accumulation of wigner energy followed by a sudden spontaneous release may occur annealing to at least 250 °c can release the energy safely although in the windscale fire the procedure went wrong causing other reactor materials to combust the great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as tetrodotoxin the lectin ricin from seeds of the castor oil plant ricinus communis cyanide cn and carbon monoxide and such essentials to life as glucose and protein bonding to carbon see also carbon chauvinism carbon footprint low-carbon economy timeline of carbon nanotubes external links carbon on in
