chemical synthesis is a purposeful execution of chemical reactions to obtain a product or several products this happens by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions in modern laboratory usage this tends to imply that the process is reproducible reliable and established to work in multiple laboratories introduction a chemical synthesis—synthesis in its present meaning originating with chemist hermann kolbe—begins with the careful selection of the target based on the relationship of possible targets of chemical functional or therapeutic interest to the broader aims of the research effort whether industrial or academic various further practical concerns come into play including manpower available for the campaign as well as availability of material resources necessary equipment starting materials and bulk chemicals etc and along with these budget for these practical necessities for instance a prior developed reaction methodology may highlight particular man-made or natural compounds that would serve the purposes of the effort in highlighting the breadth of the new methodology alternatively grant or unit budgetary or timeline constraints may necessitate aiming for a simpler member of a family of complex natural products or practical constraints such as the lack of suitable starting materials may necessitate a semi-synthesis over a total synthesis etc once the target or targets are established the next critical phase begins that of synthetic design typically in modern efforts in the area of organic synthesis using retrosynthetic analysis as championed by e.j corey and others an eventual step is selection of compounds that are known as reagents or reactants various reaction types can be applied to these to synthesize the product or an intermediate product this requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask many reactions require some form of work-up procedure before the final product is isolated the isolation purification of the product then proceeds via a variety of methods the amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield typically chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams in a laboratory setting or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced a side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that diminishes the yield of the desired product strategies many strategies exist in chemical synthesis that go beyond converting reactant a to reaction product b in a single step in multistep synthesis a chemical compound is synthesised though a series of individual chemical reactions each with their own work-up for example a laboratory synthesis of paracetamol can consist of three individual synthetic steps in cascade reactions multiple chemical transformations take place within a single reactant in multi-component reactions up to 11 different reactants form a single reaction product and in a telescopic synthesis one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolation of intermediates organic synthesis organic synthesis is a special branch of chemical synthesis dealing with the synthesis of organic compounds in the total synthesis of a complex product it may take multiple steps to synthesize the product of interest and inordinate amounts of time skill in organic synthesis is prized among chemists and the synthesis of exceptionally valuable or difficult compounds has won chemists such as robert burns woodward the nobel prize for chemistry if a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new it is a purely synthetic process if it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to new compounds the synthesis is described as a semisynthetic process inorganic synthesis tradition inorganic preparations organometallic synthesis see also beilstein database chemical engineering electrosynthesis methods in organic synthesis organic synthesis peptide synthesis total synthesis external links the organic synthesis archive natural product syntheses
