the thanet wind farm also sometimes called thanet offshore wind farm is an offshore wind farm 7 miles 11 km off the coast of thanet district in kent england it is the worlds third largest offshore wind farm as of june 2013 the largest being the london array followed by walney wind farm it has a nameplate capacity maximum output of 300 mw and it cost £780–900 million us1.2–1.4 billion thanet is one of fifteen round 2 wind projects announced by the crown estate in january 2004 but the first to be developed it was officially opened on 23 september 2010 when it overtook horns rev 2 as the biggest offshore wind farm in the world it has since been overtaken by walney description the project covers an area of 13.5 square miles 35 km with 500 metres 1,600 ft between turbines and 800 metres 2,600 ft between the rows average water depth is 14–23 metres 46–75 ft planning permission for the project was granted on 18 december 2006 according to thanet offshore wind ltd it was expected to be the largest operational offshore wind farm in the world the thanet project has a total capacity of 300 mw which by yearly average is sufficient to supply approximately 240,000 homes it has an estimated generation of 960 gw·h per year of electricity which means a load factor of 36.5 and an average power density of 3.1 wm² in 2011 the yearly production achieved was 823.88 gw·h which means a load factor of 31.35 two submarine power cables by italy-based prysmian group run from an offshore substation within the wind farm connecting to an existing onshore substation in richborough kent connecting to a world-first two transformers the offshore substation steps up the turbine voltage of 33 kv to 132 kv for the grid maintenance of the turbines is carried out by vestas while a separate maintenance agreement with slp energy covers the turbines foundations turbines are installed by the danish offshore wind farm services provider a2sea the tiv mpi resolution carried and installed the turbines financial structure the thanet scheme is project financed thanet offshore wind ltd tow the project company was owned by hedge fund christofferson robb co it was purchased from a group of sponsors led by warwick energy ltd in august 2008 christofferson robb co placed the project back on the market on 10 november 2008 vattenfall a swedish energy company acquired tow current status the development was due to be in place by 2008 vestas were chosen as the preferred turbine supplier in july 2006 and slp were chosen as preferred supplier for the foundations in september 2006 the project was delayed by a number of issues including problems with vestas who temporarily withdrew their v90 offshore model from the market in 2007 following gearbox problems the v90-3mw was re-released for sales starting from may 2008 vattenfall acquired the project in november 2008 on 28 june 2010 they reported that all turbines had been installed for commissioning due by the end of 2010 the wind farm was completed in september 2010 criticism since turbine construction makes up the majority of the project cost and the uk has no capacity much of the work was contracted to foreign companies resulting in only 20 of the investment going to british firms there have been calls for the creation of a domestic wind industry an article by climate change sceptic and intelligent design supporter christopher booker estimates that due to the wind being intermittent thanet wind farm will only produce 75mw on average the owners will receive a subsidy of £60m per year on top of the £30–40m cost of the electricity due to renewables obligation certificates and based on the estimated working life of the turbines of 20 years the total subsidy will come to £1.2 billion since there are only 21 permanent green jobs the subsidy per job comes to around £3m per year however booker used a generic capacity of 25 lower than vattenfalls estimate for thanet of 35–40 capacity 105–120 mw the working life figure is also lower than other estimates of 40 years extension in june 2010 the crown estate announced that thanet wind farm could be extended to produce an additional 147 mw however in october 2010 vattenfall stated that it would not proceed see also london array wind power in the united kingdom list of offshore wind farms list of offshore wind farms in the united kingdom list of offshore wind farms in the north sea external links a video about the inauguration of thanet offshore wind farm vattenfall uk thanet offshore wind farm a video by vattenfall showing turbine assembly process lorc datasheet for thanet offshore wind farm
