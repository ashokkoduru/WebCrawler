farmed in ways that consider the long-term vitality of harvested species and the well-being of the oceans as well as the livelihoods of fisheries-dependent communities it was first promoted through the sustainable seafood movement which began in the 1990s this operation highlights overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods through a number of initiatives the movement has increased awareness and raised concerns over the way our seafood is obtained importance marine environments are currently under immense pressure their problems primarily arise through anthropogenic causes such as overfishing and environmental destruction however research suggests that fisheries are able to recover or stabilize their populations when responsible management and regulations are in place unfortunately most seafood that is obtained is done so through “irresponsible fishing practices that continue to modify some marine ecosystem.” this has resulted in record depleted stocks for example “85 percent of the world’s fisheries are fished at or beyond their maximum sustainable limit.” considering the rising global population and the pressure that it has and will continue to exert on the earths resources a more sustainable method of fishing is necessary if humans wish to utilize its natural abundance sustainable seafood movement the sustainable seafood movement is an initiative born through the realization that the marine ecosystems of the world were being overexploited and destroyed it began in the 1990s and was driven by social marketing through ecolabel and awareness campaigns through social marketing the collaboration between environmental non-governmental organizations ngos and industry allowed for the consumer to make informed choices potentially contributing to the conservation of marine biodiversity ecolabeling ecolabeling programs evaluate the production process with set environmental standards by an independent third party should the process fulfill the specific requirements the producer or marketer may purchase a license to use an ecolabel in its marketing this label allows the consumer to know that the product was produced sustainably labeling is not only an effective regulatory tool in encouraging consumers to make environmentally friendly choices but it also provides a financial benefit to producers in 1996 the marine stewardship council msc implemented the first certification program since then they have not only made a distinct effort to maintain the health of ecosystems but they have also contributed to more financial success for producers for instance once the american albacore fishing association had its tuna certified to the msc standard they were able to obtain premium prices for their product for the small fishing community in bonita california certification allowed them to sell direct as opposed to depending on the instability on the dock they were able to make a profit of 2,260 rather than 1,700 per tonne more companies and organizations are choosing to use environmentally sustainable production such as ecolabeling to gain a greater market share and higher profits awareness campaigns awareness campaigns focus on educating the public and encouraging them to purchase products that consider the vitality of marine species they do so through boycotts of certain species and products as well as through seafood guides seafood guides highlight which species are acceptable to consume and which are not based on their environmental impact guides are typically constructed into three categories some using the analogy of a traffic lights colours red yellow and green these rankings are based on how the fish responds to fishing pressure abundance gear impact bycatch and management red represents items to avoid yellow is a good alternative and green is the best choice several organizations including the monterey bay aquarium have developed their own guides or wallet cards to be distributed to the public in september 2016 a partnership of google and oceana and skytruth introduced global fishing watch a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing activities seafood guide the seafood guide below made by seachoice highlights which species are best to eat and which should be avoided based on their management abundance and whether they have been caught or farmed in environmentally sustainable ways it allows consumers to be informed of their choices and vote with their wallets fishing methods there are a wide variety of fishing methods used each has its own environment impact that varies on intensity the table below highlights a fishing method along with its environmental repercussions national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa is a national government agency that has authority over conservation marine fisheries and management the noaa has created fishwatch to help guide concerned consumers to sustainable seafood choices the fisheries in the united states are overseen by the ten national standards of the magnuson–stevens fishery conservation and management act therefore the national standards are protecting the fish population and eliminating overfishing along with the magnuson-stevens act u.s fisheries are also regulated under the endangered species act and marine mammal act the noaa fisheries service has started using aquaculture to produce sustainable seafood aquaculture is fish or shellfish farming the aquaculture fisheries hatch and raise the fish until market size by using aquaculture the wild fish will be able to repopulate without the threat of overfishing the aquaculture fish have a variety of uses including food nutritional and pharmaceutical two types of aquaculture exist marine aquaculture farms the fish species that live in the ocean and fresh water aquaculture is the fish species that live in freshwater noaa is focusing on an alternative seafood source to help with repopulate and save the oceans ecosystems marine stewardship council msc the marine stewardship council is a global non-profit organization looking to conserve the oceans their mission is to use a combination of certified fisheries and ecolabeling to make the people aware of how important it is to preserve our oceans the msc works with fisheries scientist seafood companies conservation groups and the public to encourage environmental friendly seafood choices the two main ways the msc regulates sustainable seafood is by setting standards for certified fisheries and ecolabeling the certified fisheries are judged on the three standards the msc provides although the msc does not certified the fisheries but are certified by a third party system to remove any bias the standards were created to decrease overfishing and maintain healthy ecosystems the three standards are maintaining sustainable fish stocks environmental impact effective management once a fishery has been reviewed and certified their certification lasts for 5 years in that 5 years the fishery will be inspected and held to the environmental standards of the msc after the 5 years has passed the fishery will have to go through the approval process again the second way the msc regulates seafood to the public is by using their ecolabel the ecolabel on seafood products guarantees the seafood has come from a sustainable source and certified fishery the ecolabel can be found around the world the consumer can feel good about buying seafood with a msc ecolabel before a seafood product can carry the msc eco-label the fishery must acquire the msc fisheries certification additionally all companies in the supply chain that take ownership of the product including distributors wholesalers manufacturers pack houses traders retailers catering organizations and restaurants must acquire the msc chain of custody certification criticism of the marine stewardship council critics condemn the marine stewardship council for certifying specific fisheries that may be in trouble harmful to the environment or where there is a lack of information available for example the antarctic toothfish fishery in the ross sea was awarded an msc label despite a lack of basic information on the stock itself a marine policy study that analyzed the stocks of msc fisheries found that 31 of the stocks were overfished and 11 did not have suitable information available richard page a greenpeace oceans campaigner stated i will go as far as to say consumers are being duped they think they are buying fish that are sustainable and can eat them with a clean conscience friend of the sea main article friend of the sea friend of the sea is a non-profit international organization that supports the conservation of oceans it was founded by dr paolo bay who started the sustainable seafood movement in europe friends of the sea uses aquaculture and certified fisheries to maintain the seafood stock the certified fisheries are audited by international organization for standardization the criteria to become a certified fishery is the fish stock may not be overexploited no habitat destruction no bycatch of endangered species must follow all laws and regulations reduction of the carbon footprint currently 30 fisheries around the world are certified under the friends of the sea the friends of the sea also participate in the certification of aquaculture the establishment of aquaculture helps reduce the number of wild species caught the iso also audits the aquaculture farms before certification the criteria of aquaculture is there is no environmental impact where the farm is placed must follow all waste water guidelines a very low percentage of escapes no genetically modified organisms growth hormones or antibiotics reduction of the carbon footprint in 2004 aquaculture accounted for 32 of the total production of fish aquaculture is becoming more popular with an 8 rise per year in the last 30 years currently there are 75 aquaculture certified by friends of the sea chefs and restaurants due to growing public concern about overfishing many seafood restaurants have begun to offer more sustainable seafood options with some restaurants specializing in sustainable seafood exemplified by miyas a restaurant headed by chef bun lai a 2016 white house champions of change for sustainable seafood recipient miyasis on the vanguard of the sustainable seafood movement as the first sushi restaurant to specialize in sustainable seafood today there are sustainable sushi restaurants throughout the u.s canada and england and many more sustainable seafood restaurants in general.due to eco-labeling seafood guides traceability schemes sourcing policies and awareness initiatives there are more chefs and restaurants involved in the sustainable seafood movement than ever before organizations such as seafood choices alliance have helped educate chefs about the choices they make in order to encourage more chefs and restaurants to offer sustainable options this is in line with the strict international standards set by eco friendly chef www.ecofriendlychef.com
