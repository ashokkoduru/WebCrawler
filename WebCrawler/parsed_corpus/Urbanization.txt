urbanization is a population shift from rural to urban areas the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas and the ways in which each society adapts to the change it is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas the united nations projected that half of the worlds population would live in urban areas at the end of 2008 it is predicted that by 2050 about 64 of the developing world and 86 of the developed world will be urbanized that is equivalent to approximately 3 billion urbanites by 2050 much of which will occur in africa and asia notably the united nations has also recently projected that nearly all global population growth from 2016 to 2030 will be absorbed by cities about 1.1 billion new urbanites over the next 14 years urbanization is relevant to a range of disciplines including geography sociology economics urban planning and public health the phenomenon has been closely linked to modernization industrialization and the sociological process of rationalization urbanization can be seen as a specific condition at a set time e.g the proportion of total population or area in cities or towns or as an increase in that condition over time so urbanization can be quantified either in terms of say the level of urban development relative to the overall population or as the rate at which the urban proportion of the population is increasing urbanization creates enormous social economic and environmental changes which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the “potential to use resources more efficiently to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.” urbanization is not merely a modern phenomenon but a rapid and historic transformation of human social roots on a global scale whereby predominantly rural culture is being rapidly replaced by predominantly urban culture the first major change in settlement patterns was the accumulation of hunter-gatherers into villages many thousand years ago village culture is characterized by common bloodlines intimate relationships and communal behavior whereas urban culture is characterized by distant bloodlines unfamiliar relations and competitive behavior this unprecedented movement of people is forecast to continue and intensify during the next few decades mushrooming cities to sizes unthinkable only a century ago today in asia the urban agglomerations of osaka karachi jakarta mumbai shanghai manila seoul and beijing are each already home to over 20 million people while delhi and tokyo are forecast to approach or exceed 40 million people each within the coming decade outside asia mexico city são paulo new york lagos los angeles and cairo are or soon will be home to over 20 million people history from the development of the earliest cities in mesopotamia and egypt until the 18th century an equilibrium existed between the vast majority of the population who engaged in subsistence agriculture in a rural context and small centres of populations in the towns where economic activity consisted primarily of trade at markets and manufactures on a small scale due to the primitive and relatively stagnant state of agriculture throughout this period the ratio of rural to urban population remained at a fixed equilibrium though a significant increase in the persentage of the global urban population can still be traced in the 1st millennium bce with the onset of the agricultural and industrial revolution in the late 18th century this relationship was finally broken and an unprecedented growth in urban population took place over the course of the 19th century both through continued migration from the countryside and due to the tremendous demographic expansion that occurred at that time in england the proportion of the population living in cities jumped from 17 in 1801 to 72 in 1891 for other countries the figure was 37 in france 41 in prussia and 28 in the united states as labourers were freed up from working the land due to higher agricultural productivity they converged on the new industrial cities like manchester and birmingham which were experiencing a boom in commerce trade and industry growing trade around the world also allowed cereals to be imported from north america and refrigerated meat from australasia and south america spatially cities also expanded due to the development of public transport systems which facilitated commutes of longer distances to the city centre for the working class urbanization rapidly spread across the western world and since the 1950s it has begun to take hold in the developing world as well at the turn of the 20th century just 15 of the world population lived in cities according to the un the year 2007 witnessed the turning point when more than 50 of the world population were living in cities for the first time in human history yale university in june 2016 published urbanization data from the time period 3700 bc to 2000 ad the data was used to make a video showing the development of cities on the world during the time period movement as more and more people leave villages and farms to live in cities urban growth results the rapid growth of cities like chicago in the late 19th century tokyo in the mid 20th and delhi in the 21st century can be attributed largely to rural-urban migration this kind of growth is especially commonplace in developing countries this phenomenal growth can be attributed not just to the lure of economic opportunities but also to loss or degradation of farmland and pastureland due to development pollution land grabs or conflict the attraction and anonymity of hedonistic pleasures of urban areas proximity and ease of mass transport and the opportunity to assert individualism urban centres are seen by many as an opportunity to escape traditional patriarchy and experience new freedoms this includes greater access to education health and employment however for many who seek these opportunities the opposite occurs resulting in extreme poverty exclusion vulnerability and marginalization due to urban sprawl where urban land is expanding much faster than the urban population this results in a strain on the urban area the urban poor are forced to create slums and then ultimately face unhealthy living conditions without access to the very opportunities they sought in the first place urbanization isnt just developing cities street but its also redeveloping a people and a culture by displacement and economic hardship.the united nations population fund unfpa estimated that residents in slums had risen to about 863 million in 2012 from over 650 million in 1990 the rapid urbanization of the worlds population over the 20th century is described in the 2005 revision of the un world urbanization prospects report the global proportion of urban population rose dramatically from 13 220 million in 1900 to 29 732 million in 1950 and 49 3.2 billion in 2005 the same report projected that the figure is likely to rise to 60 4.9 billion by 2030 it is expected that from 2007 to 2050 the global urban population will nearly double from 3.3 billion to 6.4 billion absorbing all population growth and as well as inflows from rural areas according to the unfpa state of the world population 2007 report sometime in the middle of 2007 the majority of people worldwide lived in towns or cities for the first time in history this is referred to as the arrival of the urban millennium or the tipping point in future it is estimated 93 of urban growth will occur in developing nations with 80 of urban growth occurring in asia and africa urbanization rates vary between countries the united states and united kingdom have a far higher urbanization level than india swaziland and niger but a far slower annual urbanization rate since much less of the population is living in a rural area some nations make a distinction between suburban and urban areas while others do not indeed human conditions within such areas differ greatly causes urbanization occurs as individual commercial flight social and government action reduce the time and expense of commuting and transportation and improve opportunities for jobs education housing and transportation living in a city can provide opportunities of proximity diversity and marketplace competition as against this there may be alienation issues stress increased cost of living and negative social aspects that result from mass marginalization suburbanization which is happening in the cities of the largest developing countries may be regarded as an attempt to balance these negative aspects of urban life while still allowing access to the large extent of shared resources in cities money services wealth and opportunities are centralized many rural inhabitants come to the city to seek their fortune and alter their social position businesses which provide jobs and exchange capital are more concentrated in urban areas whether the source is trade or tourism it is also through the ports or banking systems commonly located in cities that foreign money flows into a country many people move into cities for the economic opportunities but this does not fully explain the very high recent urbanization rates in places like china and india rural flight is a contributing factor to urbanization in rural areas often on small family farms or collective farms in villages it has historically been difficult to access manufactured goods though the relative overall quality of life is very subjective and may certainly surpass that of the city farm living has always been susceptible to unpredictable environmental conditions and in times of drought flood or pestilence survival may become extremely problematic thai farmers are seen as poor stupid and unhealthy as young people flee the farms the values and knowledge of rice farming and the countryside are fading including the tradition of long kek helping neighbors plant harvest or build a house we are losing what we call thai-ness the values of being kind helping each other having mercy and gratefulness.— iam thongdee professor of humanities mahidol university in bangkok in a new york times article concerning the acute migration away from farming in thailand life as a farmer was described as hot and exhausting everyone says the farmer works the hardest but gets the least amount of money in an effort to counter this impression the agriculture department of thailand is seeking to promote the impression that farming is honorable and secure however in thailand urbanization has also resulted in massive increases in problems such as obesity city life especially in modern urban slums of the developing world is certainly hardly immune to pestilence or climatic disturbances such as floods yet continues to strongly attract migrants examples of this were the 2011 thailand floods and 2007 jakarta flood urban areas are also far more prone to violence drugs and other urban social problems in the united states industrialization of agriculture has negatively affected the economy of small and middle-sized farms and strongly reduced the size of the rural labour market these are the costs of participating in the urban economy your increased income is canceled out by increased expenditure in the end you have even less left for food —madhura swaminathan economist at kolkata’s indian statistical institute particularly in the developing world conflict over land rights due to the effects of globalization has led to less politically powerful groups such as farmers losing or forfeiting their land resulting in obligatory migration into cities in china where land acquisition measures are forceful there has been far more extensive and rapid urbanization 54 than in india 36 where peasants form militant groups e.g naxalites to oppose such efforts obligatory and unplanned migration often results in rapid growth of slums this is also similar to areas of violent conflict where people are driven off their land due to violence bogota colombia is one example of this cities offer a larger variety of services including specialist services not found in rural areas these services requires workers resulting in more numerous and varied job opportunities elderly people may be forced to move to cities where there are doctors and hospitals that can cater for their health needs varied and high quality educational opportunities are another factor in urban migration as well as the opportunity to join develop and seek out social communities urbanization also creates opportunities for women that are not available in rural areas this creates a gender-related transformation where women are engaged in paid employment and have access to education this may cause fertility to decline however women are sometimes still at a disadvantage due to their unequal position in the labour market their inability to secure assets independently from male relatives and exposure to violence people in cities are more productive than in rural areas an important question is whether this is due to agglomeration effects or whether cities simply attract those who are more productive economists have recently shown that there exists a large productivity gain due to locating in dense agglomerations it is thus possible that agents locate in cities in order to benefit from these agglomeration effects dominant conurbation see also list of largest cities throughout history see also primate city the dominant conurbations of a country can benefit to a greater extent from the same things cities offer making them magnets for not just the non-urban population but also urban and suburban population from other cities dominant conurbations are quite often primate cities but do not have to be for instance greater manila is rather a conurbation than a city its 20 million overall population over 20 national population make it very much a primate city but quezon city 2.7 million the largest municipality in greater manila and manila 1.6 million the capital are not a conurbations dominance can be measured by output wealth and especially population each expressed as a percentage of an entire country greater seoul is one conurbation with massive dominance over south korea it is home to 50 of the entire national population though greater busan-ulsan 15 8 million and greater osaka 14 18 million exhibit strong dominance in their respective countries yet they are losing population to their even more dominant rivals seoul and tokyo respectively economic effect as cities develop effects can include a dramatic increase and change in costs often pricing the local working class out of the market including such functionaries as employees of the local municipalities for example eric hobsbawms book the age of revolution 1789–1848 published 1962 and 2005 chapter 11 stated urban development in our period 1789–1848 was a gigantic process of class segregation which pushed the new labouring poor into great morasses of misery outside the centres of government and business and the newly specialized residential areas of the bourgeoisie the almost universal european division into a good west end and a poor east end of large cities developed in this period this is likely due the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind making the western edges of towns preferable to the eastern ones similar problems now affect the developing world rising inequality resulting from rapid urbanization trends the drive for rapid urban growth and often efficiency can lead to less equitable urban development think tanks such as the overseas development institute have proposed policies that encourage labor-intensive growth as a means of absorbing the influx of low-skilled and unskilled labor one problem these migrant workers are involved with is the growth of slums in many cases the rural-urban low skilled or unskilled migrant workers attracted by economic opportunities in urban areas cannot find a job and afford housing in cities and have to dwell in slums urban problems along with infrastructure developments are also fueling suburbanization trends in developing nations though the trend for core cities in said nations tends to continue to become ever denser urbanization is often viewed as a negative trend but there are positives in the reduction of expenses in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs education housing and transportation living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity and diversity while cities have a greater variety of markets and goods than rural areas infrastructure congestion monopolization high overhead costs and the inconvenience of cross-town trips frequently combine to make marketplace competition harsher in cities than in rural areas in many developing countries where economies are growing the growth is often erratic and based on a small number of industries for young people in these countries barriers exist such as lack of access to financial services and business advisory services difficulty in obtaining credit to start a business and lack of entrepreneurial skills in order for them to access opportunities in these industries investment in human capital so that young people have access to quality education and infrastructure to enable access to educational facilities is imperative to overcoming economic barriers environmental effects the existence of urban heat islands has become a growing concern over the years an urban heat island is formed when industrial and urban areas produce and retain heat much of the solar energy that reaches rural areas is consumed by evaporation of water from vegetation and soil in cities where there is less vegetation and exposed soil most of the suns energy is instead absorbed by buildings and asphalt leading to higher surface temperatures vehicles factories and industrial and domestic heating and cooling units release even more heat as a result cities are often 1 to 3 °c 1.8 to 5.4 °f warmer than surrounding landscapes impacts also include reducing soil moisture and a reduction in reabsorption of carbon dioxide emissions the occurrence of eutrophication in bodies of water is another effect large urban populations have on the environment when rain occurs in these large cities the rain filters down the pollutants such as co2 and other green house gases in the air onto the ground below then those chemicals are washed directly into rivers streams and oceans causing a decline in water quality and damaging marine ecosystems in his book whole earth discipline stewart brand argues that the effects of urbanization are primarily positive for the environment first the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate and keeps falling reducing environmental stresses caused by population growth secondly emigration from rural areas reduces destructive subsistence farming techniques such as improperly implemented slash and burn agriculture in july 2013 a report issued by the united nations department of economic and social affairs warned that with 2.4 billion more people by 2050 the amount of food produced will have to increase by 70 straining food resources especially in countries already facing food insecurity due to changing environmental conditions the mix of changing environmental conditions and the growing population of urban regions according to un experts will strain basic sanitation systems and health care and potentially cause a humanitarian and environmental disaster health and social effects when cities don’t plan for increases in population it drives up house and land prices creating rich ghettos and poor ghettos you get a very unequal society and that inequality is manifested where people live in our neighbourhoods and it means there can be less capacity for empathy and less development for all society— jack finegan urban programme specialist at un-habitat in the developing world urbanization does not seem to translate into a significant increase in life expectancy rapid urbanization has brought increased mortality from non-communicable diseases associated with lifestyle including cancer and heart disease differences in mortality from contagious diseases vary depending on the particular disease urban health levels are better in comparison those in rural areas on average however residents in poor areas such as slums and informal settlements suffer disproportionately from disease injury premature death and the combination of ill-health and poverty entrenches disadvantage over time many urban poor have difficulty accessing health services due to an increasing requirement to pay for them so people resort to less qualified and unregulated providers while urbanization is associated with improvements in public hygiene sanitation and access to health care it also entails changes in occupational dietary and exercise patterns it can have mixed effects on health patterns alleviating some problems and accentuating others for instance in children urbanization is associated with a lower risk of under-nutrition but a higher risk of overweight overall body mass index and cholesterol levels increase sharply with national income and the degree of urbanization agriculturist has new studied on urbanization and globalization fast food is the food of chose which is causing health decline easier access to non-traditional foods may lead to less healthy dietary patterns in india prevalence of diabetes in urban areas appears to be more than twice as high as in rural areas in general major risk factors for chronic diseases are more prevalent in urban environments changing forms different forms of urbanization can be classified depending on the style of architecture and planning methods as well as historic growth of areas in cities of the developed world urbanization traditionally exhibited a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area the so-called in-migration in-migration refers to migration from former colonies and similar places the fact that many immigrants settle in impoverished city centres led to the notion of the peripheralization of the core which simply describes that people who used to be at the periphery of the former empires now live right in the centre recent developments such as inner-city redevelopment schemes mean that new arrivals in cities no longer necessarily settle in the centre in some developed regions the reverse effect originally called counter urbanization has occurred with cities losing population to rural areas and is particularly common for richer families this has been possible because of improved communications and has been caused by factors such as the fear of crime and poor urban environments it has contributed to the phenomenon of shrinking cities experienced by some parts of the industrialized world when the residential area shifts outward this is called suburbanization a number of researchers and writers suggest that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown both in developed and developing countries such as india this networked poly-centric form of concentration is considered by some emerging pattern of urbanization it is called variously exurbia edge city garreau 1991 network city batten 1995 or postmodern city dear 2000 los angeles is the best-known example of this type of urbanization interestingly in the united states this process has reversed as of 2011 with re-urbanization occurring as suburban flight due to chronically high transport costs rural migrants are attracted by the possibilities that cities can offer but often settle in shanty towns and experience extreme poverty the inability of countries to provide adequate housing for these rural migrants is related to overurbanization a phenomenon in which the rate of urbanization grows more rapidly that the rate of economic development leading to high unemployment and high demand for resources in the 1980s this was attempted to be tackled with the urban bias theory which was promoted by michael lipton the most important class conflict in the poor countries of the world today is not between labour and capital nor is it between foreign and national interests it is between rural classes and urban classes the rural sector contains most of the poverty and most of the low-cost sources of potential advance but the urban sector contains most of the articulateness organization and power so the urban classes have been able to win most of the rounds of the struggle with the countryside....— michael lipton author of urban bias theory most of the urban poor in developing countries able to find work can spend their lives in insecure poorly paid jobs according to research by the overseas development institute pro-poor urbanization will require labour-intensive growth supported by labour protection flexible land use regulation and investments in basic services urbanization can be planned urbanization or organic planned urbanization i.e planned community or the garden city movement is based on an advance plan which can be prepared for military aesthetic economic or urban design reasons examples can be seen in many ancient cities although with exploration came the collision of nations which meant that many invaded cities took on the desired planned characteristics of their occupiers many ancient organic cities experienced redevelopment for military and economic purposes new roads carved through the cities and new parcels of land were cordoned off serving various planned purposes giving cities distinctive geometric designs un agencies prefer to see urban infrastructure installed before urbanization occurs landscape planners are responsible for landscape infrastructure public parks sustainable urban drainage systems greenways etc which can be planned before urbanization takes place or afterward to revitalize an area and create greater livability within a region concepts of control of the urban expansion are considered in the american institute of planners as the population continues to grow and urbanize at unprecedented rates new urbanism and smart growth techniques will create a successful transition into developing environmentally economically and socially sustainable cities smart growth and new urbanism’s principles include walkability mixed-use development comfortable high-density design land conservation social equity and economic diversity mixed-use communities work to fight gentrification with affordable housing to promote social equity decrease automobile dependency to lower use of fossil fuels and promote a localized economy walkable communities have a 38 higher average gdp per capita than less walkable urban
