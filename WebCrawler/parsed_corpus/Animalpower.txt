a working animal is an animal usually domesticated that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks they may be close members of the family such as guide dogs or other assistance dogs or they may be animals trained to provide tractive force such as draft horses or logging elephants the latter types of animals are called draft animals draught animals or beasts of burden most working animals are either service animals or draft animals they may also be used for milking or herding jobs that require human training to encourage the animal to cooperate some at the end of their working lives may also be used for meat or other products such as leather the history of working animals may predate agriculture with dogs used by our hunter-gatherer ancestors around the world millions of animals work in relationship with their owners domesticated species are often bred to be suitable for different uses and conditions especially horses and working dogs working animals are usually raised on farms though some are still captured from the wild such as dolphins and some asian elephants people have found uses for a wide variety of abilities found in animals and even in industrialized society many animals are still used for work the strength of horses elephants and oxen is used in pulling carts and logs the keen sense of smell of dogs is used to search for drugs and explosives as well helping to find game while hunting and to search for missing or trapped people several animals including camels donkeys horses and dogs are used for transport either riding or to pull wagons and sleds other animals including dogs and monkeys provide assistance to blind or disabled people on rare occasions wild animals may be not only tamed but trained to perform work though often solely for novelty or entertainment purposes as such animals tend to lack the traits of trustworthiness and mild temper that characterize the true domesticated working animal conversely not all domesticated animals are working animals for example while cats may perform work catching mice it is an instinctive behavior not one that can be trained by human intervention other domesticated animals such as sheep or rabbits may have agricultural uses for meat hides and wool but are not suitable for work finally small domestic pets such as most birds other than certain types of pigeon or hamsters are generally incapable of performing work other than that of providing simple companionship roles and specializations transportation some animals are used due to sheer physical strength in tasks such as ploughing or logging such animals are grouped as a draught or draft animal others may be used as pack animals for animal-powered transport the movement of people and goods people ride some animals directly as mounts alternatively one or more animals in harness may be used to pull vehicles riding animals or mounts they include equines such as horses ponies donkeys and mules elephants yaks and camels dromedary camels in arid areas of australia north africa and the middle east the less common bactrian camel inhabits central and east asia both are used as working animals on occasion reindeer though usually driven may be ridden certain wild animals have been tamed and used for riding usually for novelty purposes including the zebra and the ostrich some mythical creatures are believed to act as divine mounts such as garuda in hinduism and the winged horse pegasus in greek mythology pack animals main article pack animal pack animals may be of the same species as mounts or harness animals though animals such as horses mules donkeys reindeer and both types of camel may have individual bloodlines or breeds that have been selectively bred for packing additional species are only used to

intermediate use is to harness animals singly or in teams to pull or haul sleds wheeled vehicles or plough oxen are slow but strong and have been used in a yoke since ancient times the earliest surviving vehicle puabis sumerian sledge was ox-drawn an acre was originally defined as the area a span of oxen could plow in a day the water buffalo and carabao domesticated water buffalo pull wagons and ploughs in southeast asia and the philippines draught or draft horses are commonly used in harness for heavy work several breeds of medium-weight horses are used to pull lighter wheeled carts carriages and buggies when a certain amount of speed or style is desirable mules are considered to be very tough and strong with harness capacity dependent on the type of horse mare used to produce the mule foal because they are a hybrid animal and usually are infertile separate breeding programs must also be maintained ponies and donkeys are often used to pull carts and small wagons historically ponies were commonly used in mining to pull ore carts dogs are used for pulling light carts or particularly sleds e.g sled dogs such as huskies for both recreation and working purposes goats also can perform light harness work in front of carts reindeer are used in the arctic and sub-arctic nordic countries and siberia during world war ii the red army deployed deer transportation battalions on the eastern front in the twenty-first century russian soldiers continue to train with reindeer sleds in winter elephants are still used for logging in south-east asia less often camels and llamas have been trained to harness according to juan ignacio molina the dutch captain joris van spilbergen observed the use of chiliquenes a llama type by native mapuches of mocha island as plough animals in 1614 assorted wild animals have on occasion been tamed and trained to harness including zebras and even moose see also driving horse searching and retrieving hunting as predatory species are naturally equipped to catch prey this is a further use for animals and birds this can be done either for sustenance sport or to reduce the population of undesired animals that are considered harmful to crops livestock or the environment hounds and other dogs are used to kill and fetch prey certain breeds have been bred for this task such as pointers and setters mousers domestic

on creatures living in burrows such as rabbits in falconry birds of prey are used as hunters in the air aquatic birds such as cormorants in china can be used to catch fish humans dogs with their highly developed sense of smell are used to locate humans such as escaped prisoners or people lost in remote areas they are used also to find people who are trapped such as in avalanches or collapsed buildings horses are used in remote areas to help human searchers cover large areas of rugged terrain their natural awareness of their surroundings will often alert human handlers to the presence of anything unusual including lost hikers hunters or other like some dogs some horses are trained to follow scent see search and rescue horse sniffing animals dogs and pigs with better smell sense than humans can assist with gathering by finding valuable products such as truffles a very expensive subterranean mushroom in france mainly pigs are used in italy mainly dogs see truffle hog interfacing
