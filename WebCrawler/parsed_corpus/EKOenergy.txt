ekoenergy is an ecolabel for electricity it is a not-for-profit initiative of the ekoenergy network a group of more than 40 environmental organizations from 30 countries ekoenergy started in 2013 in europe its secretariat is based in helsinki nowadays ekoenergy is the only international ecolabel for renewable electricity it is available all over the world and its material is available in more than 30 languages governance every member organization all not-for-profit organisations appoints one person to the ekoenergy board the network’s highest governing authority the board takes decisions in consultation with the advisory group which consist of experts from different stakeholder groups including electricity industry consumers and environmentalists among others label other language version of the label can be found in various countries e.g ekoénergie in france ekoenergie in germany or ekoenergia in finland criteria of the ecolabel only electricity from renewable sources can be sold as ekoenergy but ekoenergy is more than just green electricity ekoenergy also sets criteria for the following aspects consumer information consumers get information about where and how the electricity has been produced sustainability ekoenergy takes into account the impacts of electricity production on ecosystem services habitats and the biodiversity of species firstly it does this by excluding the most environmentally degrading and problematic electricity production methods secondly it finances river restoration through an environmental fund climate per every mwh sold minimum 10 euro cents will be paid into the ekoenergy climate fund tracking of the electricity the criteria are based on the european best practice and on the recommendations of re-disseped auditing and verification all ekoenergy claims are verified by independent auditors users of the label well known sellers of ekoenergy certified electricity include fortum vattenfall ekosähkö and gesternova also sellers of electricity tracking certificates can help consumers to get ekoenergy e.g ecohz and south pole group a full list of licensed sellers can be found on ekoenergy’s website httpwww.ekoenergy.orgbuying-ekoenergylicensees an increasing number of ekoenergy consumers uses the label in its own communication e.g otava printing and saimaan juomatehdas results climate fund for each mwh of ekoenergy sold the seller pays a minimum of €0.10 to ekoenergy’s climate fund this money is used to finance climate projects that would not have happened without the contributions these projects are managed by experienced organisations all projects are selected in an open process with sellers buyers and independent experts actively involved examples of funded projects solar panels for tanzanian schools solar panels for schools in cameroon ekoenergy’s environmental fund and nature conservation whenever hydropower is sold with the ekoenergy label €0.10 mwh go to the environmental fund to finance river restoration projects examples of earlier funded projects murronjoki river restoration finland norina river restoration latvia ekoenergy mentioned in other environmental standards leed the european versions of the leed standard explicitly recommend the use of ekoenergy labelled electricity buildings aiming at leed certification can get extra points if the electricity used in that building is ekoenergy certified the text “leed 2009 bdc supplemental reference guide with alternative compliance paths for europe” gives ekoenergy the same status as green-e certified recs in the us they write the ekoenergy electricity certification scheme represents the best available pan-european option for the sustainable and additional consumption of renewable electricity within europe ekoenergy certifies renewable electricity that goes beyond the regulations of european directives and national governments of europe greenhouse gas protocol the greenhouse gas protocol is a worldwide standard for carbon accounting it is a joint product of the world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development in january 2015 the secretariat of the greenhouse gas protocol published the scope 2 guidance which gave advice about carbon accounting the guidance refers to ekoenergy several times chapter 11 which encourages companies to go one step further refers to ekoenergy’s climate fund cdp cdp works with 5000 of the largest corporations in the world to help them calculate their carbon emissions and to help them develop effective carbon emission reduction strategies on page 15 and 16 of its technical notes for accounting of scope 2 emissions i.e emissions related to the production of purchased electricity cdp explains how companies can do more “ecolabels are a way for companies to do more with their purchases ekoenergy mentioned by the ghg protocol scope 2 guidance is such an option it is a mark of quality which comes on top of tracking certificates electricity sold with the ekoenergy label fulfills strict environmental criteria and raises funds for new renewable energy projects involvement transparency and ‘deeds not words’ are important principles of ekoenergy’s work.” httpswww.cdp.netdocumentsguidance2016cdp-technical-note-accounting-of-scope-2-emissions-2016.pdf p.16 retrieved 31 october 2016
