the global hectare gha is a measurement unit for quantifying both the ecological footprint of people or activities as well as the biocapacity of the earth or its regions one global hectare represents the average productivity of all biologically productive areas measured in hectares on earth in a given year examples of biologically productive areas include cropland forests and fishing grounds they do not include deserts glaciers and the open ocean global hectare per person refers to the amount of biologically productive land and water available per person on the planet the total number of global hectares is approximately 11.3 billion averaging about 1.8 global hectares per person 2004 a total of 13.4 billion hectares were used or 2.2 global hectares per person meaning about 20 more was consumed than produced this is possible because there are natural reserves all around the globe that function as backup food material and energy supplies although only for a relatively short period of time due to rapid population growth these reserves are being depleted at an ever increasing tempo see earth overshoot day applications the global hectare is a useful measure of biocapacity as it can convert things like human dietary requirements into a physical area which can show how many people a certain region on earth can sustain assuming current technologies and agricultural methods it can be used as a way of determining the relative carrying capacity of the earth a given hectare of land may be measured in equivalent global hectares for example a hectare of lush area with high rainfall would be scale higher in global hectares than would a hectare of desert it can also be used to show that consuming different foods may increase the earths ability to support larger populations to illustrate producing meat generally requires more land and energy than what producing vegetables requires sustaining a meat-based diet would require a less populated planet hectare equivalents the average global hectare would occupy the area of a standard hectare a hectare ˈhɛktɛər symbol ha is a unit of area equal to 10,000 square metres 107,639 sq ft a square 100 metres on each side or a square 328.08 feet on each side 2.471 acre 0.00386102 square miles or one square hectometre 100 metres squared see also business and economics portal ecology portal environment portal balance of nature ecological footprint energy returned on energy invested land economics natural resource economics social metabolism water use earth overshoot day footnotes
