and development the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is a government-owned contractor-operated facility and is funded through the united states department of energy doe this arrangement allows a private entity to operate the lab on behalf of the federal government under a prime contract nrel receives funding from congress to be applied toward research and development projects nrel also performs research on photovoltaics pv under the national center for photovoltaics nrel has a number of pv research capabilities including research and development testing and deployment nrels campus houses several facilities dedicated to pv research history established in 1974 nrel began operating in 1977 as the solar energy research institute under the jimmy carter administration it was the recipient of a large budget and its activities went beyond research and development in solar energy as it tried to popularize knowledge about already existing technologies like passive solar amongst the population during the ronald reagan administration the institutes budget was cut by some 90 many employees reduced in force and the laboratorys activities were reduced to rd in later years renewed interest in the energy problem improved the institutes position but funding has fluctuated in 2006 funding had dropped to the point that nrel was forced to lay off 32 workers and in 2011 anticipated congressional budget shortfalls led to a voluntary buyout program for 100 to 150 staff reductions since its inception in 1977 as the solar energy research institute it has been operated under contract by mriglobal in september 1991 the nrel was designated a national laboratory of the u.s department of energy doe by president george h.w bush and its name was changed to nrel currently nrel is managed for the doe by the alliance for sustainable energy llc the alliance was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between mriglobal and battelle dr dan e arvizu became nrels eighth laboratory director in january 2005 and currently serves as both the director of the lab and president of the alliance nrels areas of research and development expertise are renewable electricity renewable fuels integrated energy systems and strategic energy analysis in 2011 nrel became the co-secretariat of the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp alongside the climate development knowledge network cdkn funding in 2009 and 2010 the fy 2010 congressional appropriations for renewable energy items were solar energy 79.7 million wind energy 38.8 million biomass and biorefinery systems rd 38.3 million hydrogen technology 16.4 million geothermal technology 4.8 million water power 4.2 million for 2009 funding was broken down between its major groups wind 33.9 million biofuels 35.4 million solar 72.4 million commercialization and technology transfer nrel works closely with a number of private partners to transfer technological developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the marketplace and social arena nrels innovative technologies have been recognized with 57 rd 100 awards the engineering and science behind these technology transfer successes and awards demonstrates nrels commitment to a sustainable energy future the idea of technology transfer was added to the mission of nrel as a means of enhancing commercial impact and societal benefit ultimately justifying the use of tax dollars to in part fund the projects in the lab as many of these technologies are young and often just emerging nrel aims to reduce the risk of private sector investment and adoption of their developments three key pieces of federal legislation laid the policy framework to enact technology transfer the stevenson-wydler technology innovation act of 1980 the bayh-dole act or the university and small business patent procedures act of 1980 and the federal technology transfer act of 1986 ultimately many of the deployed technologies help mitigate the oil dependence of the united states reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and maintain u.s industry competitiveness deployment of technologies is accomplished by developing technology partnerships with private industry nrel serves as a reduced-risk platform for research and through partnerships those advances can effectively be translated into serving the interest of both the private sector and the public sector the energy goals set by the doe are at the forefront of the research done in the laboratory and the research reflects the energy goals which are designed with the interest of u.s industry competitiveness in mind the challenge to achieving these goals is investment security part of the technology transfer process is to form partnerships that not only focus on financial security but also to consider partners who have demonstrated core values that reflect the integrity to manage the introduction and assimilation of the technological developments nrel focuses on the core values of the partnering entity the willingness to set and meet timely goals dedication to transparency and a reciprocating intent to further development under these partnership agreements nrel does not fund projects conducted by their private partners nrel does provide funding opportunities through their competitively placed contracts in order to form a technology partnership agreement with nrel there are essentially 11 steps discuss the project proposal with the appropriate nrel technical contact determine if the project meets qualifications separate checklist of criteria determine agreement type cooperative research and development agreements cradas work for others develop statement of work provide draft agreement review andor negotiate sign agreement review and approve send funds start work manage commitment the process is estimated to require 45 business days subject to negotiations technology partnership agreements provide only the technical services of nrel moving further than technology partnership agreements are licensing agreements and nondisclosure agreements licensing agreements provide industry to market and commercialize technology developed by nrel this type of agreement is available to any organization regardless of size a nondisclosure agreement is an agreement to implement confidentiality of information for a mutually beneficial collaboration in research and development prior successes include the nrel and skyfuel partnership in the next generation of solar parabolic troughs and also the partnership between nrel scientists ampulse corporation and oak ridge national laboratory ornl to create a less expensive alternative to wafer crystalline silicon solar cells cooperative research and development agreement a cooperative research and development agreement crada is a partnership between nrel and an outside company this type of agreement protects the intellectual property of both nrel and the outside company and allows the investing company the right to exclusive field-of-use license for any inventions that come out of the crada there are two types of cradas a shared-resource crada is used to develop advance or commercialize an nrel project without money changing hands the development and progress of a shared-resource crada must fit within the scope of an existing nrel project already funded by the doe the second type of agreement is called a funds-in crada it allows for the partner to pay for some or all of nrel expenses under a project but nrel does not supply funds to the partner a specific example of a cooperative research and development agreement crada is between nrel oak ridge national laboratory ornl and the ampulse corporation to develop a less expensive silicon solar cell funding came from both parties and the resulting processes and investigations were carried out in cooperation between the three entities two federal and one non-federal work for others nrel offers technical services to partners who require resources that are not available to them through the form of a work-for-others agreement this agreement differs from cradas in that they are not for the purpose of performing joint research the partner covers the entire cost of the project there are four types of work-for-others agreements interagency agreement-government iag a partnership formed between the doe and a second u.s federal agency the outside agency funds the project directly funds-in agreement fia a non-federal entity funds the project and research conducted by nrel in some occasions the partner can obtain title to inventions technical services agreement tsa a non-federal entity pays nrel for services related to an analytical problem nrel provides consultation and basic technical assistance analytical services agreement asa this is a narrower more specified version of a technical services agreement non-federal sponsors pay for a specific analytical service performed by the lab in one of 13 different categories of testingcharacterization services it is a small-scale agreement often dubbed a shrink-wrap agreement has a maximum duration of 3 months and a maximum value of 25,000 technology licensing nrel offers licensing for many of its technologies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy development licensing of nrels
