used in favour of capitalism stating a number of great factories in the hands of rich capitalists in which slaves of work drag out their miserable existence is not therefore the goal of the development of the age of natural science but a return to individual labour or where the nature of things demands it the carrying on of common workshops by unions of workmen who will receive a sound basis only through the general extension of knowledge and civilization and through the possibility of obtaining cheaper capital he also rejected the claim that science lead to materialism stating instead equally unfounded is the complaint that the study of science and the technical application of the forces of nature gives to mankind a thoroughly material direction makes them proud of their knowledge and power and alienates ideal endeavours the deeper we penetrate into the harmonious action of natural forces regulated by eternal unalterable laws and yet so thickly veiled from our complete comprehension the more we feel on the contrary moved to humble modesty the smaller appears to us the extent of our knowledge the more active is our endeavour to draw more from the inexhaustible fountain of knowledge and understanding and the higher rises our admiration of the endless wisdom which ordains and penetrates the whole creation patents u.s patent 322,859 — electric
