function mftempopensectionidvar blockdocument.getelementbyidmf-section-idblock.classname open-blockblock.previoussibling.classname open-blocknitrogen oxide may refer to a binary compound of oxygen and nitrogen or a mixture of such compounds nitric oxide also known as nitrogen monoxide no nitrogenii oxide nitrogen dioxide no2 nitrogeniv oxide nitrous oxide n2o nitrogen−i,iii oxide nitrosylazide n4o nitrogen−i,0,i,ii oxide oxatetrazole n4o dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 nitrogenii,iv oxide dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 nitrogeniv oxide dinitrogen pentoxide n2o5 nitrogenv oxide trinitramide nno23 or n4o6 nitrogen0,iv oxide nitrite no− 2 nitrate no− 3 nitronium no 2 nitrosonium no peroxonitrite ono− 2 the compounds no and no2 are radicals in addition there are several anions of nitrogen oxides the most stable of these is the nitrate anion nitrate no3 trioxonitratev ion but other nitrogen oxoanions include nitrite peroxonitrite trioxodinitrate hyponitrate and nitroxylate in atmospheric chemistry air pollution and related fields nitrogen oxides refers specifically to nox no and no2 only the first three of these compounds can be isolated at room temperature n2o3 n2o4 and n2o5 all decompose rapidly at room temperature no3 n4o and nno23 are very reactive n2o is stable and rather unreactive at room temperature while no and no2 are quite reactive but nevertheless quite stable when isolated nitric oxide no nitrogen dioxide no2 nitrous oxide n2o dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 dinitrogen pentoxide n2o5 trinitramide nno23 nox main article nox nox often written nox refers to no and no2 they are produced during combustion especially at high temperature these two chemicals are important trace species in earths atmosphere in the troposphere during daylight no reacts with partly oxidised organic species or the peroxy radical to form no2 which is then photolysed by sunlight to reform no the oxygen atom formed in the second reaction then goes on to form ozone this series of reactions is the main source of tropospheric ozone ch3o2 is just one example of many partly oxidised organic molecules that can react with no to form no2 these reactions are rather fast so no and no2 tend to cycle but the sum of their concentration no no2 tends to remain fairly constant because of this cycling it is convenient to think of the two chemicals as a group hence the term nox in addition to acting as a main precursor for tropospheric ozone nox is also harmful to human health in its own right nox may react with water to make nitric acid which may end up in the soil where it makes nitrate which is of use to growing plants derivatives see also birkeland–eyde process oxidized cationic and reduced anionic derivatives of many of these oxides exist nitrite no− 2 templatenitrogen oxide nitronium no 2 and nitrosonium no no2 is intermediate between nitrite and nitronium see also nitrogen oxide sensor sulfur nitrides which are valence isoelectronic with nitrogen oxides
