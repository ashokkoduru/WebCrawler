the density of air greek rho air density is the mass per unit volume of earths atmosphere air density like air pressure decreases with increasing altitude it also changes with variation in temperature or humidity at sea level and at 15 °c air has a density of approximately 1.225 kgm 0.001225 gcm 0.0023769 slugft 0.0765 lbmft according to isa international standard atmosphere the air density is a property used in many branches of science as aeronautics gravimetric analysis the air-conditioning industry atmospheric research and meteorology the agricultural engineering in their modeling and tracking of soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer svat models and the engineering community that deals with compressed air from industry utility heating drying and cooling processes in industries like cooling towers vacuum and deep vacuum processes high pressure processes gas and light oil combustion processes that power turbine-powered airplanes gas turbine-powered generators and heating furnaces and air conditioning from deep mines to space capsules density of air calculations depending on the measuring instruments use area of expertise and necessary rigor of the result different calculation criteria and sets of equations for the calculation of the density of air are used this topic are some examples of calculations with the main variables involved the amounts presented throughout these examples are properly referenced usual values different values can be found in other references depending on the criteria used for the calculation  furthermore we must pay attention to the fact that air is a mixture of gases and the calculation always simplify to a greater or lesser extent the properties of the mixture and the values for the composition according to the criteria of calculation density of air variables temperature and pressure the density of dry air can be calculated using the ideal gas law expressed as a function of temperature and pressure where the specific gas constant for dry air is 287.058 jkg·k in si units and 53.35 ft·lbflbm·°r in united states customary and imperial units this quantity may vary slightly depending on the molecular composition of air at a particular location therefore at iupac standard temperature and pressure 0 °c and 100 kpa dry air has a density of 1.2754 kgm at 20 °c and 101.325 kpa dry air has a density of 1.2041 kgm at 70 °f and 14.696 psi dry air has a density of 0.074887lbmft the following table illustrates the air density–temperature relationship at 1 atm or 101.325 kpa humidity water vapor main article humidity the addition of water vapor to air making the air humid reduces the density of the air which may at first appear counter-intuitive this occurs because the molar mass of water 18 gmol is less than the molar mass of dry air around 29 gmol for any gas at a given temperature and pressure the number of molecules present is constant for a particular volume see avogadros law so when water molecules water vapor are added to a given volume of air the dry air molecules must decrease by the same number to keep the pressure or temperature from increasing hence the mass per unit volume of the gas its density decreases the density of humid air may be calculated as a mixture of ideal gases in this case the partial pressure of water vapor is known as the vapor pressure using this method error in the density calculation is less than 0.2 in the range of −10 °c to 50 °c the density of humid air is found by where the vapor pressure of water may be calculated from the saturation vapor pressure and relative humidity it is found by where the saturation vapor pressure of water at any given temperature is the vapor pressure when relative humidity is 100 one formula used to find the saturation vapor pressure is where t displaystyle t is in degrees c the partial pressure of dry air p d displaystyle pd is found considering partial pressure resulting in where p displaystyle p simply denotes the observed absolute pressure altitude to calculate the density of air as a function of altitude one requires additional parameters they are listed below along with their values according to the international standard atmosphere using for calculation the universal gas constant instead of the air specific constant temperature at altitude h displaystyle h meters above sea level is approximated by the following formula only valid inside the troposphere the pressure at altitude h displaystyle h is given by density can then be calculated according to a molar form of the ideal gas law where composition the air composition adopted for each set of equations varies with the references used in the table below are listed some examples of air composition according to the references despite minor differences to define all formulations the predicted molar mass of dry air and below table shows these differences importantly some of the examples are not normalized so that the composition is equal to unity 100 before they used should be normalized see also air density atmosphere of earth international standard atmosphere u.s standard atmosphere nrlmsise-00 notes external links conversions
