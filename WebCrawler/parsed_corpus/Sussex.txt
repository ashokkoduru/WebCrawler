landscape the physical geography of sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the wealden anticline the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction the weald itself and the south downs natural england has identified the following seven national character areas in sussex south coast plain south downs wealden greensand low weald high weald pevensey levels romney marshes at 280m blackdown is the highest point in sussex or county top ditchling beacon 248m is the highest point in east sussex at 113 kilometres 70 miles long the river

is bewl water on the kent border while the largest wholly within sussex is ardingly reservoir climate the coastal resorts of sussex and neighbouring hampshire are the sunniest places in the united kingdom the coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas sea breezes blowing off the sea tend to clear any cloud from the coast most of sussex lies in hardiness zone 8 the exception is the coastal plain west of brighton which lies in the milder zone 9 rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the south downs with 950 mm 37 in of rainfall per year the close proximity of sussex to the continent of europe results in cold spells in winter and hot humid weather in summer the climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea which because of its tendency to warm up slower than land can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer in the autumn months the coast sometimes has higher temperatures rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers from january to march the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems in winter the east winds can be as cold as further inland selsey is known as a tornado hotspot with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986 1998 and 2000 with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1,000 buildings the sunshine

found that the population was 159,311 the decline of the sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase of population during several centuries although after the massacre of st bartholomew upwards of 1,500 huguenots landed at rye and in 1685 after the revocation of the edict of nantes many more refugees were added to the county the area of the ancient county is 933,887 acres 377,931 ha

remains in europe dating back some 500,000 years and known as boxgrove man or homo heidelbergensis at a site near pulborough called the beedings tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last neanderthals in northern europe or pioneer populations of modern humans the thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses bison mammoth and woolly rhinos around 6000bc the ice sheet over the north sea melted sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards creating the english channel and cutting the people of sussex off from their mesolithic kinsmen to the south later in the neolithic period the area of the south downs above worthing was one of britains largest and most important flint-mining centres the flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture the oldest of these mines at church hill in findon has been carbon-dated to 4500bc to 3750bc making it one of the earliest known mines in britain flint tools from cissbury have been found as far away as the eastern mediterranean sussex is rich in remains from the bronze and iron ages in particular the bronze age barrows known as the devils jumps and cissbury ring one of britains largest hillforts towards the end of the iron age in 75bc people from the atrebates one of the tribes of the belgae a mix of celtic and german stock started invading and occupying southern britain this was followed by an invasion by the roman army under julius caesar that temporarily occupied the south-east in 55bc soon after the first roman invasion had ended the celtic regnenses tribe under their leader commius occupied the manhood peninsula tincomarus and then cogidubnus followed commius as rulers of the regnenses roman canton at the time of the roman conquest in ad43 there was an oppidum in the southern part of their territory probably in the selsey region a number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the roman invasion of britain in ad43 started around fishbourne and chichester harbour rather than the traditional landing place of richborough in kent according to this theory the romans were called to restore the refugee verica king of the atrebates who had been driven out by the catuvellauni a tribe based around modern hertfordshire sussex was home to the magnificent roman palace at fishbourne by far the largest roman residence known north of the alps much of sussex was a roman canton of the regnenses or regni with its capital at noviomagus reginorum modern-day chichester the romans built villas especially on the coastal plain and around chichester one of the best preserved being that at bignor christianity first came to sussex at this time but faded away when the romans left in the 5th

from britain around 410 ad saxon kingdom main article kingdom of sussex the foundation legend of sussex is provided by the anglo-saxon chronicle which states that in the year ad 477 Ælle landed with his three sons having fought on the banks of the mearcredesburna it seems aelle secured the area between the ouse and cuckmere in a treaty after aelle’s forces seized the saxon shore fort of anderida the south saxons were able to gradually colonise free of romano-british control and extend their territory westwards to link with the saxon settlement at highdown hill aelle was recognised as the first bretwalda or overlord of southern britain he was probably the most senior of the anglo-saxon kings and led the ill-fated campaign against king arthur at mount badon by the end of the 7th century the region around selsey and chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom in the 660s-670s king aethelwealh of sussex formed an alliance with the mercian king wulfhere and together they took the isle of wight from the west saxons probably at the battle of biedanheafele as mercias first christian king wulfhere insisted that Æthelwealh also convert to christianity Æthelwealh was baptised in mercia with wulfhere as his sponsor wulfhere gave the isle of wight and meon valley to aethelwealh with wulfhere acting as overlord the alliance with mercia was sealed with Æthelwealh taking the hand of eabe a mercian princess in marriage wilfrid the exiled bishop of york came to sussex in 681 and with king Æthelwealhs approval set up a mission to convert the people of sussex to christianity Æthelwealh gave wilfrid land on the manhood peninsula close to his own royal estate and wilfrid founded selsey abbey the mission was jeopardised when king Æthelwealh was killed by cædwalla a prince of wessex cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealhs grant of land and wilfrid built his selsey abbey cædwalla was driven out by the south saxon nobles berthun and andhun the south saxons fought off the west saxons in 722 and again in 725 at the end of the 8th century ealdwulf was perhaps the last independent king of sussex after which sussex and other southern kingdoms came increasingly under mercian rule mercias grip was shattered in 825 at the battle of ellendun after which sussex and the other southern kingdoms came under the control of wessex which later grew into the kingdom of england norman sussex sussex was the venue for the momentous battle of hastings the decisive victory in the norman conquest of england in september 1066 william of normandy landed with his forces at pevensey and erected a wooden castle at hastings from which they raided the surrounding area the battle was fought between duke william of normandy and the english king harold godwinson who had strong connections with sussex and whose chief seat was probably in bosham after having marched his exhausted army all the way from yorkshire harold fought the normans at the battle of hastings where englands army was defeated and harold was killed it is likely that all the fighting men of sussex were at the battle as the countys thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated william built battle abbey at the site of the battle with the exact spot where harold fell marked by the high altar sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any english county under the normans for it was the heartland of king harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion the county was of great importance to the normans hastings and pevensey being on the most direct route for normandy the countys existing sub-divisions known as rapes were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of williams most trusted barons castles were built to defend the territories including at arundel bramber lewes pevensey and hastings sussexs bishop Æthelric ii was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with and william the conquerors personal chaplain stigand the normans also built chichester cathedral and moved the seat of sussexs bishopric from selsey to chichester the normans also founded new towns in sussex including new shoreham the centre of modern shoreham-by-sea battle arundel uckfield and winchelsea in 1264 the sussex downs were the location of the battle of lewes in which simon de montfort and his fellow barons captured prince edward later

provisional administration was set up consisting of montfort the bishop of chichester and the earl of gloucester these three were to elect a council of nine to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached sussex under the plantagenets during the hundred years war sussex found itself on the frontline convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed french pirates hastings rye and winchelsea were all burnt during this period and all three towns became part of the cinque ports a loose federation for supplying ships for the countrys security also at this time amberley and bodiam castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers early modern sussex like the rest of the country the church of englands split with rome during the reign of

agricultural labourers conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed those in work faced their wages being forced down conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the house of lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers seasonal workers had been found dead of starvation the deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots first in neighbouring kent and then in sussex where they lasted for several weeks although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the swing riots railways spread across sussex in the 19th century and county councils were created for sussexs eastern and western divisions in 1889 during world war i on the eve of the battle of the somme on 30 june 1916 the royal sussex

and is often broken up into to small irregular fields and woods by the topography making it unsuitable for intensive arable farming in these areas pastoral or mixed farming has always been the pattern with field boundaries often little changed since the medieval period sussex cattle are the descendants of the draught oxen which continued to be used in the weald longer than in other parts of england the chalk downlands were traditionally grazed by large numbers of small southdown sheep suited to the low fertility of the pasture until the coming of artificial fertiliser made cereal growing
