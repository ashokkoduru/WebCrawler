function mftempopensectionidvar blockdocument.getelementbyidmf-section-idblock.classname open-blockblock.previoussibling.classname open-block pesticides are substances meant for attracting seducing and then destroying any pest they are a class of biocide the most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products also known as crop protection products which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds fungi or insects this use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product although it is in fact a broader term as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes the term pesticide includes all of the following herbicide insecticide insect growth regulator nematicide termiticide molluscicide piscicide avicide rodenticide predacide bactericide insect repellent animal repellent antimicrobial fungicide disinfectant antimicrobial and sanitizer in general a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent such as a virus bacterium antimicrobial or disinfectant that deters incapacitates kills or otherwise discourages pests target pests can include insects plant pathogens weeds mollusks birds mammals fish nematodes roundworms and microbes that destroy property cause nuisance or spread disease or are disease vectors although pesticides have benefits some also have drawbacks such as potential toxicity to humans and other species according to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are organochlorine pesticides definition the food and agriculture organization fao has defined pesticide as pesticides can be classified by target organism e.g herbicides insecticides fungicides rodenticides and pediculicides  see table chemical structure e.g organic inorganic synthetic or biological biopesticide although the distinction can sometimes blur and physical state e.g gaseous fumigant biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides plant-derived pesticides or botanicals have been developing quickly these include the pyrethroids rotenoids nicotinoids and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families prominent insecticide families include organochlorines organophosphates and carbamates organochlorine hydrocarbons e.g ddt could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes cyclodiene compounds and other related compounds they operate by disrupting the sodiumpotassium balance of the nerve fiber forcing the nerve to transmit continuously their toxicities vary greatly but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides e.g 2,4-d triazines e.g atrazine ureas e.g diuron and chloroacetanilides e.g alachlor phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses the phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones and grow cells without normal cell division crushing the plants nutrient transport system triazines interfere with photosynthesis many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families including glyphosate pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method most pesticides work by poisoning pests a systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant with insecticides and most fungicides this movement is usually upward through the xylem and outward increased efficiency may be a result systemic insecticides which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers may kill bees and other needed pollinators in 2009 the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced these work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins which fungi then detoxify using enzymes the paldoxins inhibit the fungis detoxification enzymes they are believed to be safer and greener uses pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful for example they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like west nile virus yellow fever and malaria they can also kill bees wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds trees and brush they can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the united states environmental protection agency epa and the pest management regulatory agency pmra of canada ddt sprayed on the walls of houses is an organochlorine that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s recent policy statements by the world health organization have given stronger support to this approach however ddt and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity ddt use is not always effective as resistance to ddt was identified in africa as early as 1955 and by 1972 nineteen species of mosquito worldwide were resistant to ddt amount used in 2006 and 2007 the world used approximately 2.4 megatonnes 5.3×10 lb of pesticides with herbicides constituting the biggest part of the world pesticide use at 40 followed by insecticides 17 and fungicides 10 in 2006 and 2007 the u.s used approximately 0.5 megatonnes 1.1×10 lb of pesticides accounting for 22 of the world total including 857 million pounds 389 kt of conventional pesticides which are used in the agricultural sector 80 of conventional pesticide use as well as the industrial commercial governmental and home garden sectors.pesticides are also found in majority of u.s households with 78 million out of the 105.5 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide as of 2007 there were more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides which yield over 20,000 pesticide products that are marketed in the united states the us used some 1 kg 2.2 pounds per hectare of arable land compared with 4.7 kg in china 1.3 kg in the uk 0.1 kg in cameroon 5.9 kg in japan and 2.5 kg in italy insecticide use in the us has declined by more than half since 1980 6yr mostly due to the near phase-out of organophosphates in corn fields the decline was even steeper due to the switchover to transgenic bt corn for the global market of crop protection products market analysts forecast revenues of over 52 billion us in 2019 benefits pesticides can save farmers money by preventing crop losses to insects and other pests in the u.s farmers get an estimated fourfold return on money they spend on pesticides one study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10 another study conducted in 1999 found that a ban on pesticides in the united states may result in a rise of food prices loss of jobs and an increase in world hunger there are two levels of benefits for pesticide use primary and secondary primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term primary benefits controlling pests and plant disease vectors improved croplivestock yields improved croplivestock quality invasive species controlled controlling humanlivestock disease vectors and nuisance organisms human lives saved and suffering reduced animal lives saved and suffering reduced diseases contained geographically controlling organisms that harm other human activities and structures drivers view unobstructed treebrushleaf hazards prevented wooden structures protected monetary every dollar 1 that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars 4 in crops saved this means based that on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides 10 billion there is an additional 40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds in general farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round the general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses such as malaria the use of pesticides creates a large job market within the agrichemical sector costs on the cost side of pesticide use there can be costs to the environment costs to human health as well as costs of the development and research of new pesticides health effects main articles health effects of pesticides and pesticide poisoning pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in people who are exposed pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects ranging from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems and also causing cancer a 2007 systematic review found that most studies on non-hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased there is substantial evidence of associations between organophosphate insecticide exposures and neurobehavioral alterations limited evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological birth defects and fetal death the american academy of pediatrics recommends limiting exposure of children to pesticides and using safer alternatives the world health organization and the un environment programme estimate that each year 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides about 18,000 of whom die owing to inadequate regulation and safety precautions 99 of pesticide related deaths occur in developing countries that account for only 25 of pesticide usage according to one study as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly there are several careers aside from agriculture that may also put individuals at risk of health effects from pesticide exposure including pet groomers groundskeepers and fumigators one study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide and recommended among other things more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans a 2014 epidemiological review found associations between autism and exposure to certain pesticides but noted that the available evidence was insufficient to conclude that the relationship was causal environmental effect main article environmental effects of pesticides pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns over 98 of sprayed insecticides and 95 of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species including non-target species air water and soil pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas potentially contaminating them pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination in addition pesticide use reduces biodiversity contributes to pollinator decline destroys habitat especially for birds and threatens endangered species pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide pesticide resistance necessitating a new pesticide alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides dissolve in fats and are not excreted organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely biological magnification is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons pesticides are more concentrated at each level of the food chain among marine animals pesticide concentrations are higher in carnivorous fishes and even more so in the fish-eating birds and mammals at the top of the ecological pyramid global distillation is the process whereby pesticides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the earth in particular the poles and mountain tops pesticides that evaporate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances thousands of kilometers by the wind to an area of lower temperature where they condense and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow in order to reduce negative impacts it is desirable that pesticides be degradable or at least quickly deactivated in the environment such loss of activity or toxicity of pesticides is due to both innate chemical properties of the compounds and environmental processes or conditions for example the presence of halogens within a chemical structure often slows down degradation in an aerobic environment adsorption to soil may retard pesticide movement but also may reduce bioavailability to microbial degraders economics human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the united states is estimated at 9.6 billion offset by about 40 billion in increased agricultural production additional costs include the registration process and the cost of purchasing pesticides the registration process can take several years to complete there are 70 different types of field test and can cost 50–70 million for a single pesticide annually the united states spends 10 billion on pesticides alternatives alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation use of biological pest controls such as pheromones and microbial pesticides genetic engineering and methods of interfering with insect breeding application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests these methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides in addition epa is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers cultivation practices include polyculture growing multiple types of plants crop rotation planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop in the u.s farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use these organisms can include natural predators or parasites of the pests biological pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi bacteria and viruses cause disease in the pest species can also be used interfering with insects reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring this technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly the tsetse fly and the gypsy moth however this can be a costly time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects agroecology emphasize nutrient recycling use of locally available and renewable resources adaptation to local conditions utilization of microenvironments reliance on indigenous knowledge and yield maximization while maintaining soil productivity agroecology also emphasizes empowering people and local communities to contribute to development and encouraging “multi-directional” communications rather than the conventional “top-down” method push pull strategy main article push–pull technology the term push-pull was established in 1987 as an approach for integrated pest management ipm this strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects push means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected pull means that certain stimuli semiochemical stimuli pheromones food additives visual stimuli genetically altered plants etc are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed there are numerous different components involved in order to implement a push-pull strategy in ipm many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world the most successful push-pull strategy was developed in africa for subsistence farming another successful case study was performed on the control of helicoverpa in cotton crops in australia in europe the middle east and the united states push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of sitona lineatus in bean fields some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable furthermore because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of ipm operational and registration costs are higher effectiveness some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals for example sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops in indonesia farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65 and experienced a 15 crop increase a study of maize fields in northern florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield with yield increases ranging from 10 to 212 the observed effects were long-term often not appearing until the third season of the study however pesticide resistance is increasing in the 1940s u.s farmers lost only 7 of their crops to pests since the 1980s loss has increased to 13 even though more pesticides are being used between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945 types pesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds or persistent pesticides which may take months or years before they are broken down it was the persistence of ddt for example which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides or are derived from a common source or production method some examples of chemically-related pesticides are organophosphate pesticides organophosphates affect the nervous system by disrupting acetylcholinesterase activity the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine a neurotransmitter most organophosphates are insecticides they were developed during the early 19th century but their effects on insects which are similar to their effects on humans were discovered in 1932 some are very poisonous however they usually are not persistent in the environment carbamate pesticides carbamate pesticides affect the nervous system by disrupting an enzyme that regulates acetylcholine a neurotransmitter the enzyme effects are usually reversible there are several subgroups within the carbamates organochlorine insecticides they were commonly used in the past but many have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence e.g ddt chlordane and toxaphene pyrethroid pesticides they were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin which is found in chrysanthemums they have been modified to increase their stability in the environment some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system sulfonylurea herbicides the following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control amidosulfuron azimsulfuron bensulfuron-methyl chlorimuron-ethyl ethoxysulfuron flazasulfuron flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium halosulfuron-methyl imazosulfuron nicosulfuron oxasulfuron primisulfuron-methyl pyrazosulfuron-ethyl rimsulfuron sulfometuron-methyl sulfosulfuron terbacil bispyribac-sodium cyclosulfamuron and pyrithiobac-sodium nicosulfuron triflusulfuron methyl and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase in the 1960s more than 1 kgha 0.89 lbacre crop protection chemical was typically applied while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1 as much material to achieve the same effect biopesticides main article biopesticide biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals plants bacteria and certain minerals for example canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides biopesticides fall into three major classes microbial pesticides which consist of bacteria entomopathogenic fungi or viruses and sometimes includes the metabolites that bacteria or fungi produce entomopathogenic nematodes are also often classed as microbial pesticides even though they are multi-cellular biochemical pesticides or herbal pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control or monitor in the case of pheromones pests and microbial diseases plant-incorporated protectants pips have genetic material from other species incorporated into their genetic material i.e gm crops their use is controversial especially in many european countries classified by type of pest pesticides that are related to the type of pests are further types of pesticides the term pesticide also include these substances defoliants  cause leaves or other foliage to drop from a plant usually to facilitate harvest desiccants  promote drying of living tissues such as unwanted plant tops insect growth regulators  disrupt the molting maturity from pupal stage to adult or other life processes of insects plant growth regulators  substances excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients that alter the expected growth flowering or reproduction rate of plants regulation international in most countries pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency in europe recent eu legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are carcinogenic mutagenic or toxic to reproduction those that are endocrine-disrupting and those that are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt or very persistent and very bioaccumulative vpvb measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all eu member states though pesticide regulations differ from country to country pesticides and products on which they were used are traded across international borders to deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries delegates to a conference of the united nations food and agriculture organization adopted an international code of conduct on the distribution and use of pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries the code was updated in 1998 and 2002 the fao claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the united nations london guidelines for the exchange of information on chemicals in international trade and the united nations codex alimentarius commission the former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse but do not eliminate all misuse reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use integrated pest management the use of multiple approaches to control pests is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as indonesia china bangladesh the u.s australia and mexico ipm attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem so that natural balances are not upset new pesticides are being developed including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks in addition applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pests lifecycle which can be environmentally more friendly for example potato cyst nematodes emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop a similar chemical can be applied to fields early before the potatoes are planted causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes united states main article pesticide regulation in the united states in the united states the environmental protection agency epa is responsible for regulating pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and the food quality protection act fqpa studies must be conducted to establish the conditions in which the material is safe to use and the effectiveness against the intended pests the epa regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment pesticides produced before november 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards all registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards during the registration process a label is created the label contains directions for proper use of the material in addition to safety restrictions based on acute toxicity pesticides are assigned to a toxicity class some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated restricted use pesticides only certified applicators who have passed an exam may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations these records must be made available to employees and state or territorial environmental regulatory agencies the epa regulates pesticides under two main acts both of which amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 in addition to the epa the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops the epa looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide in addition the u.s epa uses the national research councils four-step process for human health risk assessment 1 hazard identification 2 dose-response assessment 3 exposure assessment and 4 risk characterization recently kauai county hawaii passed bill no 2491 to add an article to chapter 22 of the countys code relating to pesticides and gmos the bill strengthens protections of local communities in kauai where many large pesticide companies test their products history since before 2000 bc humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops the first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient mesopotamia the rig veda which is about 4,000 years old mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control by the 15th century toxic chemicals such as arsenic mercury and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests in the 17th century nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide the 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides pyrethrum which is derived from chrysanthemums and rotenone which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables until the 1950s arsenic-based pesticides were dominant paul müller discovered that ddt was a very effective insecticide organochlorines such as ddt were dominant but they were replaced in the u.s by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975 since then pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide herbicides became common in the 1960s led by triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and glyphosate the first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910 however decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the pesticide era although the u.s environmental protection agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972 pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes 2.5 million short tons of industrial pesticides are now used each year seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries but use in developing countries is increasing a study of usa pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the national science foundations center for integrated pest management in the 1960s it was discovered that ddt was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing which was a serious threat to biodiversity rachel carson wrote the best-selling book silent spring about biological magnification the agricultural use of ddt is now banned under the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent malaria and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes see also agriculture and agronomy
