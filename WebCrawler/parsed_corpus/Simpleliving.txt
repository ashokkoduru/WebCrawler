they are tasty incredibly nutritious and easy to grow we grow them in wide mouthed mason jars with a square of nylon window screen screwed under a metal ring farmer matt moore spoke on this issue how does it affect the consumer to know that broccoli takes 105 days to grow a head  the supermarket mode is one of plenty — its always stocked and that changes our sense of time how long it takes to grow food — thats removed in the marketplace they dont want you to think about how long it takes to grow because they want you to buy right now one way to change this viewpoint is also suggested by mr moore he placed a video installation in the produce section of a grocery store that documented the length of time it took to grow certain vegetables this aimed to raise awareness in people of the length of time actually needed for gardens the do it yourself ethic refers to the principle of undertaking necessary tasks oneself rather than having others who are more skilled or experienced complete them for you reconsidering technology people who practice simple living have diverse views on the role of technology the american political activist scott nearing was skeptical about how humanity would use new technology citing destructive inventions such as nuclear weapons those who eschew all technology are often referred to as luddites or neo-luddites although simple living is often a secular pursuit it may still involve reconsidering personal definitions of appropriate technology as anabaptist groups such as the amish or mennonites have done technological proponents see cutting-edge technologies as a way to make a simple lifestyle within mainstream culture easier and more sustainable they argue that the internet can reduce an individuals carbon footprint through telecommuting and paper usage some have also calculated their energy consumption and have shown that one can live simply and in an emotionally satisfying way by using much less energy than is used in western countries technologies they may embrace include computers photovoltaic arrays wind and water turbines technological interventions that appear to simplify living may actually induce side effects elsewhere or at a future point in time evgeny morozov warns that tools like the internet can facilitate mass surveillance and political repression the book green illusions identifies how wind and solar energy technologies have hidden side effects and can actually increase energy consumption and entrench environmental harms over time authors of the book techno-fix criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural problems advertising is criticised for encouraging a consumerist mentality many advocates of simple living tend to agree

the earth politics and activism environmentalism simple living may be undertaken by environmentalists for example green parties often advocate simple living as a consequence of their four pillars or the ten key values of the green party of the united states this includes in policy terms their rejection of genetic modification and nuclear power and other technologies they consider to be hazardous the greens support for simplicity is based on the reduction in natural resource usage and environmental impact this concept is expressed in ernest callenbachs green triangle of ecology frugality and health many with similar views avoid involvement even with green politics as compromising simplicity however and advocate forms of green anarchism that attempt to implement these principles at a smaller scale e.g the ecovillage deep ecology a belief that the world does not exist as a resource to be freely exploited by humans proposes wilderness preservation human population control and simple living anti-war the alleged relationship between economic growth and war when fought for control and exploitation of natural and human resources is considered a good reason for promoting a simple living lifestyle avoiding the perpetuation of the resource curse is a similar objective of many simple living adherents opposition to war has led peace activists such as ammon hennacy and ellen thomas to a form of tax resistance in which they reduce their income below the tax threshold by taking up a simple living lifestyle these individuals believe that their government is engaged in immoral unethical or destructive activities such as war and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities art the term bohemianism has been used to describe a long tradition of both voluntary and involuntary poverty by artists who devote their time to artistic endeavors rather than paid labor in may 2014 a story on npr suggested that positive attitudes towards living in poverty for the sake of art are

ramen noodles economics a new economics movement has been building since the un conference on the environment in 1972 and the publication that year of only one earth the limits to growth and blueprint for survival followed in 1973 by small is beautiful economics as if people mattered recently david wann has introduced the idea of “simple prosperity” as it applies to a sustainable lifestyle from his point of view and as a point of departure for what he calls real sustainability “it is important to ask ourselves three fundamental questions what is the point of all our commuting and consuming what is the economy for and finally why do we seem to be unhappier now than when we began our initial pursuit for rich abundance” in this context simple living is the opposite of our modern quest for affluence and as a result it becomes less preoccupied with quantity and more concerned about the preservation of cities traditions and nature a reference point for this new economics can be found in james robertsons a new economics of sustainable development and the work of thinkers and activists who participate in his working for a sane alternative network and program according to robertson the shift to sustainability is likely to require a widespread shift of emphasis from raising incomes to reducing costs the principles of the new economics as set out by robertson are the following systematic empowerment of people as opposed to making and keeping them dependent as the basis for people-centred development systematic conservation of resources and the environment as the basis for environmentally sustainable development evolution from a “wealth of nations” model of economic life to a one-world model and from todays inter-national economy to an ecologically sustainable decentralising multi-level one-world economic system restoration of political and ethical factors to a central place in economic life and thought respect for qualitative values not just quantitative
