for international co-operation can be traced back to the league of nations resolution on 21 september 1921 to elect a commission to study feasibility on 18 december 1925 the international bureau of education ibe began work as a non-governmental organization in the service of international educational development however the work of these predecessor organizations was largely interrupted by the onset of world war ii after the signing of the atlantic charter and the declaration of the united nations the conference of allied ministers of education came began meetings in london which continued between 16 november 1942 to 5 december 1945 on 30 october 1943 the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the moscow declaration agreed upon by china the united kingdom the united states and the ussr this was followed by the dumbarton oaks conference proposals of 9 october 1944 upon the proposal of came and in accordance with the recommendations of the united nations conference on international organization uncio held in san francisco in april–june 1945 a united nations conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization ecoconf was convened in london 1–16 november 1945 with 44 governments represented a prominent figure in the initiative for unesco was rab butler the minister of education for the united kingdom at the ecoconf the constitution of unesco was introduced and signed by 37 countries and a preparatory commission was established the preparatory commission operated between 16 november 1945 and 4 november 1946—the date when unescos constitution came into force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state the first general conference took place from 19 november to 10 december 1946 and elected dr julian huxley to the post of director-general the constitution was amended in november 1954 when the general conference resolved that members of the executive board would be representatives of the governments of the states of which they are nationals and would not as before act in their personal capacity this change in governance distinguished unesco from its predecessor the cici in terms of how member states would work together in the organizations fields of competence as member states worked together over time to realize unescos mandate political and historical factors have shaped the organizations operations in particular during the cold war the decolonization process and the dissolution of the ussr among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism for example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration of anthropologists among them was claude lévi-strauss and other scientists in 1950 and concluding with the 1978 declaration on race and racial prejudice in 1956 the republic of south africa withdrew from unesco claiming that some of the organizations publications amounted to interference in the countrys racial problems south africa rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership of nelson mandela unescos early work in the field of education included the pilot project on fundamental education in the marbial valley haiti started in 1947 this project was followed by expert missions to other countries including for example a mission to afghanistan in 1949 in 1948 unesco recommended that member states should make free primary education compulsory and universal in 1990 the world conference on education for all in jomtien thailand launched a global movement to provide basic education for all children youths and adults ten years later the 2000 world education forum held in dakar senegal led member governments to commit to achieving basic education for all by 2015 unescos early activities in the field of culture included for example the nubia campaign launched in 1960 the purpose of the campaign was to move the great temple of abu simbel to keep it from being swamped by the nile after construction of the aswan dam during the 20-year campaign 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated this was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including mohenjo-daro pakistan fes morocco kathmandu nepal borobudur indonesia and the acropolis greece the organizations work on heritage led to the adoption in 1972 of the convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage the world heritage committee was established in 1976 and the first sites inscribed on the world heritage list in 1978 since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by unesco member states in 2003 convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage and 2005 convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions an intergovernmental meeting of unesco in paris in december 1951 led to the creation of the european council for nuclear research which was responsible for establishing the european organization for nuclear research cern in 1954 arid zone programming 1948–1966 is another example of an early major unesco project in the field of natural sciences in 1968 unesco organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development a problem which continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development the main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of unescos man and the biosphere programme in the field of communication the free flow of information has been a priority for unesco from its beginnings in the years immediately following world war ii efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world unesco started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s in response to calls for a new world information and communication order in the late 1970s unesco established the international commission for the study of communication problems which produced the 1980 macbride report named after the chair of the commission the nobel peace prize laureate seán macbride following the macbride report unesco introduced the information society for all programme and toward knowledge societies programme in the lead up to the world summit on the information society in 2003 geneva and 2005 tunis in 2011 palestine became a unesco member following a vote in which 107 member states supported and 14 opposed laws passed in the united states in 1990 and 1994 mean that it cannot contribute financially to any un organisation that accepts palestine as a full member as a result it withdrew its funding which accounted for about 22 of unescos budget israel also reacted to palestines admittance to unesco by freezing israel payments to the unesco and imposing sanctions to the palestinian authority claiming that palestines admittance would be detrimental to potential peace talks two years after they stopped paying their

the past particularly in its relationships with the united states the united kingdom singapore and the former soviet union during the 1970s and 1980s unescos support for a new world information and communication order and its macbride report calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb freedom of the press unesco was perceived by some as a platform for communists and third world dictators to attack the west a stark contrast to accusations made by the ussr in the late 1940s and early 1950s in 1984 the united states withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest followed by the united kingdom in 1985 singapore took the opportunity to withdraw also at the end of 1985 citing rising membership fees following a change of government in 1997 the uk rejoined the united states rejoined in 2003 followed by singapore on 8 october 2007 israel israel was admitted to unesco in 1949 one year after its creation israel has maintained its membership since 1949 in 2010 israel designated the cave of the patriarchs hebron and rachels tomb bethlehem as national heritage sites and announced restoration work prompting criticism from the united states and protests from palestinians in october 2010 unescos executive board voted to declare the sites as al-haram al-ibrahimitomb of the patriarchs and bilal bin rabah mosquerachels tomb and stated that they were an integral part of the occupied palestinian territories and any unilateral israeli action was a violation of international law unesco described the sites as significant to people of the muslim christian and jewish traditions and accused israel of highlighting only the jewish character of the sites israel in turn accused unesco of detaching the nation of israel from its heritage and accused it of being politically motivated the rabbi of the western wall claimed that rachels tomb had not previously been declared a holy muslim site israel partially suspended ties with unesco israeli deputy foreign minister danny ayalon declared that the resolution was a part of palestinian escalation zevulun orlev chairman of the knesset education and culture committee referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of unesco as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world on 28 june 2011 unescos world heritage committee at jordans insistence censured israels decision to demolish and rebuild the mughrabi gate bridge in jerusalem for safety reasons israel stated that jordan had signed an agreement with israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons jordan disputed the agreement saying that it was only signed under u.s pressure israel was also unable to address the unesco committee over objections from egypt in january 2014 days before it was scheduled to open unesco director-general irina bokova indefinitely postponed and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the simon wiesenthal center entitled the people the book the land the 3,500-year relationship between the jewish people and the land of israel the event was scheduled to run from 21 january through 30 january in paris bokova cancelled the event after representatives of arab states at unesco argued that its display would harm the peace process the author of the exhibition professor robert wistrich of the hebrew universitys vidal sassoon international center for the study of anti-semitism called the cancellation an appalling act and characterized bokovas decision as an arbitrary act of total cynicism and really contempt for the jewish people and its history unesco amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success on 13 october 2016 unesco passed a resolution on east jerusalem that condemned israel for aggressions by israeli police and soldiers and illegal measures against the freedom of worship and muslims access to their holy sites while also recognizing israel as the occupying power palestinian leaders welcomed the decision while the text acknowledged the importance of the old city of jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in jerusalems old city only by its muslim name al-haram al-sharif arabic for noble sanctuary in response israel denounced the unesco resolution for its omission of the words temple mount stating that it denies jewish ties to the key holy site after receiving criticism from numerous israeli politicians and diplomats including benjamin netanyahu and ayelet shaked israel froze all ties with the organization the resolution was condemned by ban ki-moon and the director-general of unesco irina bokova who said that judaism islam and christianity have clear historical connections to jerusalem and to deny conceal or erase any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site al-aqsa mosque is also temple mount whose western wall is the holiest place in judaism it was also rejected by the czech parliament which said the resolution reflects a hateful anti-israel sentiment and hundreds of italian jews demonstrated in rome over italy abstention on october 26 unesco approved a reviewed version of the resolution which also criticized israel for its continuous refusal to let the bodys experts access jerusalems holy sites to determine their conservation status despite containing some softening of language following israeli protests over a previous version israel continued to denounce the text the resolution refers to the site jews and christians refer to as the temple mount only by its arab name — a significant semantic decision also adopted by unescos executive board last week triggering condemnation from israel and its allies u.s ambassador crystal nix hines stated this item should have been defeated these politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of unesco in november 2016 the city council of beverly hills california passed a resolution to condemn the unesco resolution palestinian authority palestinian youth magazine controversy in february 2011 an article was published in a palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role-models as adolf hitler in december 2011 unesco which partly funded the magazine condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support islamic university of gaza controversy in 2012 unesco decided to establish a chair at the islamic university of gaza in the field of astronomy astrophysics and space sciences fueling much controversy and criticism israels foreign ministry criticized the move and stated that the university supports hamas which israel and other countries designate as a terrorist organization and houses bomb laboratories for hamas the university has been linked to hamas in the past however the university head kamalain shaath defended unesco stating that the islamic university is a purely academic university that is interested only in education and its development israeli ambassador to unesco nimrod barkan planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the universitys ties to hamas especially angry that this was the first palestinian university that unesco chose to cooperate with the jewish organization bnai brith criticized the move as well wikileaks on 16 and 17 february 2012 unesco held a conference entitled the media world after wikileaks and news of the world despite all six panels being focused on wikileaks no member of wikileaks staff were invited to speak after receiving a complaint from wikileaks spokesman kristinn hrafnsson unesco invited him to attend but did not offer a place on any panels the offer also came only a week before the conference which was held in paris france many of the speakers featured including david leigh and heather brooke had spoken out openly against wikileaks and its founder julian assange in the past wikileaks released a press statement on 15 february 2012 denouncing unesco which stated unesco has made itself an international human rights joke to use freedom of expression to censor wikileaks from a conference about wikileaks is an orwellian absurdity beyond words che guevara in 2013 unesco announced that the collection the life and works of ernesto che guevara became part of the memory of the world register ileana ros-lehtinen a us congresswoman condemned this decision saying that the organization acts against its own ideals this decision is more than an insult to the families of those cubans who were lined up and summarily executed by che and his merciless cronies it also serves as a direct contradiction to the unesco ideals of encouraging peace and universal respect for human rights un watch also condemned this selection by unesco listing nanjing massacre documents in 2015 japan threatened to halt funding for unesco over the organizations decision to include documents relating to the 1937 nanjing massacre in the latest listing for its memory of the world program in october 2016 japanese foreign minister fumio kishida confirmed that japans 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the
