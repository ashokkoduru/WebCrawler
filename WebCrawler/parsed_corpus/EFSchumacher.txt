schumacher moved back to england before world war ii as he had no intention of living under nazism for a period during the war he was interned on an isolated english farm as an enemy alien in these years schumacher captured the attention of john maynard keynes with a paper entitled multilateral clearing that he had written between sessions working in the fields of the internment camp keynes recognised the young germans understanding and abilities and he was able to have schumacher released from internment schumacher helped the british government mobilise economically and financially during world war ii and keynes found a position for him at oxford university according to leopold kohrs obituary for schumacher when multilateral clearing was published in the spring of 1943 in economica it caused some embarrassment to keynes who instead of arranging for its separate publication had incorporated the text almost verbatim in his famous plan for an international clearing union which the british government issued as a white paper a few weeks later adviser to the coal board after the war schumacher worked as an economic advisor to and later chief statistician for the british control commission which was charged with rebuilding the german economy from 1950 to 1970 he was chief economic adviser to the national coal board one of the worlds largest organisations with 800,000 employees in this position he argued that coal not petroleum should be used to supply the energy needs of the worlds population he saw oil as a finite resource fearing its depletion and eventually prohibitive price and viewed with alarm the reality that the richest and cheapest reserves are located in some of the worlds most unstable countries his position on the coal board was often mentioned later by those introducing schumacher or his ideas it is generally thought that his farsighted planning contributed to britains post-war economic recovery schumacher predicted the rise of opec and many of the problems of nuclear power thinking outside the box in 1955 schumacher travelled to burma as an economic consultant while there he developed the set of principles he called buddhist economics based on the belief that individuals need good work for proper human development he also proclaimed that production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life he travelled throughout many third world countries encouraging local governments to create self-reliant economies schumachers experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology user-friendly and ecologically suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community a concept very close to ivan illichs conviviality he founded the intermediate technology development group now practical action in 1966 his theories of development have been summed up for many in catch phrases such as intermediate size and intermediate technology he was a trustee of scott bader commonwealth and in 1970 the president of the soil association e f schumacher was greatly influenced by mahatma gandhi and j c kumarappa and gandhis concepts of economy of permanence and appropriate technology while delivering the gandhi memorial lecture at the gandhian institute of studies at varanasi india in 1973 schumacher described gandhi as the greatest peoples economist whose economic thinking was compatible with spirituality as opposed to materialism schumacher as writer schumacher wrote on economics for londons the times and became one of the papers chief editorial writers at this post he was assigned the somewhat uncomfortable task of compiling information for the obituary of john maynard keynes many years before the event of his death he also wrote for the economist and resurgence he served as adviser to the india planning commission as well as to the governments of zambia and burma – an experience that led to his much-read essay buddhist economics the 1973 publication of small is beautiful a study of economics as if people mattered a collection of essays finished in the house of his friend leopold kohr brought his ideas to a wider audience one of his main arguments in small is beautiful is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite natural capital and deprive future generations of its benefits schumachers work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism and he became a hero to many in the environmental movement and community movement in 1976 he received the prestigious award prix européen de lessai charles veillon for small is beautiful his 1977 work a guide for the perplexed is both a critique of materialistic scientism and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge later life as a young man schumacher was a dedicated atheist but his later rejection of materialist capitalist agnostic modernity was paralleled by a growing fascination with religion he developed an interest in buddhism but beginning in the late 1950s catholicism heavily influenced his thinking he noted the similarities between his own economic views and the teaching of papal encyclicals on socio-economic issues from leo xiiis rerum novarum to pope john xxiiis mater et magistra as well as with the distributism supported by the catholic thinkers g k chesterton hilaire belloc and vincent mcnabb philosophically he absorbed much of thomism which provided an objective system in contrast to what he saw as the self-centered subjectivism and relativism of modern philosophy and society he also was greatly interested in the tradition of christian mysticism and read deeply such writers as st teresa of avila and thomas merton these were all interests that he shared with his friend the catholic writer christopher derrick in 1971 he converted to catholicism schumacher gave interviews and
