very scrutinizing process and that he was a man of integrity in the final informal poll on 2 october ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention no opinion from the fifteen members of the security council the one abstention came from the japanese delegation who vehemently opposed the idea of a korean taking the role of secretary-general due to the overwhelming support of ban by the

tribunal remarking the issue of capital punishment is for each and every member state to decide bans statements contradicted long-standing united nations opposition to the death penalty as a human-rights concern he quickly clarified his stance in the case of barzan al-tikriti and awad al-bandar two top officials who were convicted of the deaths of 148 shia muslims in the iraqi village of

the un peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department his proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the un general assembly who bristled under bans request for rapid approval the proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world partially because of rumours that

began extensive consultation with un ambassadors agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted after the consultations ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and

delegates expressed resentment at bans perceived favoritism in the appointment of south korean nationals in key posts previous un chiefs such as kurt waldheim austria javier pérez de cuéllar peru and boutros boutros-ghali egypt brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their countrys foreign ministry but according to some officials in the post story ban has gone further boosting south koreas presence in un ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office in response ban and his aides have claimed that allegations of favoritism are wrong and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of racism he said that the south korean nationals he had appointed—including choi young-jin who has served as a high-ranking official in the united nations peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions others such as donald p gregg a former u.s ambassador to south korea say the complaints are driven by envy i think being from south korea and people have growing respect for south korea thats a great enhancement for the secretary general if he brings along talented people who whom he knows very well i think thats also a plus un records show that south korea the organizations eleventh-largest financial contributor had 54 south korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before ban took over the top un post former un under secretary general for oversight services inga-britt ahlenius denounced ban ki-moon after resigning her post in 2010 calling him reprehensible ahleniuss critique was based on the grounds that the secretary-general consistently made efforts to undermine the office of internal oversight services oios mandate and challenge its operational independence in particular the two disputed ahleniuss plans to hire a former prosecutor robert appleton who had carried out aggressive investigations into corruption in un peacekeeping missions from 2006 to 2009 bans staff explained that appletons appointment was rejected because female candidates had not been properly considered and said that the final selection should have been made by ban not ahlenius however ahlenius countered in her end of assignment memo that for the secretary-general to control appointments in oios is an infringement of the operational independence of oios and further stated there is no transparency there is lack of accountability rather than supporting the internal oversight which is the sign of strong leadership and good governance you have strived to undermine its position and to control it i do not see any signs of reform in the organization during the roks cheonan sinking events he took the step of demanding action against north korea for the alleged sinking of a vessel from his country this was reported by u.n dispatch as being unusual because it is rare for any secretary-general—and particularly ban ki-moon—to comment on the security council taking action on an issue as his office had tended to be extremely deferential to the security council former un corruption fighter james wasserstrom has also been critical of ban ki-moon for attempting to limit the jurisdiction of the un dispute tribunal following his dismissal from his kosovo and lengthy appeals process ban had refused to hand over confidential documents relating to the case to the un personnel tribunal despite repeated orders by the court to do so in relation to another case ban was admonished by judge michael adams for wilful disobedience for again failing to hand over key documents in an internal promotions dispute in 2013 ban ki moon was accused of undermining collective bargaining rights of the staff coordinating council the union representing united nations staff ban unilaterally eliminated the role of the union to negotiate on behalf of the employees and terminated talks when the union protested the united nations champions the right to collective bargaining as a basic human right in its own charter enacted as the right to organise and collective bargaining convention 1949 article 1 international human rights organizations are critical of ban ki-moon for lacking accountability

approximately 9,000 people and infected more than 1 in 20 haitians ban has declared that the legal immunity of the united nations before national courts should be upheld though this does not reduce the uns moral responsibility to overcoming haitis cholera epidemic ban is named in a lawsuit challenging un immunity on behalf of haitian cholera victims in the u.s district court of manhattan in january 2015 judge j paul oetken dismissed the case affirming un immunity an appeal to oetkens decision was submitted to the court in may 2015 much press coverage of ban has been critical with the economist in may 2016 calling him plodding protocol-conscious and loth to stand up to the big powers and the dullest—and among the worst secretary-generals an article in the guardian of july 2010 calls his performance deplorable although ban is defended by some asian commentators who see his understated presence as more quietly confucian 2017 presidential candidacy speculation according to most opinion polling ban is the leading potential candidate for president of south korea in 2017 leading most of major polls in korea as of september 2016 however a un resolution in 1946 says a secretary-general should refrain from accepting any governmental position at any rate immediately on retirement exceptions to the rule have been made in past history with the 1986 election of kurt waldheim to the post of president of austria although the position is ceremonial in nature kim jong-pil former prime minister of south korea was reported to say that ban ki-moon would announce his candidacy for the presidency shortly after his term as secretary-general ends personal life family ban ki-moon met yoo soon-taek in 1962 when they were both in high school ban was 18 years old and yoo

practitioners of geomancy went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group and has declined to expound his beliefs now as secretary-general it will not be appropriate at this time to talk about my own belief in any particular religion or god so maybe we will have some other time to talk about personal matters his mother is buddhist personality during his tenure at the south korean foreign ministry bans nickname was jusa 주사 meaning the administrative clerk the name was used as both positive and negative
