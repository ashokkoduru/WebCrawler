industrialist and alexander king a scottish scientist it was formed when a small international group of people from the fields of academia civil society diplomacy and industry met at a villa in rome hence the name hasan Özbekhan erich jantsch and alexander christakis were responsible for conceptualizing the original prospectus of the club of rome titled the predicament of mankind the club of rome raised considerable public attention with its report limits to growth which has sold 30 million copies in more than 30 translations making it the best-selling environmental book in world history published in 1972 and presented for the first time at the international students committee isc annual management symposium in st gallen switzerland it predicted that economic growth could not continue indefinitely because of the limited availability of natural resources particularly oil the 1973 oil crisis increased public concern about this problem however even before limits to growth was published eduard pestel and mihajlo mesarovic of case western reserve university had begun work on a far more elaborate model it distinguished ten world regions and involved 200,000 equations compared with 1000 in the meadows model the research had the full support of the club and the final publication mankind at the turning point was accepted as the official second report to the club of rome in 1974 in addition to providing a more refined regional breakdown pestel and mesarovic had succeeded in integrating social as well as technical data the second report revised the scenarios of the original limits to growth and gave a more optimistic prognosis for the future of the environment noting that many of the factors were within human control and therefore that environmental and economic catastrophe were preventable or avoidable hence the title in 1991 the club published the first global revolution it analyses the problems of humanity calling these collectively or in essence the problematique it notes laments that historically social or political unity has commonly been motivated by enemies in common the need for enemies seems to be a common historical factor some states have striven to overcome domestic failure and internal contradictions by blaming external enemies the ploy of finding a scapegoat is as old as mankind itself  when things become too difficult at home divert attention to adventure abroad bring the divided nation together to face an outside enemy either a real one or else one invented for the purpose with the disappearance of the traditional enemy the temptation is to use religious or ethnic minorities as scapegoats especially those whose differences from the majority are disturbing every state has been so used to classifying its neighbours as friend or foe that the sudden absence of traditional adversaries has left governments and public opinion with a great void to fill new enemies have to be identified new strategies imagined and new weapons devised in searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill in their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together but in designating these dangers as the enemy we fall into the trap which we have already warned readers about namely mistaking symptoms for causes all these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself in 2001 the club of rome established a think tank called tt30 comprising around 30 men and women ages 25–35 it aimed to identify and solve problems in the world from a younger perspective a study by graham turner of the research organisation csiro in australia in 2008 found that 30 years of historical data compare favorably with key features of a business-as-usual scenario called the ‘‘standard run’’ scenario which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st century organization according
