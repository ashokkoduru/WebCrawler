its actual output over a period of time to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time to calculate the capacity factor take the total amount of energy the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of fuel that is used and the design of the plant the capacity factor should not be confused with the availability factor capacity credit firm capacity or with efficiency sample calculations nuclear power plant a nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts mw might produce 648,000 megawatt-hours mw·h in a 30-day month the number of megawatt-hours that would have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity can be determined by multiplying the plants maximum capacity by the number of hours in the time period 1,000 mw × 30 days × 24 hoursday is 720,000 mw·h the capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual output with the maximum possible output in this case the capacity factor is 0.9 90 palo verde nuclear generating station is the largest nuclear plant in the us with a nameplate capacity of 3,942 mw between its three reactors with an annual generation of 31,200,000 mwh in 2010 the capacity factor was 90.4 each of palo verde’s three reactors is refueled every 18 months with one refueling every spring and fall in 2014 a refueling was completed in a record 28 days wind farm the danish wind farm horns rev 2 the worlds largest in 2009 comprises 91 siemens swt-2.3-93 wind turbines each of 2.3 mw with a nominal total capacity of 209 mw in 2012 the wind farm generated 956  gw·h of electricity the capacity factor for this wind farm was 52.1 onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60 for example the 44 mw eolo plant in nicaragua had a net generation of 232.132 mwh in 2015 equivalent to a capacity factor of 60.2 note that capacity factor is not constrained by the betz limit so capacities higher that 59.2 are possible this is because capacity measures actual production relative to possible production by the turbine as opposed to production vs energy available in the wind hydroelectric dam large rivers or large reservoirs in wet mountainous areas are ideal water supplies for hydropower in western canada the peace and columbia rivers support capacity factors averaging 85 of a 10,000mw capacity in the mild rainy oceanic climate as of 2010 three gorges dam is the largest power generating station in the world by nameplate capacity in 2009 not yet fully complete it had 26 main generator units  700 mw and two auxiliary generator units  50 mw for a total installed capacity of 18,300 mw total generation in 2009 was 79.47 tw·h for a capacity factor of just under 50 hoover dam has a nameplate capacity of 2080 mw and an annual generation averaging 4.2 tw·h the annual generation has varied between a high of 10.348 tw·h in 1984 and a low of 2.648 tw·h in 1956 taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of reasons for reduced capacity factor there are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100 the first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance this accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output geothermal plants nuclear plants coal-fired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants the second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100 is that output is curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical this accounts for most of the unused capacity of peaking power plants peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day their electricity is relatively expensive however it is only relatively expensive if determining the cost per unit of electricity be dividing total costs of production and operation by the power produced its electricity may be relatively expensive but the cost to construct and operate and maintain the plant may be a fraction of those of a mainline powerplant clearly a peaking powerplant is not constructed to cheaply produce electricity it is constructed to increase the efficiency and therefore reduce the costs of the utility as a whole if the alternative to expensive peaking power is selling no power during periods of excessive demand that create blackouts or damage to equipment and facilities during brownouts the peaking power becomes very cheap very quickly many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or times of the year because of variation in loads and electricity prices if a plant is only needed during the day for example even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day all year long it would only have a 50 capacity factor e.g that assertion falls apart if the power plant was designed and constructed for that exact purpose if a powerplant is designed intended and constructed or even later simply allocated and used to produce electrictity 12 hours per day its capacity factor is 100 rather than 50 put another way does any person consider themselves lazy 66 of the time simply because they only work 8 hours of a 24-hour day a third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time this can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources when the sun isnt shining solar pv cannot produce electricity when the wind is not blowing wind turbines cannot produce electricity solar pv and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their fuel sunshine and wind respectively again the flawed concept of capacity factor equates inactivity directly to inefficiency while wind turbines dont produce power when there is no wind theyre also not being subjected to the wear and tear that come with operation and calm periods allow maintenance and repairs to be performed without removing the unit from service when it could be operating a hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100 due to scarcity of water however its output may also simply be regulated to match the current power need conserving its stored water for later usage a hydroelectricity plant may also be designed for reverse usage so it can pump water up in its reservoir in situations with a power surplus in both cases the use of the hydroelectricity plant to stabilize the grid reduces its capacity factor hydroelectricity may have a higher capacity factor with respect to the turbine size since in some case the amount of stored water fluctuates to account for intermittent availability of water given the nearly impossible task of actually designing and constructing a hydroelectric facility to deliver the precise waterflow required to operate the generators at nameplate capacity applying the already dubious capacity factor to hydroelectric powerplants borders on absurdity in many cases hydroelectric power production is a secondary function of the dam and reservoir and it is used only to produce and sell power to produce revenue used to offset the costs of operating and maintaining the dam and reservoir some dams and reservoirs were primarily built for flood control or irrigation and are operated to perform those functions as required with electricity production occurring only when it is economically feasible and profitable to do so even an apparently full reservoir may not be sufficient to power a hydroelectric powerplant to its rated output typically hydroelectric plants are rated using a specific head determined to be the minimum water leve required to produce 100 capacity however the temperature and density of the water determine the kinetic energy it will produce as it travels from inlet to generator turbine additional factors such as fouling of the spillway or piping wear and damage of the turbine rotor and backpressure downstream from the turbine can also reduce capacity even with ideal head available further since inflow into reservoirs is constantly changing and variable as are various other conditions affecting the amount of time required for water to transit the reservoir and hydroelectric plant designing and building a hydroelectric plant capable of perfectly matching generating capacity to water availability is impossible reservoirs are constantly although perhaps imperceptibly rising and falling with resulting changes in generating capacity and in reservoirpowerplant systems where a constant head can be maintained it is invariable maintained by allowing excess water to exit the reservoir through spillways that bypass the generators in such installation water released to bypass is wasted entirely for purposes of generating electricity even when bypassing it increases the efficiency and capacity of the powerplant itself other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100 include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output by far the biggest reality affecting capacity factor is the need to perform periodic maintenance on components and systems within the powerplant and to replace or repair components when they fail or reach the end of their designed service life because electricity is readily available with the flip of switch all around us it is easy for some people to forget that powerplants are mechanical devices and systems and eventually they wear out this reality makes the entire concept of capacity factor even more questionable given that the closer to its supposedly ideal capacity factor of 100 a powerplant is operated the more maintenance and repair it will require as such a 100 capacity factor is now only imposssible to achieve it would be undesirable to do so if it were possible running a powerplant at 100 capacity factor until something catastrophically fails or wear prevents safe or efficient operation would be analogous to driving your car at its maximum speed as long as possible as often as possible in order to wear it out as quickly as possible and maximize ownership costs as much as possible but while a mechanic can install a new engine in your car in a few days major repairs and maintenance tasks in powerplants can require shutdown for weeks months and even years in some cases load following power plants load following power plants also called intermediate power plants are in between these extremes in terms of capacity factor efficiency and cost per unit of electricity they produce most of their electricity during the day when prices and demand are highest however the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight capacity factor and renewable energy when it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power wind power and hydroelectricity there is a fourth reason for unused capacity the plant may be capable of producing electricity but its fuel wind sunlight or water may not be available a hydroelectric plants production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream however solar wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors so when they have fuel available they are almost always able to produce electricity when hydroelectric plants have water available they are also useful for load following because of their high dispatchability a typical hydroelectric plants operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes wind farms are variable due to the natural variability of the wind for a wind farm the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45 though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55 capacity factor and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65 capacity factor solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth seasonal changes and because of cloud cover according to the sacramento municipal utility district observed a 15 capacity factor in 2005 however according to the solarpaces programme of the international energy agency iea solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands such as spain or the south-western united states although in some locations solar pv does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced solarpaces states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power csp stations can be extended to become dispatchable load following the iea csp technology roadmap 2010 suggests that in the sunniest countries csp can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020 and of base-load power by 2025 to 2030 a dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity water must be properly managed the source of geothermal energy the earths heat will be available for the foreseeable future geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth real world capacity factors united states according to the us energy information administration eia in 2009 the capacity factors were as follows nuclear–90.3 coal–63.8 natural gas plant–42.5 hydroelectric–39.8 renewables windsolarbiomass–33.9 oil–7.8 however these values often vary significantly by month
