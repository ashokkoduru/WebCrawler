this article is about modern movement architecture for architecture in the present day see contemporary architecture modern architecture or modernist architecture is a term applied to a group of styles of architecture which emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after world war ii it was based upon new technologies of construction particularly the use of glass steel and reinforced concrete and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and beaux-arts styles that were popular in the 19th century modern architecture continued a dominant architectural style for institutional and corporate buildings into the 21st century modernism eventually generated reactions most notably postmodernism which sought to preserve pre-modern elements while neo-modernism has emerged as a reaction to post-modernism notable architects important to the history and development of the modernist movement include frank lloyd wright ludwig mies van der rohe le corbusier walter gropius konstantin melnikov erich mendelsohn joseph eichler richard neutra louis sullivan gerrit rietveld bruno taut gunnar asplund arne jacobsen oscar niemeyer and alvar aalto characteristics common themes of modern architecture include the notion that form follows function a dictum originally expressed by frank lloyd wrights early mentor louis sullivan meaning that the result of design should derive directly from its purpose simplicity and clarity of forms and elimination of unnecessary detail materials at 90 degrees to each other visual expression of structure as opposed to the hiding of structural elements the related concept of truth to materials meaning that the true nature or natural appearance of a material ought to be seen rather than concealed or altered to represent something else use of industrially-produced materials adoption of the machine aesthetic particularly in international style modernism a visual emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines context there are multiple lenses through which the evolution of modern architecture may be viewed some historians see it as a social matter closely tied to the project of modernity and thus the enlightenment modern architecture developed in their opinion as a result of social and political revolutions others see modern architecture as primarily driven by technological and engineering developments still other historians regard modernism as a matter of taste a reaction against eclecticism and the lavish stylistic excesses of victorian and edwardian architecture with the industrial revolution the availability of newly-available building materials such as iron steel and sheet glass drove the invention of new building techniques in 1796 shrewsbury mill owner charles bage first used his fireproof design which relied on cast iron and brick with flag stone floors such construction greatly strengthened the structure of mills which enabled them to accommodate much bigger machines due to poor knowledge of irons properties as a construction material a number of early mills collapsed it was not until the early 1830s that eaton hodgkinson introduced the section beam leading to widespread use of iron construction this kind of austere industrial architecture utterly transformed the landscape of northern britain leading to the description of places like manchester and parts of west yorkshire as dark satanic mills the crystal palace by joseph paxton at the great exhibition of 1851 was an early example of iron and glass construction followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal curtain wall a further development was that of the steel-framed skyscraper in chicago around 1890 by william le baron jenney and louis sullivan early modernism in europe 1900-1914 the glasgow school of art by charles rennie macintosh 1896-99 reinforced concrete apartment building by auguste perret paris 1903 austrian postal savings bank in vienna by otto wagner 1904-1906 the aeg turbine factory by peter behrens 1909 the steiner house in vienna by adolf loos 1910 stoclet palace by josef hoffmann brussels 1906-1911 the théâtre des champs-Élysées in paris by auguste perret 1911-1913 stepped concrete apartment building in paris by henri sauvage 1912-1914 the fagus factory in alfeld by walter gropius and adolf meyer 1911-13 the glass pavilion in cologne by german architect bruno taut 1914 at the end of the 19th century a few architects began to challenge the traditional beaux arts and neoclassical styles that dominated architecture in europe and the united states the glasgow school of art 1896-99 designed by charles rennie macintosh had a facade dominated by large vertical bays of windows the art nouveau style was launched in the 1890s by victor horta in belgium and hector guimard in france it introduced new styles of decoration based on vegetal and floral forms in barcelona antonio gaudi conceived architecture as a form of sculpture the facade of the casa battlo in barcelona 1904-1907 had no straight lines it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques which gave them greater freedom to create new forms in 1903-1904 in paris auguste perret and henri sauvage began to use reinforced concrete previously only used for industrial structures to build apartment buildings reinforced concrete which could be molded into any shape and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects the first concrete apartment buildings by perret and sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles but in 1905 perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de ponthieu in paris here the concrete was left bare and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows henri sauvage added another construction innovation in an apartment building on rue vavin in paris 1912-1914 the reinforced concrete building was in steps with each floor set back from the floor below creating a series of terraces between 1910 and 1913 auguste perret built the théâtre des champs-Élysées a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction with art deco sculptural bas-reliefs on he facade by antoine bourdelle because of the concrete construction no columns blocked the spectators view of the stage otto wagner in vienna was another pioneer of the new style in his book moderne arkchtekture 1895 he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture based on modern life he designed a stylized ornamental metro station at karlsplatz in vienna 1888-89 then an ornamental art nouveau residence majolika house 1898 before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style without ornament in the austrian postal savings bank 1904-1906 wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior the reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum the interior was purely functional and spare a large open space of steel glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself  the viennese architect adolf loos also began removing any ornament from his buildings his steiner house in vienna 1910 was an example of what he called rationalist architecture it had a simple stucco rectangual facade with square windows and no ornament  the fame of the new movement which became known as the vienna secession spread beyond austria josef hoffmann a student of wagner constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture the palais stoclet in brussels in 1906-1911 this residence built of brick covered with norwegian marble was composed of geometric blocks wings and a tower a large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms the interior was decorated with paintings by gustav klimt and other artists and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture in germany a modernist industrial movement deutscher werkbund german work federation had been created in munich in 1907 by hermann muthesius a prominent architectural commentator its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists to turn out well-designed high quality products and in the process to invent a new type of architecture the organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms but quickly expanded the architects include peter behrens theodor fischer who served as its first president josef hoffmann and richard riemerschmid in 1909 behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style the aeg turbine factory a functional monument of steel and concrete in 1911-1913 adolf meyer and walter gropius who had both worked for behrens built another revolutionary industrial plant the fagus factory in alfeld an der leine a building without ornament where every construction element was on display the werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the first world war in august 1914 for the 1914 cologne exhibition bruno taut built a revolutionary glass pavilion early american modernism 1900-1914 see also frank lloyd wright joseph eichler and richard

1904-1906 interior of unity temple by frank lloyd wright oak park illinois 1905-1908 the robie house by frank lloyd wright chicago 1909 frank lloyd wright was a highly original and independent american architect who refused to be categorized in any one architectural movement like le corbusier and mies van der rohe he had no formal architectural training in 1887-93 he worked in the chicago office of louis sullivan who pioneered the first tall steel-frame office buildings in chicago and who famously stated form follows function wright set out to break all the traditional rules wright was particularly famous for his prairie houses including the winslow house in river forest illinois1893-94,arthur heurtley house 1902 and robie house 1909 sprawling geometric residences without decoration with strong horizontal lines which seemed to grow out of the earth and which echoed the wide flat spaces of the american prairie his larkin building 1904-1906 in buffalo new york unity temple 1905 in oak park illinois and unity temple had highly original forms and no connection with historical precedents the birth of the skyscraper main article early skyscrapers home insurance building in chicago

chicago by louis sullivan 1904-1906 the woolworth building and the new york skyline in 1913 it was modern on the inside but neo-gothic on the outside the neo-gothic crown of the woolworth building by cass gilbert 1912 at the end of the 19th century the first skyscrapers began to appear in the united states they were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing american cities and the availability of new technologies including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety elevator invented by elisha otis in 1852 the first steel-framed skyscraper the home insurance building in chicago was ten stories high it was designed by william le baron jenney in 1883 and was briefly the tallest building in the world it was surpassed by the home insurance building of louis sullivan in buffalo new york sullivan built another monumental new structure the carson pirie scott and company building in the heart of chicago in 1904-06 while these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height the designs of their facades were in the more traditional neo-renaissance neo-gothic and beaux-arts architecture the woolworth building designed by cass gilbert was completed in 1912 and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the chrysler building in 1929 its exterior was in the neo-gothic style complete with decorative buttresses arches and spires which caused it be be nicknamed the cathedral of commerce the rise of modernism 1919-1930 after the first world war a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of neo-classicism and the beaux-arts architecture style and the modernists led by le corbusier and robert mallet-stevens in france walter gropius and mies van der rohe in germany and konstantin melnikov in the new soviet union who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration art deco architects such as auguste perret and henri sauvage often made a compromise between the two combining modernist forms and stylized decoration le corbusier and mallet-stevens the villa la roche-jeanerette now fondation le corbusier by le corbusier paris 1923-24 corbusier haus in weissenhof estate stuttgart germany 1927 citrohan haus in weissenhof estate stuttgart germany by le corbusier 1927 the villa savoye in poissy

1926-1927 the dominant figure in the rise of modernism in france was charles-Édouard jeanneret a swiss-french architect who in 1920 took the name le corbusier in 1920 he co-founded a journal called lespirit nouveau and energetically promoted architecture that was functional pure and free of any decoration or historical associations he was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism based on planned cities in 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people whose inhabitants lived in identical sixty-story tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland he designed modular houses which would be mass-produced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks neighborhoods and cities in 1923 he published toward an architecture with his famous slogan a machine is a house to live in he tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans articles books conferences and participation in expositions to illustrate his ideas in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around paris they were all built according to a common system based upon the use of reinforced concrete and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans independent of the structure they were always white and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside the best-known of these houses was the villa savoye built in 1928-1931 in the paris suburb of poissy an elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn it became an icon of modernist architecture the bauhaus and the german werkbund main article bauhaus the bauhaus school building at dessau germany designed by walter gropius 1926 a bauhaus design for a workers apartment by walter gropius 1928-30 the barcelona pavilion modern reconstruction by mies van de rohe 1929 in germany two important modernist movements appeared after the first world war the bauhaus was a school organized weimar in 1919 under the direction of walter gropius gropius was the son of the official state architect of berlin who studied before the war with peter behrens and designed the modernist fagus turbine factory the bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar academy of arts and the school of technology in 1926 it was transferred from weimar to dessau gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new purely functional modernist style he was encouraging the school brought together modernists in all fields the faculty included the modernist painters vasily kandinsky joseph albers and paul klee and the designer marcel breuer gropius became an important theorist of modernism writing ‘’the idea and construction’’ in 1923 he was an advocate of standardization in architecture and the mass construction of rationally-designed apartment blocks for factory workers in 1928 he was commissioned by the siemens company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of berlin and in 1929 the proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight to ten story high rise apartment towers for workers while gropius was active at the bauhaus ludwig mies van der rohe led the modernist architectural movement in berlin inspired by the de stijl movement in the netherlands he build clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower he became the vice president of the german ‘’werkbund’’ and became the head of the bauhaus from 1930t to 1932 proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction his most famous modernist work was the german pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in barcelona it was a work of pure modernism with glass and concrete walls and clean horizontal lines though it was only a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 it became along with le corbusier’s villa savoye one of best-known landmarks of modernist architecture a reconstructed version now stands on the original site in barcelona when the nazis came to power in germany they viewed the bauhaus as a training ground for communists and closed the school in 1932 gropius left germany and went to england then to the united states he and marel breuer where he and marcel breuer both joined the faculty of the harvard graduate school of design and became the teachers of a generation of american postwar architects in 1937 mies van der rohe also moved to the united states,he became one of the most famous designers of postwar american skyscrapers expressionism foyer of the großes schauspielhaus or great theater in berlin by hans poelzig 1919 the einstein tower by erich mendelsohn 1920-24 the mossehaus in berlin by erich mendelsohn an early example of streamline moderne 1921-23 the chilehaus in hamburg by fritz höger 1921-24 horseshoe-shaped public housing project by bruno taut 1925 the main building of goethe university originally the ig farben building in frankfurt designed by hans poelzig 1928-30 expressionism which appeared in germany between 1910 and 1925 was a counter-movement against the strictly functional architecture of the bauhaus and werkbund its advocates including bruno taut hans poelzig fritz hoger and erich mendelsohn wanted to create architecture that was poetic expressive and optimistic mendelsohn who rejected the term designed churches silos observatories and factories which were highly imaginative but were never built in 1920 he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of potsdam an observatory and research center called the einsteinium named in tribute to albert einstein it was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster his sculptural form very different from the austere rectangular forms of the bauhaus first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores his mossehaus in berlin was an early model for the streamline moderne style fritz höger was another notable expressionist architect of the period his chilehaus was built as the headquarters of a shipping company and was modeled after a giant steamship a triangual building with a sharply pointed bow it was constructed of dark brick and used external piers to express its vertical structure its external decoration borrowed from gothic cathedrals as did its internal arcades hans poelzig was another notable expressionist architect in 1919 he built the großes schauspielhaus an immense theater in berlin seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario max reinhardt it featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome and lights on massive columns in its foyer he also constructed the ig farben building a massive corporate headquarters now the main building of goethe university in frankfurt bruno taut specialized in building large scale apartment complexes for working-class berliners he built twelve thousand individual units sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes such as a giant horseshoe unlike most other modernists he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life making notable use of sculptural forms and the novel use of concrete as artistic elements examples include rudolf steiners second goetheanum built from 1926 near basel switzerland and the einsteinturm in potsdam germany the style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials formal innovation and very unusual massing sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick steel and especially glass many expressionist architects fought in world war i and their experiences combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the german revolution of 1919 resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper such as bruno tauts alpine architecture and hermann finsterlins formspiels ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period scenography for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate a particular type using bricks to create its forms rather than concrete is known as brick expressionism russian constructivism model of the tower for the third international by vladimir tatlin 1919 the lenin mausoleum in moscow by alexey shchusev 1924 the ussr pavilion at the 1925 paris exposition of decorative arts by konstantin melnikov 1925 rusakov workers club moscow by konstantin melnikov 1928 derzhprom the house of industry kharkiv by sergey serafimovich samul kravets and marc felger 1928 main article constructivist architecture after the russian revolution of 1917 russian avant-garde artists and architects began searching for a new soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism the new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period the futurism of poet vladimir mayakovskiy the suprematism of painter kasimir malevich and the colorful rayonism of painter mikhail larionov the most most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor vladimir tatlin for the moscow meeting of the third communist international in 1920 he proposed two interlaced towers of of metal four hundred meters high with four geometric volumes suspended from cables the movement of russian constructivist architecture was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by aleksandr rodchenko their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the communist expression of material structures soviet architects began to construct workers clubs communal apartment houses and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods one of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in moscow was konstantin melnikov,the number of working clubs  including rusakov workers club 1928  and his own living house melnikov house 1929 near arbat street in moscow melnikov traveled to paris in 1925 where he built the soviet pavilion for the international exhibition of modern decorative and industrial arts in paris in 1925 it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway and crowned with a hammer and sickle the leading group of constructivist architects led by vesnin brothers and moisei ginzburg was publishing the contemporary architecture journal this group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the first five year plan  including colossal dnieper hydroelectric station 1932  and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with ginzburgs narkomfin building a number of architects from the pre-soviet period also took up the constructivist style the most famous example was lenins mausoleum in moscow 1924 by alexey shchusev 1924 the main centers of constructivist architecture were moscow and leningrad however during the industrialization lots of constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities the regional industrial centers including ekaterinburg kharkiv or ivanovo were rebuilt in the constructivist manner some cities like magnitogorsk or zaporizhia were constructed anew the so-called socgorod or socialist city the style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that stalin favored constructivist architects and even le corbusier projects for the new palace of the soviets from 1931 to 1933 but the winner was an early stalinist building in the style termed postconstructivism the last major russian constructivist building by boris iofan was built for the paris world exhibition 1937 where it faced the pavilion of nazi germany by hitlers architect albert speer modernism becomes a movement  the ciam 1928 by the late 1920s modernism had become an important movement in europe architecture which previously had been predominantly national began to become international they architects traveled met each other and shared ideas several modernists including le corbusier had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the league of nations in 1927 in the same year the german werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the weissenhof estate stuttgart seventeen leading modernist architects in europe were invited to design twenty-one houses le corbusier and mies van der rohe played a major part in 1927 le corbusier pierre chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style the first meeting of the congrès internationaux darchitecture moderne or international congresses of modern architects ciam was held in a chateau on lake leman in switzerland june 26-28 1928 those attending included le corbusier robert mallet-stevens auguste perret pierre chareau and tony garnier from france victor bourgeois from belgium walter gropius erich mendelsohn ernst may and mies van der rohe from germany josef frank from austria mart stam and gerrit rietveld from the netherlands,and adolf loos from czechoslovakia a delegation of soviet architects was invited to attend but they were unable to obtain visas later members included josep lluís sert of spain and alvar aalto of finland no one attended from the united states a second meeting was organized in 1930 in brussels by victor bourgeois on the topic rational methods for groups of habitations a third meeting on the functional city was scheduled for moscow in 1932 but was cancelled at the last minute instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between marseille and athens on board they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized the text called the athens charter after considerable editing by corbusier and others was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s the group met once more in paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the united states in 1939 but the meeting was cancelled because of the war the legacy of the ciam was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in europe and the united states after world war ii  art deco main article art deco pavilion of the galeries lafayette department store at the paris international exposition of decorative arts 1925 the grand rex movie theater in paris 1932 the palais de chaillot by louis-hippolyte boileau jacques carlu and léon azéma from the 1937 paris international exposition the art deco architectural style called style moderne in france was modern but it was not modernist it had many features of modernism including the use of reinforced concrete glass steel chrome and it rejected traditional historical models such as the beaux-arts style and neo-classicism but unlike the modernist styles of le corbusier and mies van der rohe it made lavish use of decoration and color it reveled in the symbols of modernity lightning flashes sunrises and zig-zags art deco had begun in france before world war i and spread through europe in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the united states south america india china australia and japan in europe art deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters the style reached its peak in europe at the international exhibition of modern decorative and industrial arts in 1925 which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries only two pavilions were purely modernist the esprit nouveau pavilion of le corbusier which represented his idea for a massproduced housing unit and the pavilion of the ussr by konstantin melnikov in a flamboyantly futurist style later french landmarks in the art deco style included the rex theater in paris la samaritaine department store by henri sauvage 1926–28 and the social and economic council building in paris 1937–38 by auguste perret and the palais de tokyo and palais de chaillot both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 paris exposition internationale des arts et techniques dans la vie

the first skyscrapers in chicago and new york had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style but these buildings were very different they combined modern materials and technology stainless steel concrete aluminum chrome-plated steel with art deco geometry stylized zig-zags lightning flashes fountains sunrises and at the top of the chrysler building art deco gargoyles in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments the interiors of these new buildings sometimes termed cathedrals of commerce were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors with geometric patterns variously influenced by egyptian and mayan pyramids african textile patterns and european cathedrals frank lloyd wright himself experimented with mayan revival,in the concrete cube-based ennis house of 1924 in los angeles the style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major american cities the style was used most often in office buildings but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced the streamline style the beginning of the great depression in 1929 brought an end to lavishly-decorated art deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers it also brought in a new style called streamline moderne or sometimes just streamline this style sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners featured rounded corners strong horizontal lines and often nautical features such as superstructures and steel railings it was associated with modernity and especially with transportation the style was often used for new airport terminals train and bus stations and for gas stations and diners built along the growing american highway system in the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings but in railroad locomotives and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners it both borrowed from industrial design and influenced it more restrained forms with national imagery were adopted in the united states it took the form of stripped classicism alternatively pwa moderne or wpa moderne a stark version of the neoclassicism of federal buildings earlier in the century it application ranged in scale from local post-offices to the pentagon at the same time as noted above the rise in nationalism was reflected in the stalinist architecture of the soviet union fascist architecture of italy and nazi architecture of germany what historian kenneth frampton termed the new tradition to a less political extent such an idea of modernized tradition could also be seen in contemporaneous mycenaean revival architecture during and following world war ii this broad branch of modern architecture declined with the rise of the international style and other mid-century architecture american modernism  frank lloyd wright rudolph schindler richard neutra 1919-1939 ennis house in los angeles by frank lloyd wright 1924 fallingwater by frank lloyd wright 1928-34 main articles frank lloyd wright rudolph schindler architect and richard neutra during the 1920s and 1930s frank lloyd wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements he considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own between 1916 and 1922 he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement this became known as his mayan style after the pyramids of the ancient mayan civilization he experimented for a time with modular mass-produced housing he identified his architecture as usonian a combination of usa utopian and organic social order his business was severely affected by the beginning of the great depression that began in 1929 he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment between 1928 and 1935 he built only two buildings a hotel near chandler arizona and the most famous of all his residences fallingwater 1934-37 a vacation house in pennsylvania for edgar j kaufman fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall perfectly uniting architecture and nature wartime innovation world war ii 1939–1945 and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology and in turn architectural possibilities the wartime industrial demands resulting in a supply shortage of such things as steel and other metals in turn leading to the adoption of new materials and advancement or novel use of old ones similarly surplus postwar industrial capacity accelerated the use of new materials and techniques particular architectural aluminium as a result of advances made in its use in aircraft etc during the war at the same time there was a rapid demand for structures during the war such as military and governmental facilities as well as for housing after the war these factors encouraged experiments with prefabricated building though examples of prefabrication have existed since the beginning of the industrial revolution with notable examples during the interwar period such as the diner the semi-circular metal nissen hut of world war i revived as the quonset hut the post-war enameled-steel lustron house 1947–1950 and buckminster fullers experimental aluminum dymaxion house international style 1945-1960 main article international style architecture in 1932 prior to world war ii the international exhibition of modern architecture was held at the museum of modern art in new york city philip johnson and collaborator henry-russell hitchcock drew together many distinct threads and trends in architecture identified them as stylistically similar and having a common purpose and consolidated them into the international style this was a turning point however for the remainder of the interwar period the moderne styles overshadowed this movement with the labeling of modernist art and architecture in germany as degenerate followed by world war ii important figures of the bauhaus and new objectivity fled to the united states marcel breuer and walter gropius went to the harvard graduate school of design the former becoming part of a group known as the harvard five ludwig mies van der rohe to chicago with others going to black mountain college still others fled to british palestine contributing to the design of the white city of tel aviv while high-style modernist architectural design never became dominant in single-dwelling residential buildings in the united states in institutional and commercial architecture modernism became the pre-eminent and in the schools for leaders of the architectural profession the only acceptable design solution from about 1932 to about 1984 architects who worked in the international style wanted to break with architectural tradition and design simple unornamented buildings the most commonly used materials are glass for the facade usually a curtain wall steel for exterior support and concrete for the floors and interior supports floor plans were functional and logical the style became most evident in the design of skyscrapers perhaps its most famous manifestations include the united nations headquarters le corbusier oscar niemeyer sir howard robertson the seagram building and the toronto-dominion centre ludwig mies van der rohe and lever house skidmore owings merrill in the united states a prominent early residential example was the lovell house in los angeles designed by austrian expatriate richard neutra in the 1920s other examples include the case study houses commissioned between 1945 and 1966 the twenty or so homes that were built primarily in and around los angeles designed by architects such as neutra and americans charles and ray eames the eames house have attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors since their completion and have influenced many architects over the years notably the british architect michael manser whose domestic work is best exemplified by capel manor house in kent these and other modern residences tend to focus on humanizing the otherwise harsh ideal making them more livable and ultimately more appealing to real people many of these designs use a similar tactic blurring the line between indoor and outdoor spaces this is achieved by embracing the box while at the same time dissolving it into the background with minimal structure and large glass walls as was particularly the case with the farnsworth house by mies van der rohe and the glass house by philip johnson the later part of a set of residences by the harvard five in new canaan connecticut some critics claim that these spaces remain too cold and static for the average person to function however the materials utilized in a large number of modern homes are not hidden behind a softening facade while this may make them somewhat less desirable for the general public most modernist architects see this as a necessary and pivotal tenet of modernism uncluttered and purely minimal design urban design and mass housing main articles congrès international darchitecture moderne and athens charter see also urban renewal during the interwar period high-quality architecture was built on a large scale in some growing european cities including berlin frankfurt vienna and rotterdam for broad sections of the population including poorer people in particular the berlin housing estates built before the beginning of national socialism set standards worldwide they are seen right up to today as a major political and organisational achievement and therefore have been added to the unesco world heritage list in 2008 as a result of the economically difficult situation during the weimar republic housing construction which up to that time had been mainly privately financed and profit-oriented had found itself at a dead end inflation was on the up and for citizens on low incomes decent housing was becoming increasingly unaffordable consequently the search was on to find new models for state-initiated housing construction which could then be implemented with a passion from 1920 on following the creation of greater berlin and the accompanying reform of local and regional government the requirements for the type of flats to be built and the facilities they were to have were clearly defined and the city was divided into different building zones following some basic ideas of the garden city movement two to three-storey housing estates that were well integrated into the landscape of the suburbs of the city were planned the first large estate of this type with more than 2,000 residential units was the so-called hufeisensiedlung horseshoe estate designed by bruno taut in berlin after world war ii the congrès internationaux darchitecture moderne ciam was a force in shaping modernist urban planning and consequently the design of cities and the structures within from 1928 to 1959 its 1933 meeting resulted in the basis of what became the athens charter which would drive urban planning practice for much of the mid-20th century following its principles in the late 1950s the entirely-new city of brasília was built as a new capital for brazil designed by lucio costa with prominent works for it designed by oscar niemeyer le corbusier applied ciams principles in his design for the city of chandigarh in india the devastation that wwii wrought in europe asia and the pacific and subsequent post-war housing shortages resulted in a vast building and rebuilding of cities with a variety of techniques employed for the creation of mass-housing one attempt to solve this was by using the tower block in the eastern bloc mass housing took the form of prefabricated panel buildings such as the plattenbau of east germany khrushchyovka of russia and the panelák of czechoslovakia mid-century reactions further information mid-century modern as the international style took hold others architects reacted to or strayed from its purely functionalist forms while at the same time retaining highly modernist characteristics eero saarinen alvar aalto and oscar niemeyer were three of the most prolific architects and designers in this movement which has influenced contemporary modernism le corbusier once described buildings as machines for living but people are not machines and it was suggested that they do not want to live in machines during the middle of the century some architects began experimenting in organic forms that they felt were more human and accessible mid-century modernism or organic modernism was very popular due to its democratic and playful nature expressionist exploration of form was revived such as in the sydney opera house in australia by jørn utzon eero saarinen invoked suggestions of flight in his designs for the terminal at dulles international airport outside of washington d.c or the twa terminal in new york both finished in 1962 the mission 66 project of the united states national park service was also built during this time contributing to these expressions were structural advances that enabled new forms to be possible or desirable félix candela a spanish expatriate living in mexico and italian engineer pier luigi nervi made particular strides in the use of reinforced concrete and concrete shell construction in 1954 buckminster fuller patented the geodesic dome another stylistic reaction was new formalism or neo-formalism sometimes shortened to formalism like the pre-war stripped classicism new formalism blended elements of classicism at their most abstracted levels with modernist designs characteristics drawing on classicism include rigid symmetry use of columns and colonnades or arcades and use of high-end materials such as marble or granite yet works in this vein also characteristically use the flat roofs common with the international style architects working in this mode included edward durrell stone minoru yamasaki and some of the middle-period work of philip johnson with examples in the united states including the kennedy center 1971 and the national museum of american history 1964 in washington d.c and the lincoln center for the performing arts mid-1960s in new york arising shortly after the end of world war ii a particular set of stylistic tendencies in the united states during this time is known as googie or populuxe derived from futuristic visions inspired by the imagery of the atomic age and space age with motifs such as atomic orbital patterns and flying saucers respectively such as in the space needle in seattle though the style was unique to the united states similar iconography can be seen in the atomium in brussels a distinctly mexican take on modernism plastic integration was a syncretization of mexican artistic traditions such as muralism with international style forms and can be seen in the later works of luis barragán and juan ogorman epitomized by the ciudad universitaria of unam in mexico city brutalism and monumentality main article brutalist architecture architects such as louis kahn paul rudolph marcel breuer i.m pei and others responded to the light glass curtain walls advocated by ludwig mies van der rohe by creating architecture with an emphasis on more substantial materials such as concrete and brick and creating works with a monumental quality brutalism is a term derived from the use of béton brut raw concrete unadorned often with the mold marks remaining though as a stylistic tendency brutalism would ultimately be applied more broadly to include the use of other materials such as brickwork in a similar fashion the term was first used in architecture by le corbusier late 20th-century reactions and movements high-tech architecture further information high-tech architecture high-tech architecture also known as late modernism or structural expressionism is an architectural style that emerged in the 1970s incorporating elements of high-tech industry and technology into building design high-tech architecture appeared as a revamped modernism an extension of those previous ideas helped by even more technological advances this category serves as a bridge between modernism and post-modernism however there remain gray areas as to where one category ends and the other begins in the 1980s high-tech architecture became more difficult to distinguish from post-modern architecture some of its themes and ideas were later absorbed into the style of neo-futurism art and architectural movement postmodern architecture main article postmodern architecture modern architecture met with some criticism which began in the 1960s on the grounds that it seemed universal elitist and lacked meaning siegfried giedion in the 1961 introduction to his evolving text space time and architecture first written in 1941 began at the moment a certain confusion exists in contemporary architecture as in painting a kind of pause even a kind of exhaustion at the metropolitan museum of art a 1961 symposium discussed the question modern architecture death or metamorphosis the loss of traditionalist structures to make way for new modernist construction especially via the urban renewal movement led to further criticism particularly the demolition of new york penn station in 1963 that same year controversy materialized around the pan am building that loomed over grand central terminal taking advantage of the modernist real estate concept of air rights in criticism by ada louise huxtable and douglass haskell it was seen to sever the park avenue streetscape and tarnish the reputations of its consortium of architects walter gropius pietro belluschi and the builders emery roth sons the proposal for a tower over the terminal itself resulted in the landmark u.s supreme court case penn central transportation co v new york city upholding the citys landmark laws alongside these preservation efforts came the increasing respectability and fashionability of more traditional styles architects explored postmodern architecture which offered a blend of some pre-modern elements and deliberately sought to move away from rectilinear designs towards more eclectic styles even philip johnson came to admit that he was bored with the box by the 1980s postmodern architecture appeared to trend over modernism high postmodern aesthetics lacked traction and by the mid-1990s a new surge of modern architecture once again established international pre-eminence as part of this revival much of the criticism of the modernists was re-evaluated and a modernistic style once again dominates in institutional and commercial contemporary practice although modern and postmodern design compete with a revival of traditional architectural design in commercial and institutional architecture residential design continues to be dominated by a traditional aesthetic neomodern architecture further information neomodern neomodernism is a reaction to postmodernism and its embrace of pre-modern elements of design examples of modern architecture

neofuturist urbanists architects designers and artists believe in cities releasing emotions driven by eco-sustainability and ethical values and implementing new materials and new technologies to provide a better quality of life for residents pioneered from early 60s and late 70s by finnish american architect eero saarinen american architect adrian wilson and charles luckman danish architects henning larsen and jørn utzon the architectural movement was later named neo-futurism by french architect denis laming he designed all of the buildings in futuroscope whose kinemax is the flagship building in the early 21st century neo-futurism has been relaunched in december 2006 by innovation designer vito di bari with the futuristic vision for the city of milan at the time of the universal expo 2015 included in the candidature presented to bie bureau of international expositions and envisioning the convergence of art cutting edge technologies and ethical values later defined by spanish architect santiago calatrava as a fusion of architecture art and engineering and by danish architect bjarke ingels as a pragmatic utopian architecture that takes on the creation of socially and environmentally perfect places architects working in this mode include pritzker architecture prize iraqi-british architect zaha hadid and japanese ryue nishizawa lubetkin prize winner british thomas heatherwick spanish architects santiago calatrava fermín vázquez and enric massip-bosch and artists such as indian sculptor anish kapoor italian large-scale buildings artist mario arlati and dutch kinetic sculptor theo jansen new urbanism and new classical architecture concurrently the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design this in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl both trends started in the 1980s the driehaus architecture prize is an award that recognizes efforts in new urbanism and new classical architecture and is endowed
