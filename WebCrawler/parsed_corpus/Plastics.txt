redirects here for the album by the buggles see the age of plastic iupac definition generic term used in the case of polymeric material that may contain other substances to improve performance andor reduce costs note 1 the use of this term instead of polymer is a source of confusion and thus is not recommended note 2 this term is used in polymer engineering for materials often compounded that can be processed by flow plastic is a material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and can be molded into solid objects plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass but they often contain other substances they are usually synthetic most commonly derived from petrochemicals but many are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters plasticity is the general property of all materials that are able to irreversibly deform without breaking but this occurs to such a degree with this class of moldable polymers that their name is an emphasis on this ability due to their relatively low cost ease of manufacture versatility and imperviousness to water plastics are used in an enormous and expanding range of products from paper clips to spaceships they have already displaced many traditional materials such as wood stone horn and bone leather paper metal glass and ceramic in most of their former uses in developed countries about a third of plastic is used in packaging and another third in buildings such as piping used in plumbing or vinyl siding other uses include automobiles up to 20 plastic furniture and toys in the developing world the ratios may be different  for example reportedly 42 of indias consumption is used in packaging plastics have many uses in the medical field as well to include polymer implants however the field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic material but rather the more generic meaning of the word plasticity in regards to the reshaping of flesh the worlds first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite invented in new york in 1907 by leo baekeland who coined the term plastics many chemists contributed to the materials science of plastics including nobel laureate hermann staudinger who has been called the father of polymer chemistry and herman mark known as the father of polymer physics the success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of very large molecules toward the end of the century one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling etymology the word plastic is derived from the greek πλαστικός plastikos meaning capable of being shaped or molded from πλαστός plastos meaning molded it refers to their malleability or plasticity during manufacture that allows them to be cast pressed or extruded into a variety of shapes—such as films fibers plates tubes bottles boxes and much more the common word plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective plastic which is applied to any material which undergoes a permanent change of shape plastic deformation when strained beyond a certain point aluminum which is stamped or forged for instance exhibits plasticity in this sense but is not plastic in the common sense in contrast in their finished forms some plastics will break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense common plastics and uses polyester pes –

materials e.g chewing gum shellac to the use of chemically modified natural materials e.g natural rubber nitrocellulose collagen galalite and finally to completely synthetic molecules e.g bakelite epoxy polyvinyl chloride early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins which are organic polymers in 1600 bc mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls bands and figurines treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the middle ages materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk-proteins casein with lye in the 1800s as industrial chemistry developed during the industrial revolution many materials were reported the development of plastics also accelerated with charles goodyears discovery of vulcanization to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber parkesine is considered the first man-made plastic the plastic material was patented by alexander parkes in birmingham uk in 1856 it was unveiled at the 1862 great international exhibition in london parkesine won a bronze medal at the 1862 worlds fair in london parkesine was made from cellulose the major component of plant cell walls treated with nitric acid as a solvent the output of the process commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated by incorporating pigments into the product it could be made to resemble ivory in 1897 the hanover germany mass printing press owner wilhelm krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards the resultant horn-like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the austrian chemist friedrich adolph spitteler 1846–1940 the final result was unsuitable for the original purpose in 1893 french chemist auguste trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde producing material marketed as galalith in the early 1900s bakelite the first fully synthetic thermoset was reported by belgian chemist leo baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde after world war i improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s around world war ii among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene ps first produced by basf in the 1930s and polyvinyl chloride pvc first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s in 1923 durite plastics inc was the first manufacturer of phenol-furfural resins in 1933 polyethylene was discovered by imperial chemical industries ici researchers reginald gibson and eric fawcett in 1954 polypropylene was discovered by giulio natta and began to be manufactured in 1957 in 1954 expanded polystyrene used for building insulation packaging and cups was invented by dow chemical polyethylene terephthalate pets discovery is credited to employees of the calico printers association in the uk in 1941 it was licensed to dupont for the usa and ici otherwise and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances resulting in widespread use for bottles in europe composition most plastics contain organic polymers the vast majority of these polymers are based on chains of carbon atoms alone or with oxygen sulfur or nitrogen as well the backbone is that part of the chain on the main path linking a large number of repeat units together to customize the properties of a plastic different molecular groups hang from the backbone usually they are hung as part of the monomers before the monomers are linked together to form the polymer chain the structure of these side chains influence the properties of the polymer this fine tuning of the repeating units molecular structure influences the properties of the polymer most plastics contain other organic or inorganic compounds blended in the amount of additives ranges from zero percentage for example in polymers used to wrap foods to more than 50 for certain electronic applications the average content of additives is 20 by weight of the polymer many of the controversies associated with plastics are associated with the additives organotin compounds are particularly toxic fillers fillers improve performance andor reduce production costs stabilizing additives include fire retardants to lower the flammability of the material many plastics contain fillers relatively inert and inexpensive materials that make the product cheaper by weight typically fillers are mineral in origin e.g chalk some fillers are more chemically active and are called reinforcing agents other fillers include zinc oxide wood flour ivory dust cellulose and starch plasticizers since many organic polymers are too rigid for particular applications they are blended with plasticizers the largest group of additives oily compounds that confer improved rheology colorants colorants are common additives although their weight contribution is small classification plastics are usually classified by their chemical structure of the polymers backbone and side chains some important groups in these classifications are the acrylics polyesters silicones polyurethanes and halogenated plastics plastics can also be classified by the chemical process used in their synthesis such as condensation polyaddition and cross-linking thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers there are two types of plastics thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers thermoplastics are the plastics that do not undergo chemical change in their composition when heated and can be molded again and again examples include polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride common thermoplastics range from 20,000 to 500,000 amu while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight these chains are made up of many repeating molecular units known as repeat units derived from monomers each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units thermosets can melt and take shape once after they have solidified they stay solid in the thermosetting process a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible the vulcanization of rubber is a thermosetting process before heating with sulfur the polyisoprene is a tacky slightly runny material but after vulcanization the product is rigid and non-tacky other classifications other classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or product design examples of such classes are the thermoplastic and thermoset elastomer structural biodegradable and electrically conductive plastics can also be classified by various physical properties such as density tensile strength glass transition temperature and resistance to various chemical products biodegradability main article biodegradable plastic biodegradable plastics break down degrade upon exposure to sunlight e.g ultra-violet radiation water or dampness bacteria enzymes wind abrasion and in some instances rodent pest or insect attack are also included as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation some modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems starch powder has been mixed with plastic as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily but it still does not lead to complete breakdown of the plastic some researchers have actually genetically engineered bacteria that synthesize a completely biodegradable plastic but this material such as biopol is expensive at present companies have made biodegradable additives to enhance the biodegradation of plastics natural vs synthetic main article bioplastic most plastics are produced from petrochemicals motivated by the finiteness of petrochemical reserves and threat of global warming bioplastics are being developed bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials such as cellulose and starch in comparison to the global consumption of all flexible packaging estimated at 12.3 million tonnesyear estimates put global production capacity at 327,000 tonnesyear for related bio-derived materials crystalline vs amorphous some plastics are partially crystalline and partially amorphous in molecular structure giving them both a melting point the temperature at which the attractive intermolecular forces are overcome and one or more glass transitions temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased the so-called semi-crystalline plastics include polyethylene polypropylene poly vinyl chloride polyamides nylons polyesters and some polyurethanes many plastics are completely amorphous such as polystyrene and its copolymers poly methyl methacrylate and all thermosets representative polymers bakelite main article bakelite the first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907 by leo hendrik baekeland a belgian-born american living in new york state baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators he found that combining phenol c6h5oh and formaldehyde hcoh formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour asbestos or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant composite materials the new material tended to foam during synthesis requiring that baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth uniform product as he announced in 1909 in a meeting of the american chemical society bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s bakelite was a purely synthetic material not derived from living matter it was also an early thermosetting plastic polystyrene main articles polystyrene and pvc unplasticised polystyrene is a rigid brittle inexpensive plastic that has been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick-knacks it also is the basis for some of the most popular foamed plastics under the name styrene foam or styrofoam like most other foam plastics foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an open cell form in which the foam bubbles are interconnected as in an absorbent sponge and closed cell in which all the bubbles are distinct like tiny balloons as in gas-filled foam insulation and flotation devices in the late 1950s high impact styrene was introduced which was not brittle it finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties polyvinyl chloride polyvinyl chloride pvc commonly called vinyl incorporates chlorine atoms the c-cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation and burning pvc is stiff strong heat and weather resistant properties that recommend its use in devices for plumbing gutters house siding enclosures for computers and other electronics gear pvc can also be softened with chemical processing and in this form it is now used for shrink-wrap food packaging and rain gear all pvc polymers are degraded by heat and light when this happens hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver photographic film or paper mylar is preferable nylon main article nylon the plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of polyamide pa far better known by its trade name nylon nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber introduced by dupont corporation at the 1939 worlds fair in new york city in 1927 dupont had begun a secret development project designated fiber66 under the direction of harvard chemist wallace carothers and chemistry department director elmer keiser bolton carothers had been hired to perform pure research and he worked to understand the new materials molecular structure and physical properties he took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials his work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber which was very strong but also very flexible the first application was for bristles for toothbrushes however du ponts real target was silk particularly silk stockings carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide 6.6 and 4.6 as well as polyesters it took dupont twelve years and us27 million to refine nylon and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture with such a major investment it was no surprise that du pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction creating a public sensation or nylon mania nylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the usa entered world war ii the production capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings or just nylons for american women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers after the war ended dupont went back to selling nylon to the public engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze triggering the so-called nylon riots subsequently polyamides 6 10 11 and 12 have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds e.g caprolactam nylon 66 is a material manufactured by condensation polymerization nylons still remain important plastics and not just for use in fabrics in its bulk form it is very wear resistant particularly if oil-impregnated and so is used to build gears plain bearings valve seats seals and because of good heat-resistance increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars and other mechanical parts polymethyl methacrylate main article polymethyl methacrylate polymethyl methacrylate pmma also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names plexiglas acrylite lucite and perspex among several others see below is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass the same material can be utilised as a casting resin in inks and coatings and has many other uses rubber natural rubber is an elastomer an elastic hydrocarbon polymer that originally was derived from latex a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants it is useful directly in this form indeed the first appearance of rubber in europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from brazil however in 1839 charles goodyear invented vulcanized rubber a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur and a few other chemicals forming cross-links between polymer chains vulcanization improving elasticity and durability in 1851 nelson goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form ebonite synthetic rubber main article synthetic rubber the first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by sergei lebedev in 1910 in world war ii supply blockades of natural rubber from south east asia caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber notably styrene-butadiene rubber in 1941 annual production of synthetic rubber in the u.s was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840,000 tonnes in 1945 in the space race and nuclear arms race caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets ultimately all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort properties of plastics the properties of plastics are defined chiefly by the organic chemistry of the polymer such as hardness density and resistance to heat organic solvents oxidation and ionizing radiation in particular most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees celsius while plastics can be made electrically conductive with the conductivity of up to 80 kscm in stretch-oriented polyacetylene they are still no match for most metals like copper which have conductivities of several hundreds kscm ul standards many properties of plastics are determined by tests as specified by underwriters laboratories such as flammability  ul94 high voltage arc tracking rate  ul746a comparative tracking index iso many properties of plastics are determined by standards as specified by iso such as iso 306  thermoplastics toxicity pure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert due to a large molecular weight plastic products contain a variety of additives some of which can be toxic for example plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging toys and many other items traces of these compounds can leach out of the product owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates the european union has restricted the use of dehp di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and other phthalates in some applications and the united states has limited the use of dehp dpb bbp dinp didp and dnop in childrens toys and child care articles with the consumer product safety improvement act some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols whereas the finished plastic may be non-toxic the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic in some cases small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed for example the world health organizations international agency for research on cancer iarc has recognized vinyl chloride the precursor to pvc as a human carcinogen bisphenol a some polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated in 2011 it was reported that almost all plastic products sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity the primary building block of polycarbonates bisphenol a bpa is an estrogen-like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food research in environmental health perspectives finds that bpa leached from the lining of tin cans dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals offspring a more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to bpa results in insulin resistance which can lead to inflammation and heart disease as of january 2010 the la times newspaper reports that the united states fda is spending 30 million to investigate indications of bpa being linked to cancer bis2-ethylhexyl adipate present in plastic wrap based on pvc is also of concern as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell the european union has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys in 2009 the united states government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic environmental effects see also plastic pollution marine debris and great pacific garbage patch most plastics are durable and degrade very slowly the very chemical bonds that make them so durable tend to make them resistant to most natural processes of degradation however microbial species and communities capable of degrading plastics are discovered from time to time and some show promise as being useful for bioremediating certain classes of plastic waste in 1975 a team of japanese scientists studying ponds containing waste water from a nylon factory discovered a strain of flavobacterium that digested certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture such as the linear dimer of 6-aminohexanoate nylon 4 or polybutyrolactam can be degraded by the nd-10 and nd-11 strands of pseudomonas sp found in sludge this produced γ-aminobutyric acid gaba as a byproduct several species of soil fungi can consume polyurethane this includes two species of the ecuadorian fungus pestalotiopsis that can consume polyurethane aerobically and also in anaerobic conditions such as those at the bottom of landfills methanogenic consortia degrade styrene using it as a carbon source pseudomonas putida can convert styrene oil into various biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch have been shown to capable of degrading polypropylene the fungus aspergillus fumigatus effectively degrades plasticized pvc phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown on pvc in a mineral salt agar phanerochaete chrysosporium lentinus tigrinus aspergillus niger and aspergillus sydowii can also effectively degrade pvc phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown on pvc in a mineral salt agar acinetobacter has been found to partially degrade low molecular weight polyethylene oligomers when used in combination pseudomonas fluorescens and sphingomonas can degrade over 40 of the weight of plastic bags in less than three months the thermophilic bacterium brevibacillus borstelensis strain 707 was isolated from a soil sample and found capable of using low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated at 50 degrees celsius pre-exposure of the plastic to ultraviolet radiation broke chemical bonds and aided biodegradation the longer the period of uv exposure the greater the promotion of the degradation less desirably hazardous molds have been found aboard space stations molds that degrade rubber into a digestible form several species of yeasts bacteria algae and lichens have been found growing on synthetic polymer artifacts in museums and at archaeological sites in the plastic-polluted waters of the sargasso sea bacteria have been found that consume various types of plastic however it is unknown to what extent these bacteria effectively clean up poisons rather than simply releasing them into the marine microbial ecosystem plastic eating microbes also have been found in landfills nocardia can degrade pet with an esterase enzyme the fungi geotrichum candidum found in belize has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic found in cds phenol-formaldehyde commonly known as bakelite is degraded by the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium the futuro house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyesters polyester-polyurethane and polymethylmethacrylate one such house was found to be harmfully degraded by cyanobacteria and archaea since the 1950s one billion tons of plastic have been discarded and some of that material might persist for centuries or much longer as is demonstrated by the persistence of natural materials such as amber serious environmental threats from plastic have been suggested in the light of the increasing presence of microplastics in the marine food chain along with many highly toxic chemical pollutants that accumulate in plastics they also accumulate in larger fragmented pieces of plastic called nurdles in the 1960s the latter were observed in the guts of seabirds and since then have been found in increasing concentration in 2009 it was estimated that 10 of modern waste was plastics although estimates vary according to region meanwhile 50-80 of debris in marine areas is plastic before the ban on the use of cfcs in extrusion of polystyrene and in general use except in life-critical fire suppression systems see montreal protocol the production of polystyrene contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer but current extrusion processes use non-cfcs climate change the effect of plastics on global warming is mixed plastics are generally made from petroleum if the plastic is incinerated it increases carbon emissions if it is placed in a landfill it becomes a carbon sink although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal plastic may reduce energy consumption for example packaging beverages in pet plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52 in transportation energy production of plastics production of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 mj of energy per kilogram taking into account the average efficiency of us utility stations of 35 producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming 230 to 235 mj per 1 kilogram of silicon and about 3,000 mj per kilogram of semiconductors this is much higher compared to many other materials e.g production of iron from iron ore requires 20-25 mj of energy glass from sand etc  18-35 mj steel from iron  20-50 mj paper from timber  25-50 mj per kilogram incineration of plastics controlled high-temperature incineration above 850c for two seconds performed with selective additional heating breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further this is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins a carcinogen cancer causing chemical the problem occurs as the heat content of the waste stream varies open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures and normally releases such toxic fumes pyrolytic disposal plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels since plastics have hydrogen and carbon one kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon recycling main article plastic recycling thermoplastics can be remelted and reused and thermoset plastics can be ground up and used as filler although the purity of the material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle there are methods by which plastics can be broken back down to a feedstock state the greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes making it labor-intensive typically workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory typically the caps for pete bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable which presents additional problems to the automated sorting process other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically however new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling while containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic making them relatively easy to be sorted a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics in such cases the resources it would take to separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded however developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly which may result in more consumer product components being re-used or recycled recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well for example polystyrene is rarely recycled because it is usually not cost effective these unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste-to-energy plants a first success in recycling of plastics is vinyloop a recycling process and an approach of the industry to separate pvc from other materials through a process of dissolution filtration and separation of contaminations a solvent is used in a closed loop to elute pvc from the waste this makes it possible to recycle composite structure pvc waste which normally is being incinerated or put in a landfill vinyloop-based recycled pvcs primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced pvc the global warming potential is 39 percent lower this is why the use of recycled material leads to a significant better ecological footprint this process was used after the olympic games in london 2012 parts of temporary buildings like the water polo arena or the royal artillery barracks were recycled this way the pvc policy could be fulfilled which says that no pvc waste should be left after the games in 1988 to assist recycling of disposable items the plastic bottle institute of the society of the plastics industry devised a now-familiar scheme to mark plastic bottles by plastic type a plastic container using this scheme is marked with a triangle of three chasing arrows which encloses a number giving the plastic type polyethylene terephthalate pet or pete high-density polyethylene hdpe polyvinyl chloride pvc low-density polyethylene ldpe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps other types of plastics see list below industry main articles chemical industry and plastics industry plastic manufacturing is a major part of the chemical industry and some of largest chemical companies internationally became involved early in the industry such as industry leaders basf and dow chemical in 2014 sales of the top fifty companies amounted to us961,300,000,000 basf was the worlds largest chemical producer for the ninth year in a row more than half of the companies on the list were headquartered in the united states twelve japan
