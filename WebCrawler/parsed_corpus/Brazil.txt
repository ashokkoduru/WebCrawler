with some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power one of the worlds major breadbaskets brazil has been the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years etymology main article name of brazil it is likely that the word brazil comes from the portuguese word for brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from latin brasa ember and the suffix il from iculum or ilium as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders mostly portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross terra da santa cruz but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil terra do brasil on account of the brazilwood trade the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name early sailors sometimes also called it the land of parrots terra di papaga in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees history main article history of brazil pre-cabraline era main article history of brazil § precolonial history the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago 6000 bc the pottery was found near santarém and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups e.g the tupis guaranis gês and arawaks the tupí people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambás and there were also many subdivision of the other groups before the arrival of europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations portuguese colonization main article colonial brazil the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro Álvares cabral the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupi–guarani family and fought among themselves though the first settlement was founded in 1532 colonization was effectively begun in 1534 when king dom joão iii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazils most important exportation product and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colonys economy fostering a brazilian gold rush which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s in maranhão during the 1610s and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutch–portuguese war after the end of iberian union the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugals wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy united kingdom with portugal main article united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves in late 1807 spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal causing prince regent joão in the name of queen maria i to move the royal court from lisbon to brazil there they established some of brazils first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges and its national bank additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations in 1809 in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joão return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815 in order to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the past six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state however such a ploy didnt last long since the leadership in portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820 as well as groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as showed by the 1817 pernambucan revolt in 1821 as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto d joão vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore oath to the new constitution leaving his son prince pedro de alcântara as regent of the kingdom of brazil independent empire main articles independence of brazil and empire of brazil tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased and the portuguese cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution tried to re-establish brazil as a colony the brazilians refused to yield and prince pedro decided to stand with them declaring the countrys independence from portugal on 7 september 1822 a month later prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil with the regnal title of dom pedro i resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil the brazilian war of independence which had already begun along this process spread through northern northeastern regions and in cisplatina province with the last portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 march 1824 portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825 on 7 april 1831 worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi pedro i went to portugal to reclaim his daughters crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir who thus became the empires second monarch with the regnal title of dom pedro ii as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national assembly in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place as the cabanagem the malê revolt the balaiada the sabinada and the ragamuffin war which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt was overcome only at the end of the 1840s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841 during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedro ii these were the platine war the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war the largest war effort in brazilian history on 15 november 1889 worn out by years of economic stagnation in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites for different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup early republic main articles first brazilian republic estado novo brazil and second brazilian republic the early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power in 1894 following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the republican civilians rose to power little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate getúlio vargas supported by most of the military successfully led the brazilian revolution of 1930 vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed the congress extinguished the constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with his own supporters in the 1930s three major attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred the first was the failed constitutionalist revolution of 1932 the second was the anti-fascist brazilian uprising of 1935 led by communists and the fascist integralist movement attempted a coup in may 1938 the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive the 1937 coup détat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election installed vargas as a dictator and began the estado novo era noted for government brutality and censorship of the press in foreign policy the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nations after its involvement in world war i in world war ii brazil remained neutral until august 1942 when the country entered on the allied side after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with axis powers in the wake of the pan-american conference with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargass position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy being reinstated by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950 contemporary era main articles brazilian military government and history of brazil since 1985 several brief interim governments succeeded after vargass suicide juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of brasília inaugurated in 1960 his successor was jânio quadros who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office his vice-president joão goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime the new regime was intended to be transitory but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968 the oppression was not limited to only those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society inside and outside the country through the infamous operation condor despite its brutality like other totalitarian regimes in history due to an economic boom known as an economic miracle the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and golbery with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979 brazil began its slow return to democracy which would be completed during the 1980s civilians returned to power in 1985 when josé sarney assumed the presidency becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime sarneys unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown fernando collor who was subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso as minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998 the peaceful transition of power from fernando henrique to his main opposition leader luiz inácio lula da silva elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006 was seen as a proof that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability however sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades against corruption police brutality inefficiencies of political establishment and public service numerous peaceful protests erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff who succeeded lula in 2010 enhanced by a political and economic crises with evidences of involvement of politicians from all main

in the south and tropical savannas in central brazil many regions have starkly different microclimates an equatorial climate characterizes much of northern brazil there is no real dry season but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls temperatures average 25 °c 77 °f with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons over central brazil rainfall is more seasonal characteristic of a savanna climate this region is as extensive as the amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude in the interior northeast seasonal rainfall is even more extreme the semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres 31.5 in of rain most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this creating long periods of drought brazils 1877–78 grande seca great drought the worst in brazils history caused approximately half a
