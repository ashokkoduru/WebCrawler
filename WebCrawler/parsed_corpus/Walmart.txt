economics at iowa state university found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a walmart store opening however in another study he compared the changes to what small town shops had faced in the past – including the development of the railroads the advent of the sears roebuck catalog as well as the arrival of shopping malls – and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after walmart arrives a later study in collaboration with mississippi state university showed that there are both positive and negative impacts on existing stores in the area where the new supercenter locates in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in september 2005 walmart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the

street journal that the company would be able to start opening walmart stores in india within two years expansion into india faced some significant problems in november 2012 walmart admitted to spending us25 million lobbying the indian national congress‍—‌lobbying is conventionally considered bribery in india walmart is conducting an internal investigation into potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act bharti walmart suspended a number of employees rumored to include its cfo and legal team to ensure a complete and thorough investigation as of september 30 2016 there are 21 best price locations in october 2013 bharti and walmart separated to pursue businesses independently setbacks in the mid-1990s walmart tried with a large financial investment to get a foothold in the german retail market in 1997 walmart took over the supermarket chain wertkauf with its 21 stores for dem750 million and in 1998 walmart acquired 74 interspar stores for dem1.3 billion the german market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among companies which used a similar low price strategy as walmart as a result walmarts low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage also walmarts corporate culture was not viewed positively among employees and customers particularly walmarts statement of ethics which restricted relationships between employees and led to a public discussion in the media resulting in a bad reputation among customers in july 2006 walmart announced its withdrawal from germany due to sustained losses the stores were sold to the german company metro during walmarts fiscal third quarter walmart did not disclose its losses from its german investment but they were estimated to be around €3 billion corruption charges an april 2012 investigative report by the new york times reported the allegations of a former executive of walmart de mexico that in september 2005 the company had paid bribes via local fixers to officials throughout mexico in exchange for construction permits information and other favors which gave walmart a substantial advantage over competitors walmart investigators found credible evidence that mexican and american laws had been broken concerns were also raised that walmart executives in the united states had hushed up the allegations a follow-up investigation by the new york times published december 17 2012 revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting construction and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery there was evidence that a bribe of us52,000 was paid to change a zoning map which enabled the opening of a walmart store a mile from a historical site in san juan teotihuacán in 2004 after the initial article was released walmart released a statement denying the allegations and describing its anti-corruption policy while an official walmart report states that it had found no evidence of corruption the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public forbes contributor adam hartung also commented that the bribery scandal was a reflection of walmarts serious management and strategy troubles stating scandals are now commonplace  each scandal points out that walmarts strategy is harder to navigate and is running into big problems as of december 2012 internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act walmart has invested us99 million on internal investigations which expanded beyond mexico to implicate operations in china brazil and india the case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by foreign financial and corporate interests sams club main article sams club sams club is a chain of warehouse clubs that sell groceries and general merchandise often in bulk they range from 71,000 to

manufacturers walmart began offering private label brands in 1991 with the launch of sams choice a line of drinks produced by cott beverages for walmart sams choice quickly became popular and by 1993 was the third most popular beverage brand in the united states other walmart brands include great value and equate in the u.s and canada and smart price in britain a 2006 study talked of the magnitude of mind-share walmart appears to hold in the shoppers minds when it comes to the awareness of private label brands and retailers entertainment in 2010 the company teamed with procter gamble to produce secrets of the mountain and the jensen project two-hour family movies which featured the characters using walmart and procter gamble branded products the jensen project also featured a preview of a

companys business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices doug mcmillon became walmarts ceo on february 1 2014 mcmillon began his walmart career in warehouses while in high school he has also worked as the head of sams club and walmart international the company refers to employees as associates all walmart stores in the u.s and canada also have designated greeters at the entrance a practice pioneered by sam walton and later imitated by other retailers greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions for many years associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest but this practice was discontinued in june 2007 and replaced with khaki pants and polo shirts the wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul to increase sales and rejuvenate the companys stock price in september 2014 the uniform was again updated to bring back a vest paid for by the company for store employees over the same polos and khaki or black pants paid for by the employee the vest is navy blue for walmart employees at supercenters and discount stores and lime green for walmart neighborhood market employees both state proud walmart associate on the left breast and the spark logo covering the back reportedly one of the main reasons the vest was reintroduced was because some customers had trouble identifying employees by requiring employees to wear uniforms that are made up of standard street wear walmart is not required to purchase or reimbursement employees which is required in some states as long as that clothing can be worn elsewhere businesses are only legally required to pay for branded shirts and pants or clothes that would be difficult to wear outside of work unlike many other retailers walmart does not charge slotting fees to suppliers for their products to appear in the store instead it focuses on selling more popular products and provides incentives for store managers to drop unpopular products on september 14 2006 the company announced that it would phase out its layaway program citing declining use and increased costs layaway ceased on november 19 2006 and required merchandise pickup by december 8 2006 walmart now focuses on other payment options such as increased use of six and twelve-month zero-interest financing the layaway location in most stores is now used for walmarts site-to-store program which was introduced in march 2007 this enables walmart.com customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup finance and governance for the fiscal year ending january 31 2015 walmart reported net income of us17 billion on us485.7 billion of revenue the companys international operations accounted for

department stores like kmart publix target shopko and meijer canadas the real canadian superstore and giant tiger and mexicos comercial mexicana and soriana competitors of walmarts sams club division are costco and the smaller bjs wholesale club chain walmarts move into the grocery business in the late 1990s also set it against major supermarket chains in both the united states and canada some retail analysts see regional grocery store chain winco foods as serious competition for walmart several smaller retailers primarily dollar stores such as family dollar and dollar general have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against walmart in 2004 walmart responded by testing its own dollar store concept a subsection of some stores called pennies-n-cents walmart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets for example in germany it had captured just 2 percent of the german food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained a secondary player behind aldi with 19 percent walmart continues to do well in the uk where its asda subsidiary is the second largest retailer in may 2006 after entering the south korean market in 1998 walmart sold all 16 of its south korean outlets to shinsegae a local retailer for us882 million shinsegae re-branded the walmarts as e-mart stores walmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas in china walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to chinese citizens for example it found that chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks leading to higher sales customer base walmart customers cite low prices as the most important reason for shopping there the average u.s walmart customers income is below the national average and analysts estimated that more than one-fifth of them lack a bank account twice the national rate a 2006 walmart report also indicated that walmart customers are sensitive to higher utility costs and gas prices a poll indicated that after the 2004 us presidential election 76 percent of voters who shopped at walmart once a week voted for george w bush while only 23 percent supported senator john kerry when measured against similar retailers in the u.s frequent walmart shoppers were rated the most politically conservative thus as of 2014 the majority 54 percent of americans who prefer shopping at walmart report that they oppose same-sex marriage while 40 percent are in favor of it due to its prominence in the bible belt walmart is known for its tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers walmart only carries clean versions of hip-hop audio cds and in cooperation with the timothy plan places plastic sheathes over suggestive womens periodicals and banned lad mags such as maxim magazine in addition walmart also caters to its christian customer base by selling christian books and media such as veggietales videos and the purpose-driven life which earns the company over us1 billion annually in 2006 walmart took steps to expand its u.s customer base announcing a modification in its u.s stores from a one-size-fits-all merchandising strategy to one designed to reflect each of six demographic groups – african-americans the affluent empty-nesters hispanics suburbanites and rural residents around six months later it unveiled a new slogan saving people money so they can live better lives this reflects the three main groups into which walmart categorizes its 200 million customers brand aspirationals people with low incomes who are obsessed with names like kitchenaid price-sensitive affluents wealthier shoppers who love deals and value-price shoppers people who like low prices and cannot afford much more walmart has also made steps to appeal to more liberal customers for example by rejecting the american family associations recommendations and carrying the dvd brokeback mountain a love story between two gay cowboys in wyoming technology open source software many walmart technology projects are coded in the open and available through the walmart labs github repository as open source software under the osi approved apache v2.0 license at the time of writing november 2016 141 public github projects are listed during a migration of the walmart.com retail platform to facebook react and node.js the electrode project was created to power the e-commerce platform which serves 80 million visitors per month and 15 million items electrode provides various developer enhancements and tools for the developer including node.js configuration and feature management alex grigoryan of walmart labs released a statement on medium.com 3rd october 2016 explaining the details of the applications and the scale that they operate at walmart big data analytics as the largest retailer in the u.s walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data the big data sets are mined for use in predictive analytics which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customers habits walmarts datacenter is unofficially referred to as area 71 in april 2011 walmart acquired kosmix to develop software for analyzing real-time data streams in august 2012 walmart announced its polaris search engine the amount of data gathered by walmart has raised privacy concerns charity sam walton believed that the companys contribution to society was the fact that it operated efficiently thereby lowering the cost of living for customers and therefore in that sense was a powerful force for good despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a handout he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education they could not be expected to solve every personal problem that comes to their attention he explained later in his autobiography we feel very strongly that wal-mart really is not and should not be in the charity business stating any debit has to be passed along to somebody‍—‌either shareholders or our customers since sam waltons death in 1992 however walmart and the walmart foundation dramatically increased charitable giving for example in 2005 walmart donated us20 million in cash and merchandise for hurricane katrina relief today walmarts charitable donations approach us1 billion each year economic impact kenneth stone professor of economics at iowa state university in a paper published in farm foundation in 1997 found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a walmart store opening he compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past‍—‌from the development of the railroads and the sears roebuck catalog to shopping malls he concludes that small towns are more affected by discount mass merchandiser stores than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever changing retail market can co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment one study found walmarts entry into a new market has a profound impact on its competition when a walmart opens in a new market median sales drop 40 percent at similar high-volume stores 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores according to a june 2009 study by researchers at several universities and led by the tuck school of business at dartmouth college a loyola university chicago study suggested that the impact a walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store the leader of that study admits that this factor is stronger in smaller towns and doesnt apply to more urban areas saying itd be so tough to nail down whats up with wal-mart these findings are underscored by another study conducted in 2009 by the national bureau of economics that showed large negative effects for competing businesses within five to ten miles of the new opening big box retailer this same study also found that the local retailers experience virtually no benefit this particularly contrasts with studies that find that local firms re-invest nearly 63 more of profits in other local businesses compared to chain retailers as found by the maine center of economic policy in 2011 walmart has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals including labor unions community groups grassroots organizations religious organizations environmental groups and the companys own customers and employees they have protested against the companys policies and business practices including charges of racial and gender discrimination other areas of criticism include the companys foreign product sourcing treatment of suppliers employee compensation and working conditions environmental practices the use of public subsidies the companys security policies and slavery walmart denies doing anything wrong and maintains that low prices are the result of efficiency a 2001 mckinsey global institute study of u.s labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 concluded that wal-mart directly and indirectly caused the bulk of the productivity acceleration in the retail sector robert solow a nobel laureate in economics and an adviser to the study stated that by far the most important factor in that growth is wal-mart the economic policy institute estimates that between 2001 and 2006 wal-marts trade deficit with china alone eliminated nearly 200,000 u.s jobs another study at the university of missouri found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by 100 jobs in the short term half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close a 2004 paper by two professors at pennsylvania state university found that u.s counties with walmart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without wal-marts they hypothesized that this could be due to the displacement of workers from higher-paid jobs in the retailers customers no longer choose to patronize wal-mart providing less local charity than the replaced businesses or a shrinking pool of local leadership and reduced social capital due to a reduced number of local independent businesses dr raj patel author of stuffed and starved markets power and the hidden battle for the world food system said in a lecture at the university of melbourne on september 18 2007 that a study in nebraska looked at two different wal-marts the first of which had just arrived and was in the process of driving everyone else out of business but to do that they cut their prices to the bone very very low prices in the other wal-mart they had successfully destroyed the local economy there was a sort of economic crater with wal-mart in the middle and in that community the prices were 17  percent higher a 2005 story in the washington post reported that wal-marts discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of american shoppers by at least us50 billion per year a study in 2005 at the massachusetts institute of technology mit measured the effect on consumer welfare and found that the poorest segment of the population benefits the most from the existence of discount retailers a june 2006 article published by the libertarian ludwig von mises institute suggested that wal-mart has a positive impact on small business it argued that while wal-marts low prices caused some existing businesses to close the chain also created new opportunities for other small business and so the process of creative destruction unleashed by wal-mart has no statistically significant impact on the overall size of the small business sector in the united states in 2006 american newspaper columnist george will named wal-mart the most prodigious job-creator in the history of the private sector in this galaxy and that by lowering consumer prices wal-mart costs about 50 retail jobs among competitors for every 100 jobs wal-mart creates in terms of economic effects will states that wal-mart and its effects save shoppers more than us200 billion a year dwarfing such government programs as food stamps us28.6 billion and the earned income tax credit us34.6 billion a 2014 story in the guardian reported that the wal-mart foundation was boosting its efforts to work with u.s manufacturers in february 2014 the walmart foundation pledged us10 billion to support domestic manufacturers and announced plans to buy us250 billion worth of american-made products in the next decade labor relations with over 2.2 million employees worldwide walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce these issues involve low wages poor working conditions inadequate health care as well as issues involving the companys strong anti-union policies in november 2013 the national labor relations board nlrb announced that it had found that in 13 u.s states wal-mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on black friday and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes critics point to walmarts high turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce although other factors may be involved approximately 70 percent of its employees leave within the first year despite this turnover rate the company is still able to affect unemployment rates this was found in a study by oklahoma state university which states walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account walmart is the largest private employer in the united states employing almost five times as many people as ibm the second largest employer walmart employs more african americans than any other private employer in the united states on february 23 2015 walmart announced that it is bumping its minimum wage to us10 an hour by february 2016 gender and sexual orientation in 2007 a gender discrimination lawsuit dukes v wal-mart stores inc was filed against walmart alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions a class action suit was sought which would have been the nations largest in history covering 1.5 million past and current employees on june 20 2011 the united states supreme court ruled in wal-marts favor stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class the court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs circumstances the class action could not proceed as presented and furthermore in a 5–4 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit several plaintiffs including the lead plaintiff betty dukes expressed their intent to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately according to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit in 2001 wal-marts eeoc filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of wal-marts hourly paid workforce but only 33 percent of its management just 35 percent of its store managers were women compared to 57 percent at similar retailers wal-mart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair because it classifies employees differently if department managers were included in the totals women would make up 60 percent of the managerial ranks others have criticized the lawsuit as without basis in the law and as an abuse of the class action mechanism in 2007 wal-mart was named by the national association for female executives as one of the top 35 companies for executive women wal-marts rating on the human rights campaigns corporate equality index a measure of how companies treat lgbt employees and customers has increased greatly during the past decade the company was praised for expanding its anti-discrimination policy protecting gay and lesbian employees as well as for a new definition of family that included same-sex partners however they have been criticized by the hrc in other areas such as not renewing its membership in the national gay and lesbian chamber of commerce in january 2006 wal-mart announced that diversity efforts include new groups of minority female and gay employees that meet at wal-mart headquarters in bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion there are seven business resource groups women african-americans hispanics asians native americans gays and lesbians and a disabled group animal welfare in april 2016 walmart announced that it plans to eliminate eggs from battery cages from its supply chain by 2025 the decision was particularly important because of walmarts large market share and influence on the rest of the industry the move was praised by major animal welfare groups and heralded as an end of an era by hsus president wayne pacelle but a poultry trade group representative expressed skepticism about the decisions impact walmarts cage-free eggs will not come from free range producers but rather industrial-scale farms where the birds will be alotted between 1 and 1.5 square feet each a stressful arrangement which can cause cannibalism unlike battery cages the systems walmarts suppliers will use allow the hens to move around but relative to battery cages they have higher hen mortality rates and present distinct environmental and worker health problems see also arkansas portal business and
