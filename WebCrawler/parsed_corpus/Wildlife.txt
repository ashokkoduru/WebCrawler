for other uses see wildlife disambiguation wild animals redirects here for the film see wild animals wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species but has come to include all plants fungi and other organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans wildlife can be found in all ecosystems deserts forests rain forests plains grasslands and other areas including the most developed urban sites all have distinct forms of wildlife while the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways including the legal social and moral sense some animals however have adapted to suburban environments this includes such animals as domesticated cats dogs mice and gerbils some religions declare certain animals to be sacred and in modern times concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment the global wildlife population has decreased by 52 percent between 1970 and 2014 according to a report by the world wildlife fund food pets and traditional medicines see also wildlife trade anthropologists believe that the stone age people and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife both plants and animals for their food in fact some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human hunters today hunting fishing and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world in other areas hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a sport or recreation with the edible meat as mostly a side benefit of it meat sourced from wildlife that is not traditionally regarded as game is known as bush meat the increasing demand for wildlife as a source of traditional food in east asia is decimating populations of sharks primates pangolins and other animals which they believe have aphrodisiac properties in november 2008 almost 900 plucked and oven-ready owls and other protected wildlife species were confiscated by the department of wildlife and national parks in malaysia according to traffic the animals were believed to be bound for china to be sold in wild meat restaurants most are listed in cites the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora which prohibits or restricts such trade a november 2008 report from biologist and author sally kneidel phd documented numerous wildlife species for sale in informal markets along the amazon river including wild-caught marmosets sold for as little as 1.60 5 peruvian soles many amazon species including peccaries agoutis turtles turtle eggs anacondas armadillos etc are sold primarily as food others in these informal markets such as monkeys and parrots are destined for the pet trade often smuggled into the united states still other amazon species are popular ingredients in traditional medicines sold in local markets the medicinal value of animal parts is based largely on superstition religion many animal species have spiritual significance in different cultures around the world and they and their products may be used as sacred objects in religious rituals for example eagles hawks and their feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to native americans as religious objects in hinduism the cow is regarded sacred muslims conduct sacrifices on eid-ul-adha to commemorate the sacrificial spirit of ibrahim abraham in love of god camels sheep goats and cows may be offered as sacrifice during the three days of eid tourism many nations have established their tourism sector around their natural wildlife south africa has for example many opportunities for tourists to see the countrys wildlife in its national parks such as the kruger park in south india the periar wildlife sanctuary bandipur national park and mudamalai wildlife sanctuary are situated around and in forests india is home to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries showing the diversity of its wildlife much of its unique fauna and excels in the range there are 89 national parks 13 bio reserves and more than 400 wildlife sanctuaries across india which are the best places to go to see tigers lions elephants rhinoceros birds and other wildlife which reflect the importance that the country places on nature and wildlife conservation destruction this subsection focuses on anthropogenic forms of wildlife destruction exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from africa 130,000 – 70,000 years ago the rate of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely believed that we are in the sixth great extinction event on this planet the holocene mass extinction destruction of wildlife does not always lead to an extinction of the species in question however the dramatic loss of entire species across earth dominates any review of wildlife destruction as extinction is the level of damage to a wild population from which there is no return the four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill habitat destruction and fragmentation impact of introduced species and chains of extinction overkill wildlife is an invaluable treasure but it is being exploited due to illegal trade of many of its species.overkill happens whenever hunting occurs at rates greater than the reproductive capacity of the population is being exploited the effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow growing populations such as many larger species of fish initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted an increased availability of resources food etc is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as density dependent inhibition is lowered hunting fishing and so on has lowered the competition between members of a population however if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young the population will begin to decrease in numbers populations that are confined to islands whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an “island” for the species concerned have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population declines following unsustainable hunting habitat destruction and fragmentation main articles habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation the habitat of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory many processes associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species in many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented or relictual habitat farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks examples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals changes to natural fire regimes forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion impact of introduced species mice cats rabbits dandelions and poison ivy are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates the reasons for this have not always been clear and charles darwin felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved the reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully occasionally however some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they have become part chains of extinction this final group is one of secondary effects all wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them large herbivorous animals such as the hippopotamus have populations of insectivorous birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo should the hippo die out so too will these groups of birds leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected also referred to as a domino effect this series of chain reactions is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any ecological community another example is the black drongos and the cattle egrets found in india these birds feed on insects on the back of cattle which helps to keep them disease-free destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases media wildlife has long been a common subject for educational television shows national geographic specials appeared on cbs beginning in 1965 later moving to abc and then pbs in 1963 nbc debuted wild kingdom a popular program featuring zoologist marlin perkins as host the bbc natural history unit in the uk was a similar pioneer the first wildlife series look presented by sir peter scott was a studio-based show with filmed inserts it was in this series that david attenborough first made his appearance which led to the series zoo quest during which he and cameraman charles lagus went to many exotic places looking for and filming elusive wildlife—notably the komodo dragon in indonesia and lemurs in madagascar since 1984 the discovery channel and its spin off animal planet in the us have dominated the market for shows about wildlife on cable television while on pbs the nature strand made by wnet-13 in new york and nova by wgbh in boston are notable see also nature documentary wildlife television is now a multimillion-dollar industry with specialist documentary film-makers in many countries including uk us new zealand nhnz australia austria germany japan and canada there are many magazines which cover wildlife including national
