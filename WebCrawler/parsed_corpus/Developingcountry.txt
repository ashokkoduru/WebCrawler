or underdeveloped country is a nation or sovereign state with a less developed industrial base and a low human development index hdi relative to other countries however since the late 1990s developing countries tended to demonstrate higher growth rates than the developed ones there are no universally agreed-upon criteria for what makes a country developing versus developed and which countries fit these two categories although there are general reference points such as a nations gdp per capita compared to other nations also the general term less-developed country should not be confused with the specific least developed country there is criticism of the use of the term developing country the term implies inferiority of a developing country or undeveloped country compared to a developed country which many countries dislike it assumes a desire to develop along the traditional western model of economic development which a few countries such as cuba and bhutan choose not to follow an alternative measurement that has been suggested is that of gross national happiness countries on the boundary between developed and developing are often categorized under the term newly industrialized countries according to authors such as walt whitman rostow developing countries are in transition from traditional lifestyles towards the modern lifestyle which began in the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries in the 2016 edition of its world development indicators the world bank made a decision to no longer distinguish between “developed” and “developing” countries in the presentation of its data nobody has ever agreed on a definition for these terms in the first place definition various terms are used for whatever is not a developed country terms used include less developed country or less economically developed country and for the more extreme least developed country or least economically developed country criteria for what is not a developed country can be obtained by inverting the factors that define a developed country people have lower life expectancy people have less education and literacy rate people have less money income women have higher fertility rate and pregnancy kofi annan former secretary general of the united nations defined a developed country as one that allows all its citizens to enjoy a free and healthy life in a safe environment but according to the united nations statistics division the un also notes on the other hand according to the classification from international monetary fund imf before april 2004 all countries of central and eastern europe including central european countries that still belongs to the eastern europe group in the un institutions as well as the former soviet union ussr countries in central asia kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan and mongolia were not included under either developed or developing regions but rather were referred to as countries in transition however they are now widely regarded in the international reports as developing countries the imf uses a flexible classification system that considers 1 per capita income level 2 export diversification—so oil exporters that have high per capita gdp would not make the advanced classification because around 70 of its exports are oil and 3 degree of integration into the global financial system the world bank classifies countries into four income groups these are set each year on july 1 economies were divided according to 2016 gni per capita using the following ranges of income low income countries had gni per capita of us1,025 or less lower middle income countries had gni per capita between us1,026 and us4,035 upper middle income countries had gni per capita between us4,036 and us12,475 high income countries had gni per capita above us12,476 since 2016 the world bank no longer divide countries into two groups according to the out-dated concept of developed and developing along with the current level of development countries may be classified by how much this has changed over some amount of time this may be by absolute numbers or country ranking countries that were more less-developed and are less less-developed also developing country countries that were less-developed and are about the same developing country countries that were less less-developed and are more less-developed developing country measure and concept of development the development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income per capita per person gross domestic product life expectancy the rate of literacy the un has developed the human development index hdi a compound indicator of the above statistics to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available the un sets millennium development goals mdgs from a blueprint developed by all of the worlds countries and leading development institutions in order to evaluate growth developing countries are in general countries that have not achieved a significant degree of industrialization relative to their populations and have in most cases a medium to low standard of living there is a strong association between low income and high population growth the terms utilized when discussing developing countries refer to the intent and to the constructs of those who utilize these terms other terms sometimes used are less developed countries ldcs least economically developed countries ledcs underdeveloped nations or third world nations and non-industrialized nations conversely developed countries most economically developed countries medcs first world nations and industrialized nations are the opposite end of the spectrum to moderate the euphemistic aspect of the word developing international organizations have started to use the term less economically developed country ledcs for the poorest nations—which can in no sense be regarded as developing that is ledcs are the poorest subset of ldcs this may moderate against a belief that the standard of living across the entire developing world is the same the concept of the developing nation is found under one term or another in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations — for example theories of decolonization liberation theology marxism anti-imperialism and political economy another important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country on an average countries with a 50 contribution from the secondary sector of manufacturing have grown substantially similarly countries with a tertiary sector stronghold also see greater rate of economic development some researchers in development economics such as theodore schultz who won a nobel prize in 1979 have found that literate farmers in developing countries are more productive than illiterate farmers they therefore recommend investing in human capital education health etc as an effective tool for economic development others such as mohammed tamim believe that economic development is measurable in educational level from primary school to the university they noticed that wherever the educational level is raised the level of development is also raised they conclude that the percentage of the schooled population is proportional to the economic growth rate and inversely proportional in the demographic growth rate the take-off of walt whitman rostow can start in a country if its population is completely schooled it is therefore necessary for the organization of a worldwide education program itself conditioned by another worldwide program of birth control and the establishment of a worldwide organization for the implementation of this development strategy

development classification of any given country differs across sources and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging use of the term market instead of country usually indicates specific focus on the characteristics of the countries capital markets as opposed to the overall economy developed countries and developed markets developing countries include in decreasing order of economic growth or size of the capital market newly industrialized countries emerging markets frontier markets least developed countries developing countries can also be categorized by geography small island developing states landlocked developing countries other classifications include heavily indebted poor countries a definition by a program of the imf and world bank transition economy moving from a centrally planned to market-driven economy criticism of the term developing country there is some criticism of the use of the term developing country the term implies inferiority of a developing country or undeveloped country compared to a developed country which many countries dislike it is criticized for being too positive and too negative it assumes a desire to develop along the traditional western model of economic development which a few countries such as cuba and bhutan choose not to follow the concept of development rests on the assumption that modernization theory holds modernization theory as the dominant development theory of the late 19th and 20th centuries has largely contributed to the definition of development in short it argues that there is only one way to achieve modernity and development  that of western nation-states largely challenged today modernization theory still holds an important role in defining development the term developing implies mobility and does not acknowledge that development may be in decline or static in some countries particularly in southern african states worst affected by hivaids in such cases the term developing country may be considered a euphemism the term implies homogeneity between such countries which vary widely the term also implies homogeneity within such countries when wealth and health of the most and least affluent groups varies widely similarly the term developed country incorrectly implies a lack of continuing economic developmentgrowth in more-developed countries in general development entails a modern infrastructure both physical and institutional and a move away from low value added sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction developed countries in comparison usually have economic systems based on continuous self-sustaining economic growth in the tertiary sector of the economy and quaternary sector of the economy and high material standards of living however there are notable exceptions as some countries considered developed have a significant component of primary industries in their national economies e.g norway canada australia the usa and western europe have a very important agricultural sector and are major players in international agricultural markets also natural resource extraction can be a very profitable industry high value added e.g oil extraction an alternative measurement that has been suggested is that of gross national happiness measuring the actual satisfaction of people as opposed to how fiscally wealthy a country is during the late 20th century and with the advance of world-systems theory the notions of developed country and developing country have started to slowly be replaced by the less-controversial trade-based notions of core country semi-periphery country and periphery country the terms of developing countries and developed countries although obsolete still continue to be dominant as part of
