way of life redirects here for other uses see way of life disambiguation the term lifestyle can denote the interests opinions behaviours and behavioural orientations of an individual group or culture the term was originally used by austrian psychologist alfred adler 1870-1937 the term was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of style in modernist art the term refers to a combination of determining intangible or tangible factors tangible factors relate specifically to demographic variables i.e an individuals demographic profile whereas intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such as personal values preferences and outlooks a rural environment has different lifestyles compared to an urban metropolis location is important even within an urban scope the nature of the neighborhood in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person due to differences between various neighborhoods degrees of affluence and proximity to natural and cultural environments for example in areas within a close proximity to the sea a surf culture or lifestyle is often present individual identity a lifestyle typically reflects an individuals attitudes way of life values or world view therefore a lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of self and to create cultural symbols that resonate with personal identity not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary surrounding social and technical systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the symbols shehe is able to project to others and the self the lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular lifestyle become blurred in modern society for example green lifestyle means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources and produce less harmful waste i.e a smaller ecological footprint and deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these activities some commentators argue that in modernity the cornerstone of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior which offers the possibility to create and further individualize the self with different products or services that signal different ways of life lifestyle may include views on politics religion health intimacy and more all of these aspects play a role in shaping someones lifestyle in the magazine and television industries lifestyle is used to describe a category of publications or programs history of lifestyles studies three main phases can be identified in the history of lifestyles studies 1 lifestyles and social position  earlier studies on lifestyles focus on the analysis of social structure and of the individuals’ relative positions inside it thorstein veblen with his ‘emulation’ concept opens this perspective by asserting that people adopt specific ‘schemes of life’ and in particular specific patterns of ‘conspicuous consumption’ depending on a desire for distinction from social strata they identify as inferior and a desire for emulation of the ones identified as superior max weber intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation even within the same social class and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire georg simmel carries out formal analysis of lifestyles at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation identification differentiation and recognition understood both as generating processes of and effects generated by lifestyles operating “vertically” as well as “horizontally” finally pierre bourdieu renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus 2 lifestyles as styles of thought  the approach interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought has its roots in the soil of psychological analysis initially starting with alfred adler a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives later particularly in milton rokeach’s work arnold mitchell’s vals research and lynn kahle’s lov research lifestyles’ analysis developed as profiles of values reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically to which different population sectors correspond then with daniel yankelovich and william wells we move on to the so-called aio approach in which attitudes interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles’ components being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context as for instance in bernard cathelat’s work finally a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action 3 lifestyles as styles of action  analysis of lifestyles as action profiles is characterized by the fact that it no longer considers the action level as a simple derivative of lifestyles or at least as their collateral component but rather as a constitutive element in the beginning this perspective focussed mainly on consumer behaviour seeing products acquired as objects expressing on the material plane individuals’ self-image and how they view their position in society subsequently the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life concentrating – as in authors such as joffre dumazedier and anthony giddens – on the use of time especially loisirs and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action finally some authors for instance richard jenkins and a j veal suggested an approach to lifestyles in which it is not everyday actions which make up the plane of analysis but those which the actors who adopt them consider particularly meaningful and distinctive health a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle will most likely be transmitted across generations according to the study done by case et al 2002 when a 0-3 year old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle this child will be 27 more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle for instance high income parents are more likely to eat organic food have time to exercise and provide the best living condition to their children on the other hand low income parents are more likely to participate in unhealthy activities such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression parents are the first teacher for every child everything that parents do will be very likely transferred to their children through the learning process adults may be drawn together by mutual interest that results in a lifestyle for example william dufty described how pursuing a sugar-free diet led to such associations class lifestyle research can contribute to the question of the relevance of the class concept media culture the term lifestyle was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of style in art theodor w adorno noted that there is a culture industry in which the mass media is involved but that the term mass culture is inappropriate the media culture of advanced capitalism typically creates new life-styles to drive the consumption of new commodities diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain by the late 1950s the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion new needs for new commodities had to be created and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated the cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang but this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life on the contrary through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and different commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative life-styles see also george vrousgos n.d  southern cross university alternative lifestyle life stance lifestyle
