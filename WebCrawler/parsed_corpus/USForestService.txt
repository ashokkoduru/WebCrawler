gifford pinchot fighting fires see also history of wildfire suppression in the united states in august 1944 to reduce the number of forest fires the forest service and the wartime advertising council began distributing fire education posters featuring a black bear the poster campaign was a success the black bear would later be named smokey bear and would for decades be the spokesbear for the forest service smokey bear has appeared in innumerable tv commercials his popular catch phrase only you can prevent forest fires is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the united states a recent study found that 95 of the people surveyed could complete the phrase when given the first few words in september 2000 the departments of agriculture and the interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000 to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future the report is entitled managing the impacts of wildfire on communities and the environment a report to the president in response to the wildfires of 2000—the national fire plan for short the national fire plan continues to be an integral part of the forest service today the following are important operational features of the national fire plan federal wildland fire management policy the 1995 federal wildland fire management policy and the subsequent 2001 federal wildland fire management policy act as the foundation of the national fire plan basic premise of the national fire plan investing now in an optimal firefighting force hazardous fuels reduction and overall community protection will provide for immediate protection and future cost savings funding initially 2001 the national fire plan provided for an additional 1,100,994,000 for the forest service for a total wildland fire management budget of 1,910,193,000 in 2008 the total amount for the forest service in wildland fire management not including emergency fire suppression funding is 1,974,276,000 in august 2014 tom vilsack the secretary of agriculture announced that the agency will have to put 400 to 500 million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting is running low as the fiscal year ends the decision is meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in california oregon washington and idaho politicians of both parties have indicated that they believe the current funding structure is broken but they have not agreed on steps to fix the funding allocation budget although part of the department of agriculture the forest service receives its budget through the subcommittee on appropriations—interior environment and related agencies popular culture the u.s forest service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s as it became the setting for the long running classic tv show lassie with storylines focusing on lassies adventures with various forest rangers the iconic collies association with the forest service led to lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the u.s senate and the department of agriculture and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by president lyndon johnson which was dubbed by some as the lassie program controversies the history of the forest service has been fraught with controversy as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests these values and resources include grazing timber mining recreation wildlife habitat and wilderness because of continuing development elsewhere the large size of national forests have made them de facto wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species in recent decades the importance of mature forest for the spotted owl and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels in the 1990s the agency was involved in scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as airtankers see u.s forest service airtanker scandal another controversial issue is the policy on road building within the national forests in 1999 president clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the national forests to assess their ecological economic and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management five and half years later the bush administration replaced this with a system where each state could petition the forest service to open forests in their territory to road building some years the agency actually loses money on its timber sales see also united states portal forests of the united states national forest foundation list of legislation
