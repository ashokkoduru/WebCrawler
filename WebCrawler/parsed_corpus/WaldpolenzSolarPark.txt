the waldpolenz solar park is a 52-megawatt mw photovoltaic power station built by german developer and operator juwi at a former military air base near leipzig eastern germany when completed by the end of 2008 it was the worlds largest thin-film solar park using cdte-modules initially the solar power plants nameplate capacity was 40 mw consisting of 500,000 state-of-the-art solar panels provided by u.s manufacturer first solar and generated 40,000 mwh of electricity per year the solar park was then extended with another 153,650 panels also provided by first solar to a final capacity of 52 mwp in 2011 the installation is located in the muldentalkreis district in the state of saxony in eastern germany built on half of the location’s 220 hectares 543.6 acres in the townships of brandis and bennewitz the investment costs for the waldpolenz solar park have amounted to some 130 million euro see also energy portal energy policy of the european union list of photovoltaic power stations photovoltaics pocking solar park in germany renewable energy commercialization renewable energy in the european union solar power world’s largest solar power plant being built in eastern germany building approval granted for 40 mw photovoltaic project juwi solar presents new large-scale projects and innovations juwi press release 31 aug 2011 retrieved aug 2012.  check date values in access-date help map of site footprint of waldpolenz energy park wiki-solar retrieved 5 march 2015.  exenewable project profile page  waldpolenz pv germany
