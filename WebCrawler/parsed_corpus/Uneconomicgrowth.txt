economics the economics of social welfare and some forms of ecological economics is economic growth that reflects or creates a decline in the quality of life the concept is attributed to leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly though other theorists can also be credited for the incipient idea note uneconomic growth or uneconomic degrowth should not be confused with economic degrowth the reduction of the size of the economy to increase well-being and sustainability the cost or decline in well-being associated with extended economic growth is argued to arise as a result of the social and environmental sacrifices made necessary by that growing encroachment on the eco-system in other words uneconomic growth occurs when increases in production come at an expense in resources and well-being that is worth more than the items made types of growth the rate or type of economic growth may have important consequences for the environment the climate and natural capital of ecologies concerns about possible negative effects of growth on the environment and society led some to advocate lower levels of growth from which comes the idea of uneconomic growth and green parties which argue that economies are part of a global society and a global ecology and cannot outstrip their natural growth without damaging them canadian scientist david suzuki argued in the 1990s that ecologies can only sustain typically about 1.5–3 new growth per year and thus any requirement for greater returns from agriculture or forestry will necessarily cannibalize the natural capital of soil or forest some think this argument can be applied even to more developed economies the role of technology and jevons paradox mainstream economists would argue that economies are driven by new technology—for instance we have faster computers today than a year ago but not necessarily physically more computers growth that relies entirely on exploiting increased knowledge rather than exploiting increased resource consumption may thus not qualify as uneconomic growth in some cases this may be true where technology enables lower amounts of input to be used in producing the same unit of product andor it reduces the amount or hazardousness of the waste generated per unit product produced e.g the increased availability of movies through the internet or cable television electronically may reduce the demand for physical video tapes or dvds for films nonetheless it is crucial to also recognise that innovation or knowledge-driven growth still may not entirely resolve the problem of scale or increasing resource consumption for instance there might likely be more computers due to greater demand and replacements for slower computers the jevons paradox is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase rather than decrease the rate of consumption of that resource for example given that expenditure on necessities and taxes remain the same i the availability of energy-saving lightbulbs may mean lower electricity usage and fees for a household but this frees up more discretionary disposable income for additional consumption elsewhere an example of the rebound effect and ii technology or globalisation that leads to the availability of cheaper goods for consumers also frees up discretionary income for increased consumptive spending on the other hand new renewable energy and climate change mitigation technology such as artificial photosynthesis has been argued to promote a prolonged era of human stewardship over ecosystems known as the sustainocene in the sustainocene instead of the cargo-cult ideology of perpetual economic growth through corporate pillage of nature globalised artificial photosynthesis will facilitate a steady state economy and further technological revolutions such as domestic nano-factories and e-democratic input to local communal and global governance structures in such a world humans will no longer feel economically threatened but rather proud that their moral growth has allowed them to uphold rights of nature see also related reading
