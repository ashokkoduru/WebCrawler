out-of-town commercial developments and encouraging the reuse of brownfield or previously developed sites for residential building nevertheless the demand for housing continues to rise and in the uk

which are heavily subsidised financed by financial activities such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the estates they may vary in scale and are usually located in the remote or less accessible parts of the territory but urban expansion has put some of them in the heart of the urban area although some units are destined exclusively for rental some of the flats
