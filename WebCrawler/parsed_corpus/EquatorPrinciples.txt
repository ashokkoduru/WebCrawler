epfis commit to implementing the ep in their internal environmental and social policies procedures and standards for financing projects and will not provide project finance or project-related corporate loans to projects where the client will not or is unable to comply with the equator principles while the equator principles are not intended to be applied retroactively epfis apply them to the expansion or upgrade of an existing project where changes in scale or scope may create significant environmental and social risks and impacts or significantly change the nature or degree of an existing impact the equator principles have greatly increased the attention and focus on socialcommunity standards and responsibility including robust standards for indigenous peoples labour standards and consultation with locally affected communities within the project finance market they have also promoted convergence around common environmental and social standards multilateral development banks including the european bank for reconstruction development and export credit agencies through the oecd common approaches are increasingly drawing on the same standards as the equator principles the

mechanism principle 7 independent review principle 8 covenants principle 9 independent monitoring and reporting principle 10 reporting and transparency criticism ngos have generally welcomed the principles but some have expressed concerns over their integrity one of these is that the principles will not make a real difference they argue the case of the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline which in 2004 was financed by eight equator principles banks and the ifc despite an ngo assessment that found 127 alleged breaches the banks and ifc said they were confident that the equator principles were followed and said an independent consultant had confirmed this assessment another expressed concern was that the banks might lobby the ifc to weaken its standards on which the principles are based the banks point out that ifc revised and strengthened its policies in 2006 and that the banks correspondingly strengthened the equator principles in the same year other criticisms include alleged lack of enforcement and accountability free-riders and that the scope of the principles is limited to project finance only several banks have sought to address these concerns by publishing summaries of their equator principles screening including the number of projects they turned down for noncompliance in 2005 some ngos said that one of the adopting banks abn amro before it was split up in 2010 was the most climate-unfriendly bank in the netherlands with estimated annual indirect co2 emissions of almost 250 million tonnes in 2005 from industries to which it provides financial services ngos said this was just over the annual co2-emissions of the netherlands and almost 1 of the total annual worldwide co2 emissions at the time abn amro defended its environmental record and announced steps to reduce its direct emissions but some ngos say it is the indirect emissions through their clients that make global banks such important targets in climate change see also corporate social responsibility
