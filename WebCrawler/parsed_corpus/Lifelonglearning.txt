important considerations under the umbrella of emerging technology and lifelong learning access to informal and formal learning opportunities for individuals with disabilities may be dependent upon low and high tech assistive technology web 2.0 the emergence of web 2.0 technologies has great potential to support lifelong learning endeavors allowing for informal just-in-time day-to-day learning constant change is emerging as the new normal in order to survive and thrive organizations and individuals must be able to adjust and enhance their knowledge and skills to meet evolving needs this means the most important thing someone can learn is how to learn an understanding of web 2.0 tools is critical to keeping up with a changing world and the information explosion workplace learning the professions in particular are recognizing the importance of developing practitioners to be lifelong learners nowadays formal training is only a beginning knowledge is accumulating at such a fast rate that one must continue to learn to be effective williams 2001 indeed most professions mandate that their members continue learning in order to maintain their license to practice merriam caffarella baumgartner 2007 having said this what are the characteristics or skills that a lifelong learner will need to develop reflective learning and critical thinking can help a learner to become more self-reliant through learning how to learn thus making them better able to direct manage and control their own learning process candy 1990 sipe 1995 studied experimentally open teachers and found that they valued self-directed learning collaboration reflection and challenge risk taking in their learning was seen as an opportunity not a threat dunlap and grabinger 2003 make the case that in order to prepare students in higher education to be lifelong learners we must develop their capacity for self-direction metacognition awareness and a disposition toward learning merriam caffarella baumgartner 2007 metacognition while the study of metacognition originally gave educational psychologists insights into what differentiated successful students from their less successful peers it is increasingly being used to inform teaching that aims to make students more aware of their learning processes and show them how to regulate those processes for more effective learning throughout their lives educators can employ cognitive strategy instruction csi as a means to help learners develop their metacognition again learners who are better equipped to create learning strategies for themselves will have more success in achieving their cognitive goals as lifelong learning is lifelong lifewide voluntary and self-motivated learning to learn that is learning how to recognize learning strategies and monitor and evaluate learning is a pre-condition for lifelong learning metacognition is an essential first step in developing lifelong learning in practice in india and elsewhere the university of the third age u3a provides an example of the almost spontaneous emergence of autonomous learning groups accessing the expertise of their own members in the pursuit of knowledge and shared experience no prior qualifications and no subsequent certificates feature in this approach to learning for its own sake and as participants testify engagement in this type of learning in later life can indeed prolong active life in sweden the successful concept of study circles an idea launched almost a century ago still represents a large portion of the adult education provision the concept has since spread and for instance is a common practice in finland as well a study circle is one of the most democratic forms of a learning environment that has been created there are no teachers and the group decides on what content will be covered scope will be used as well as a delivery method sometimes lifelong learning aims to provide educational opportunities outside standard educational systems – which can be cost-prohibitive if it is available at all on the other hand formal administrative units devoted to this discipline exist in a number of universities for example the academy of lifelong learning is an administrative unit within the university-wide professional and continuing studies unit at the university of delaware another example is the jagiellonian university extension wszechnica
