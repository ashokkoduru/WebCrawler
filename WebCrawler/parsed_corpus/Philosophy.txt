as is there a best way to live is it better to be just or unjust if one can get away with it do humans have free will historically philosophy encompassed any body of knowledge from the time of ancient greek philosopher aristotle to the 19th century natural philosophy encompassed astronomy medicine and physics for example newtons 1687 mathematical principles of natural philosophy later became classified as a book of physics in the 19th century the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize in the modern era some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines including psychology sociology linguistics and economics other investigations closely related to art science politics or other pursuits remained part of philosophy for example is beauty objective or subjective are there many scientific methods or just one is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being epistemology about the nature and grounds of knowledge and...its limits and validity  ethics aesthetics political philosophy logic philosophy of science and the history of western philosophy since the 20th century professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors researchers and writers however many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law journalism politics religion science business and various art and entertainment activities introduction knowledge traditionally the term philosophy referred to any body of knowledge in this sense philosophy is closely related to religion mathematics natural science education and politics newtons 1687 mathematical principles of natural philosophy is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics he used the term natural philosophy

philosophy physics was the study of the physical world physis lit nature moral philosophy ethics was the study of goodness right and wrong beauty justice and virtue ethos lit custom metaphysical philosophy logos was the study of existence causation god logic forms and other abstract objects meta-physika lit what comes after physics this division is not obsolete but has changed natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences especially astronomy physics chemistry biology and cosmology moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences but still includes value theory including aesthetics ethics political philosophy etc metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic mathematics and philosophy of science but still includes epistemology cosmology and others philosophical progress many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today colin mcginn and others claim that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval chalmers and others by contrast see progress in philosophy similar to that in science while talbot brewer argued that progress is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity historical overview in one general sense philosophy is associated with wisdom intellectual culture and a search for knowledge in that sense all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as how are we to live and what is the nature of reality a broad and impartial conception of philosophy then finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality morality and life in all world civilizations western philosophy main article western philosophy western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the western world and dates to pre-socratic thinkers who were active in ancient greece in the 6th century bc such as thales c 624 – c 546 bc and pythagoras c 570 – c 495 bc who practiced a love of wisdom philosophia and were also termed physiologoi students of physis or nature socrates was a very influential philosopher who insisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom western philosophy can be divided into three eras ancient greco-roman medieval philosophy christian european and modern philosophy the ancient era was dominated by greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of socrates such as plato who founded the platonic academy and was one of the most influential greek thinkers for the whole of western thought platos student aristotle was also extremely influential founding the peripatetic school other traditions include cynicism stoicism greek skepticism and epicureanism important topics covered by the greeks included metaphysics with competing theories such as atomism and monism cosmology the nature of the well-lived life eudaimonia the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason logos with the rise of the roman empire greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in latin by romans such as cicero and seneca medieval philosophy 5th – 16th century is the period following the fall of the roman empire and was dominated by the rise of christianity and hence reflects judeo-christian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with greco-roman thought problems such as the existence and nature of god the nature of faith and reason metaphysics the problem of evil were discussed in this period some key medieval thinkers include st augustine thomas aquinas boethius anselm and roger bacon philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to theology ancilla theologiae and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture this period saw the development of scholasticism a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts the renaissance 1355–1650 period saw increasing focus on classic greco-roman thought and on a robust humanism early modern philosophy in the western world begins with thinkers such as thomas hobbes and rené descartes 1596–1650 following the rise of natural science modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion scholastic thought and the church major modern philosophers include spinoza leibniz locke berkeley hume and kant 19th-century philosophy is influenced by the wider movement termed the enlightenment and includes figures such as hegel a key figure in german idealism nietzsche a famed anti-christian j.s mill who promoted utilitarianism karl marx who developed the foundations for communism and the american william james the 20th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology existentialism logical positivism pragmatism and the linguistic turn middle eastern philosophy see also islamic philosophy and iranian philosophy the regions of the fertile crescent iran and arabia are home to the earliest known philosophical wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by islamic culture early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs in ancient egypt these texts were known as sebayt teachings and they are central to our understandings of ancient egyptian philosophy babylonian astronomy also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the ancient greeks jewish philosophy and christian philosophy are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the middle east and in europe they both share certain early judaic texts mainly the tanakh and monotheistic beliefs jewish thinkers such as the geonim of the talmudic academies in babylonia and maimonides engaged with greek and islamic philosophy later jewish philosophy came under strong western intellectual influences and includes the works of moses mendelssohn who ushered in the haskalah the jewish enlightenment jewish existentialism and reform judaism pre-islamic iranian philosophy begins with the work of zoroaster one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evil this dualistic cosmogony influenced later iranian developments such as manichaeism mazdakism and zurvanism after the muslim conquests early islamic philosophy developed the greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions this islamic golden age influenced european intellectual developments the two main currents of early islamic thought are kalam which focuses on islamic theology and falsafa which was based on aristotelianism and neoplatonism the work of aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as al-kindi 9th century avicenna 980 – june 1037 and averroes 12th century others such as al-ghazali were highly critical of the methods of the aristotelian falsafa islamic thinkers also developed a scientific method experimental medicine a theory of optics and a legal philosophy ibn khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history in iran several schools of islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the golden age and includes currents such as the illuminationist philosophy of mulla sadra sufi

political philosophy as seen in the arthashastra c 4th century bce and the philosophy of love as seen in the kama sutra the commonly named six orthodox schools arose sometime between the start of the common era and the gupta empire these hindu schools developed what has been called the hindu synthesis merging orthodox brahmanical and unorthodox elements from buddhism and jainism as a way to respond to the unorthodox challenges hindu thought also spread east to the indonesian srivijaya empire and the cambodian khmer empire later developments include the development of tantra and

or philosophy that uses distinct african philosophical methods modern african thought has been occupied with ethnophilosophy with defining the very meaning of african philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be african during the 17th century ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by zera yacob another early african philosopher was anton wilhelm amo c 1703 – c 1759 who became a respected philosopher in germany distinct african philosophical ideas include ujamaa the bantu idea of force négritude pan-africanism and ubuntu contemporary african thought has also seen the development of professional philosophy and of africana philosophy the philosophical literature of the african diaspora which includes currents such as

indigenous american philosophy indigenous american philosophy is the philosophy of the indigenous people of the americas there is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different american cultures among some of the native americans in the united states there is a belief is a metaphysical principle called the great mystery siouan wakan tanka algonquian gitche manitou another widely shared concept was that of orenda or spiritual power according to peter m whiteley for the native americans mind is critically informed by transcendental experience dreams visions and so on as well as by reason the practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed shamanism another feature of the indigenous american worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants in mesoamerica aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called tlamatini those who know something and its ideas are preserved in various aztec codices the aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called ometeotl which can be translated as dual cosmic energy and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing slippery world the theory of teotl can be seen as a form of pantheism aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics epistemology values and aesthetics aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli knowledge wisdom which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the nahua proverb the middle good is necessary the inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the amawtakuna who were important in the inca education system as teachers of religion tradition history and ethics categories philosopher questions can be grouped into categories these groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions the groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories various sources present different categorical schemes the categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity these five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study metaphysics and epistemology value theory science logic and mathematics history of western philosophy philosophical traditions these divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive a philosopher might specialize in kantian epistemology or platonic aesthetics or modern political philosophy furthermore these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science religion or mathematics metaphysics main article metaphysics metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality such as existence time objects and their properties wholes and their parts events processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body metaphysics includes cosmology the study of the world in its entirety and ontology the study of being a major point of debate revolves between realism which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and idealism which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial metaphysics deals with the topic of identity essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has without which the object can still retain its identity particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time as opposed to abstract objects such as numbers and universals which are properties held by multiple particulars such as redness or a gender the type of existence if any of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate epistemology main article epistemology epistemology is the study of knowledge greek episteme epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge including intuition a priori reason memory perceptual knowledge self-knowledge and testimony they also ask what is truth is knowledge justified true belief are any beliefs justified putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge knowledge that something is the case know-how knowledge of how to do something and acquaintance familiarity with someone or something epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible skepticism is the position which doubts claims to knowledge the regress argument a fundamental problem in epistemology occurs when in order to completely prove any statement its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification this chain can go on forever called infinitism it can eventually rely on basic beliefs that are left unproven called foundationalism or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification called coherentism rationalism is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge it is associated with a priori knowledge which is independent of experience such as math and logical deduction empiricism is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology broadly construed are philosophy of language explores the nature the origins and the use of language philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body it is typified by disputes between dualism and materialism in recent years this branch has become related to cognitive science philosophy of religion explores questions that arise in connection with religions including the soul the afterlife god religious experience analysis of religious vocabulary and texts and the relationship of religion and science philosophy of human nature analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings such as rationality politics and culture metaphilosophy explores the aims of philosophy its boundaries and its methods value theory value theory or axiology is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness beauty and justice value theory includes ethics aesthetics political philosophy feminist philosophy philosophy of law and more ethics ethics or moral philosophy studies and considers what is good and bad conduct right and wrong values and good and evil its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality it also includes meta-investigations about whether a best way to live or related standards exists the main branches of ethics are normative ethics meta-ethics and applied ethics a major point of debate revolves around consequentialism where actions are judged by the potential results of the act such as to maximize happiness called utilitarianism and deontology where actions are judged by how they adhere to principles irrespective of negative ends aesthetics main article aesthetics aesthetics is the critical reflection on art culture and nature it addresses the nature of art beauty and taste enjoyment emotional values perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty it is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste it divides into art theory literary theory film theory and music theory an example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the cubist aesthetic the philosophy of film analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film images cinema etc as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression political philosophy main article political philosophy political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals or families and clans to communities including the state it includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects as both discuss the question of what how people should live together other branches of value theory there are a variety of branches of value theory philosophy of law often called jurisprudence explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws philosophy of education analyzes the definition and content of education as well as the goals and challenges of educators feminist philosophy explores questions surrounding gender sexuality and the body including the nature of feminism itself as a social and philosophical movement philosophy of sport analyzes sports games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities logic science and mathematics many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry the relationship between x and the philosophy of x is debated richard feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study saying that philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds curtis white by contrast argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities sciences and social sciences the topics of philosophy of science are numbers symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the social sciences and natural sciences logic main article logic logic is the study of reasoning and argument an argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition the connected series of statements are premises and the proposition is the conclusion for example all humans are mortal premise socrates is a human premise therefore socrates is mortal conclusion deductive reasoning is when given certain premises conclusions are unavoidably implied rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as modus ponens where given “a” and “if a then b” then “b” must be concluded because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences social sciences and humanities disciplines logic became a formal science sub-fields include mathematical logic philosophical logic modal logic computational logic and non-classical logics a major issue in the philosophy of mathematics revolves around whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered called mathematical realism or invented called mathematical antirealism philosophy of science main article philosophy of science this branch explores the foundations methods history implications and purpose of science many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science for example philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences the philosophy of mathematics studies the philosophical assumptions foundations and implications of mathematics history of philosophy see also history of ethics further information philosophical progress and list of years in philosophy some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods the history of philosophy study of a specific period individual or school is related to but not the same as the philosophy of history the theoretical aspect of history which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity hegels lectures on the philosophy of history influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history a view called historicism philosophical schools some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools such as continental philosophy analytical philosophy thomism asian philosophy or african philosophy other approaches a variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored applied philosophy the ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs weaver argued that ideas have consequences philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics—applied ethics in particular—and political philosophy the political and economic philosophies of confucius sun tzu chanakya ibn khaldun ibn rushd ibn taymiyyah machiavelli leibniz hobbes locke rousseau adam smith john stuart mill marx tolstoy gandhi and martin luther king jr have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions progressive education as championed by dewey had a profound impact on 20th century us educational practices descendants of this movement include efforts in philosophy for children which are part of philosophy education clausewitzs political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft international politics and military strategy in the 20th century especially around world war ii logic is important in mathematics linguistics psychology computer science and computer engineering other important applications can be found in epistemology which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge sound evidence and justified belief important in law economics decision theory and a number of other disciplines the philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole for example the strictly empirical approach of b f skinners behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the american psychological establishment deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music literature the plastic arts and the whole artistic dimension of life in general the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields society some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers typically by working as professors who teach research and write in academic institutions however most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law journalism religion sciences politics business or various arts for example public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians steve martin and ricky gervais filmmaker terrence malick pope john paul ii wikipedia co-founder larry sanger supreme court justice stephen bryer and vice presidential candidate carly fiorina professional philosophy germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy at the end of 1817 hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed professor by the state namely by the prussian minister of education as an effect of napoleonic reform in prussia in the united states the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the american higher-education system largely based on the german model within the last century philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities like other academic disciplines accordingly it has become less general and more specialized in the view of one prominent recent historian philosophy has become a highly organized discipline done by specialists primarily for other specialists the number of philosophers has exploded the volume of publication has swelled and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline the end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical peer-reviewed journals while it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious political or philosophical views that they consider their philosophy these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today furthermore unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books magazines and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare philosopher michael sandels book justice whats the right thing to do and harry frankfurts on bullshit are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers both works became new york times best sellers non-professional philosophy many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense novelists playwrights filmmakers and musicians as well as scientists social scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity ayn rand is the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of philosophy for all her ayn rands popularity however only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously as a result most of the serious philosophical work on rand has appeared in non-academic non-peer-reviewed journals or in books and the bibliography reflects this fact.15 also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as gerd b achenbach die reine und die praktische philosophie drei vorträge zur philosophischen praxis 1983 and michel weber see his Épreuve de la philosophie 2008 who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework pierre hadot is famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during greco-roman antiquity hadot identified and analyzed the spiritual exercises used in ancient philosophy influencing michel foucaults interest in such practices in the second and third volumes of his history of sexuality by spiritual exercises hadot means practices  intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them.6 the philosophy teachers discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple as auditor reader or interlocutor could make spiritual progress and transform himself within.7 hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in socrates what characterizes socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings hadots recurring theme is that philosophy in antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception and therefore the being of those who practice it that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures and that philosophy as it is taught in universities today is for the most part a distortion of its original therapeutic impulse he brings these concerns together in what is ancient philosophy,7 which has been critically reviewed.8 role of women main article women in philosophy although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse women have engaged in philosophy throughout history women philosophers have contributed since ancient times–notably hipparchia of maroneia active ca 325 bc and arete of cyrene active 5th–4th century bc more were accepted during the ancient medieval and modern eras but no women philosophers became part the western canon until the 20th and 21st century when some sources indicate that susanne langer hannah arendt and simone de beauvoir entered the canon in the early 1800s some colleges and universities in the uk and us began admitting women producing more female academics nevertheless u.s department of education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities in 2014 inside higher education described the philosophy disciplines own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment of women students and professors.university of sheffield philosophy professor jennifer saul stated in 2015 that women are leaving philosophy after being harassed assaulted or retaliated against in the early 1990s the canadian philosophical association noted a gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy in june 2013 a us sociology professor stated that out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total susan price argues that the philosophical canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender according to saul philosophy the oldest of the humanities is also the malest and the whitest while other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics popular culture in 2000 the open court publishing company began publishing a series of books on philosophy and popular culture each book consists of essays written by philosophers for general readers the books explore the meanings concepts and puzzles within television shows movies music and other icons of popular culture analyzing topics such as the tv shows seinfeld and the simpsons the matrix and star wars movies and related media and new technological developments such as the ipod and facebook their most recent publication as of 2016 is titled louis c.k and philosophy its subject is the comedian louis c.k the matrix makes numerous references to philosophy including buddhism vedanta advaita hinduism christianity messianism judaism gnosticism existentialism and nihilism the films premise resembles platos allegory of the cave descartess evil demon kants reflections on the phenomenon versus the ding an sich zhuangzis zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly marxist
