environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein and discussing new and emerging issues the un wanted rio to endorse a un green economy roadmap with environmental goals targets and deadlines whereas developing countries preferred establishing new sustainable development goals to better protect the

range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention the british online newspaper the guardian reported that “downtown rio de janeiro was partly shut-down as an estimated 50,000 protesters some of whom were naked took to the streets.” participation a few key global leaders—mostly g20 leaders and namely united states president barack obama german chancellor angela merkel and uk prime minister david cameron—did not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing european sovereign-debt crisis their collective absence
