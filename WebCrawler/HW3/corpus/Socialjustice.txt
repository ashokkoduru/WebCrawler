<p><b>Social justice</b> is the <a class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Fairness_(disambiguation)" title="Fairness (disambiguation)">fair</a> and <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">just</a> relation between the <a href="/wiki/Individual" title="Individual">individual</a> and <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">wealth</a>, opportunities for personal activity and <a href="/wiki/Privilege_(social_inequality)" title="Privilege (social inequality)">social privileges</a>. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Western_Civilization" title="Western Civilization">Western</a> as well as in older <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Asia" title="Culture of Asia">Asian cultures</a>, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their <a href="/wiki/Role_theory" title="Role theory">societal roles</a> and receive what was their due from society. In the current global <a href="/wiki/Grassroots" title="Grassroots">grassroots movements</a> for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for <a href="/wiki/Social_mobility" title="Social mobility">social mobility</a>, the creation of <a href="/wiki/Social_safety_net" title="Social safety net">safety nets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">economic justice</a>.</p>
<p>Social justice assigns rights and duties in the <a href="/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutions</a> of society, which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation. The relevant institutions often include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taxation" title="Taxation">taxation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_insurance" title="Social insurance">social insurance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Public_health" title="Public health">public health</a>, <a href="/wiki/State_school" title="State school">public school</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_services" title="Public services">public services</a>, <a href="/wiki/Labour_law" title="Labour law">labour law</a> and <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">markets</a>, to ensure <a href="/wiki/Fair" title="Fair">fair</a> <a href="/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth" title="Distribution of wealth">distribution of wealth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Equal_opportunity" title="Equal opportunity">equal opportunity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Equality_of_outcome" title="Equality of outcome">equality of outcome</a>.</p>
<p>Interpretations that relate justice to a <a href="/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_and_political_philosophy)" title="Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)">reciprocal relationship</a> to society are mediated by differences in cultural traditions, some of which emphasize the individual responsibility toward society and others the equilibrium between access to power and its responsible use. Hence, social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures such as <a href="/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas" title="Bartolomé de las Casas">Bartolomé de las Casas</a>, in philosophical debates about differences among human beings, in efforts for gender, racial and social equality, for advocating justice for migrants, prisoners, the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environment</a>, and the physically and mentally disabled.</p>
<p>While the concept of social justice can be traced through the theology of <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> and the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, the term "social justice" became used explicitly from the 1840s. A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jesuit" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest named <a href="/wiki/Luigi_Taparelli" title="Luigi Taparelli">Luigi Taparelli</a> is typically credited with coining the term, and it spread during the <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848" title="Revolutions of 1848">revolutions of 1848</a> with the work of <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Rosmini-Serbati" title="Antonio Rosmini-Serbati">Antonio Rosmini-Serbati</a>. In the late industrial revolution, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Progressive_era" title="Progressive era">progressive</a> American legal scholars began to use the term more, particularly <a href="/wiki/Louis_Brandeis" title="Louis Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roscoe_Pound" title="Roscoe Pound">Roscoe Pound</a>. From the early 20th century it was also embedded in <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> and institutions; the preamble to establish the <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" title="International Labour Organization">International Labour Organization</a> recalled that "universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice." In the later 20th century, social justice was made central to the philosophy of the <a href="/wiki/Social_contract" title="Social contract">social contract</a>, primarily by <a href="/wiki/John_Rawls" title="John Rawls">John Rawls</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice" title="A Theory of Justice">A Theory of Justice</a></i> (1971).

<p>The different concepts of <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">justice</a>, as discussed in ancient <a href="/wiki/Western_philosophy" title="Western philosophy">Western philosophy</a>, were typically centered upon the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> wrote in <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Republic_(Plato)" title="The Republic (Plato)">The Republic</a></i> that it would be an ideal state that "every member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted." In an article for J.N.V University, author D.R. Bhandari says, "Justice is, for Plato, at once a part of human virtue and the bond, which joins man together in society. It is the identical quality that makes good and social. Justice is an order and duty of the parts of the soul, it is to the soul as health is to the body. Plato says that justice is not mere strength, but it is a harmonious strength. Justice is not the right of the stronger but the effective harmony of the whole. All moral conceptions revolve about the good of the whole-individual as well as social.".</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> believed rights existed only between free people, and the law should take "account in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality." Reflecting this time when <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and subjugation of women was typical, ancient views of justice tended to reflect the rigid class systems that still prevailed. On the other hand, for the privileged groups, strong concepts of fairness and the community existed. <a href="/wiki/Distributive_justice" title="Distributive justice">Distributive justice</a> was said by <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> to require that people were distributed goods and assets according to their merit.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> (through <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s dialogue <i><a href="/wiki/Crito" title="Crito">Crito</a></i>) is attributed with developing the idea of a <a href="/wiki/Social_contract" title="Social contract">social contract</a>, whereby people ought to follow the rules of a society, and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits. During the Middle Ages, religious scholars particularly, such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> continued discussion of justice in various ways, but ultimately connected being a good citizen to the purpose of serving God.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reformation" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, the modern concept of social justice, as developing human potential, began to emerge through the work of a series of authors. <a href="/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza" title="Baruch Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> in <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/On_the_Improvement_of_the_Understanding" title="On the Improvement of the Understanding">On the Improvement of the Understanding</a></i> (1677) contended that the one true aim of life should be to acquire "a human character much more stable than [one's] own", and to achieve this "pitch of perfection... The chief good is that he should arrive, together with other individuals if possible, at the possession of the aforesaid character." During the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">enlightenment</a> and responding to the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Revolutions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a> similarly wrote in <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Rights_of_Man" title="The Rights of Man">The Rights of Man</a></i> (1792) society should give "genius a fair and universal chance" and so "the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward... all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions."</p>

<p>The first modern usage of the specific term "social justice" is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s, including the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jesuit" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> <a href="/wiki/Luigi_Taparelli" title="Luigi Taparelli">Luigi Taparelli</a> in <i>Civiltà Cattolica</i>, based on the work of St. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>. He argued that rival <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist">socialist</a> theories, based on subjective <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" title="René Descartes">Cartesian</a> thinking, undermined the unity of society present in <a href="/wiki/Thomism" title="Thomism">Thomistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a> as neither were sufficiently concerned with <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">moral</a> <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> stated in <i><a href="/wiki/Utilitarianism" title="Utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a></i> his view that "Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge."</p>
<p>In the later 19th and early 20th century, social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy, particularly in the work of <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">John Dewey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roscoe_Pound" title="Roscoe Pound">Roscoe Pound</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louis_Brandeis" title="Louis Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a>. One of the prime concerns was the <i><a href="/wiki/Lochner_era" title="Lochner era">Lochner era</a></i> decisions of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_Supreme_Court" title="US Supreme Court">US Supreme Court</a> to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement, such as the <a href="/wiki/Eight-hour_day" title="Eight-hour day">eight-hour day</a> or the right to join a <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade union</a>. After the First World War, the founding document of the <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" title="International Labour Organization">International Labour Organization</a> took up the same terminology in its preamble, stating that "peace can be established only if it is based on social justice". From this point, the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse. In the late 20th century, a number of liberal and conservative thinkers, notably <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Friedrich_von_Hayek" title="Friedrich von Hayek">Friedrich von Hayek</a> rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything, or meant too many things. However the concept remained highly influential, particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as <a href="/wiki/John_Rawls" title="John Rawls">John Rawls</a>.</p>

<p>Political philosopher <a href="/wiki/John_Rawls" title="John Rawls">John Rawls</a> draws on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utilitarian" title="Utilitarian">utilitarian</a> insights of <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham" title="Jeremy Bentham">Bentham</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill" title="John Stuart Mill">Mill</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Social_contract" title="Social contract">social contract</a> ideas of <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Categorical_imperative" title="Categorical imperative">categorical imperative</a> ideas of <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>. His first statement of principle was made in <i>A Theory of Justice</i> where he proposed that, "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others." A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deontological" title="Deontological">deontological</a> proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in <a href="/wiki/Moral_absolutism" title="Moral absolutism">absolutist</a> terms. His views are definitively restated in <i><a href="/wiki/Political_Liberalism" title="Political Liberalism">Political Liberalism</a></i> where society is seen "as a fair system of co-operation over time, from one generation to the next".</p>
<p>All societies have a basic structure of social, economic, and political institutions, both formal and informal. In testing how well these elements fit and work together, Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract. To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate, he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it, but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding. Obviously, not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved, so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable. Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes, and, to that extent, X holds these powers as a <a href="/wiki/Trustee" title="Trustee">trustee</a> for the citizen.</li>
<li>X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate. The citizen, therefore, is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to one person who represents a small group (e.g., the organiser of a social event setting a dress code) as equally as it does to national governments, which are ultimate trustees, holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries. Governments that fail to provide for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_welfare" title="Social welfare">welfare</a> of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate. To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments, Rawls asserted that, "There is ... a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason. But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty." This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold — to some extent, the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome. According to Rawls, the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_thought" title="Freedom of thought">Freedom of thought</a>;</li>
<li>Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion, philosophy, and morality;</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_association" title="Freedom of association">Freedom of association</a>;</li>
<li>Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (namely: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and</li>
<li>Rights and liberties covered by the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Thomas_Pogge">Thomas Pogge</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thomas_Pogge" title="Thomas Pogge">Thomas Pogge</a>'s arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits. He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution, that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable. Thomas argues that social institutions have a negative duty, that means that their duty is to not harm the poor.</p>
<p>Pogge speaks of Institutional Cosmopolitanism and assigns responsibility to institutional schemes for deficits of human rights. An example given is slavery and third parties. A third party should not recognize or enforce slavery. The institutional order should be held responsible only for deprivations of human rights that it establishes or authorizes. The current institutional design systematically harms developing economies by enabling corporate tax evasion, illicit financial flows, corruption, trafficking of people and weapons as a few examples. Joshua Cohen disputes his claims based on the fact that some poor countries have done well in spite of the current institutional design. Elizabeth Kahn argues that some of these responsibilities should apply globally.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Nations">United Nations</span></h4>
<p>The United Nations’ 2006 document <i>Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations</i>, states that "Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth..."</p>
<p>The term "social justice" was seen by the U.N. "as a substitute for the protection of human rights [and] first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s. At the initiative of the Soviet Union, and with the support of developing countries, the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development, adopted in 1969."</p>
<p>The same document reports, "From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence, repression and chaos." The report concludes, "Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent <a href="/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth" title="Redistribution of income and wealth">redistributive policies</a> conceived and implemented by public agencies."</p>
<p>The same UN document offers a concise history: "[T]he notion of social justice is relatively new. None of history’s great philosophers—not Plato or Aristotle, or Confucius or Averroes, or even Rousseau or Kant—saw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective. The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine. It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist exploitation of labour and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition. It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity. Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s, social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists.... By the mid-twentieth century, the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world..."</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Islam">Islam</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a> contains numerous references to elements of social justice. For example, one of Islam's Five Pillars is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zak%C4%81t" title="Zakāt">Zakāt</a>, or alms-giving. Charity and assistance to the poor – concepts central to social justice – are and have historically been important parts of the Islamic faith.</p>
<p>In Muslim history, Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice. Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Umayyad#Insurrection" title="Umayyad">Abbasid revolt</a> against the Umayyads. The Shi'a believe that the return of the <i>Mahdi</i> will herald in "the messianic age of justice" and the Mahdi along with the Isa (Jesus) will end plunder, torture, oppression and discrimination.</p>
<p>For the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" title="Muslim Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of <a href="/wiki/Consumerism" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communism</a>. The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work. However, the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need. It held that <i>zakat</i> (alms-giving) was not voluntary charity, but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate. Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the <i>zakat</i> through taxes.</p>
<p>Though monetary donations are the most practiced way of <a href="/wiki/Zakat" title="Zakat">zakat</a>, Islam is deeply rooted in the tenets of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volunteerism" title="Volunteerism">volunteerism</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_activism" title="Social activism">social activism</a>. Areas of one's communities which require assistance and beneficiaries must be a Muslim's foci if need be, rather than strictly her or his personal or superficial wants. For example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecological" title="Ecological">ecological</a> well-being of the planet (i.e.: animal rights, global warming, natural resources degradation); locally, nationally, globally, is a campaign to which every Muslim must adhere. Many Muslims practice this today by ensuring that they produce minimal waste, give to charity what they no longer need, and spend time in prayer and meditation upon the bounties of nature so as to more mindfully approach all that is provided by nature, and ultimately, <a href="/wiki/Allah" title="Allah">Allah</a>. Other areas of society in need may be the safety and security of minority populations, i.e.: women or persons of color, children, the elderly, the developmentally or physically disabled, animals, et al.</p>

<p>Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life. A distinctive feature of Catholic social doctrine is its concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. Two of the seven key areas of "Catholic social teaching" are pertinent to social justice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Life and dignity of the human person: The foundational principle of all "Catholic Social Teaching" is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person, from conception to natural death. Human life must be valued above all material possessions.</li>
<li>Preferential option for the poor and vulnerable: Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Day_of_Judgement" title="Day of Judgement">Day of Judgement</a> God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy: "Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me." The Catholic Church believes that through words, prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with, and compassion for, the poor. The moral test of any society is "how it treats its most vulnerable members. The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation. People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor."</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine, social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII" title="Pope Leo XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>, who studied under Taparelli, published in 1891 the <a href="/wiki/Encyclical" title="Encyclical">encyclical</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Rerum_novarum" title="Rerum novarum">Rerum novarum</a></i> (On the Condition of the Working Classes), rejecting both socialism and capitalism, while defending labor unions and private property. He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not <a href="/wiki/Class_conflict" title="Class conflict">class conflict</a> and <a href="/wiki/Competition" title="Competition">competition</a>. In this document, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony.</li>
<li>The encyclical <i><a href="/wiki/Quadragesimo_anno" title="Quadragesimo anno">Quadragesimo anno</a></i> (On Reconstruction of the Social Order, literally "in the fortieth year") of 1931 by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI" title="Pope Pius XI">Pope Pius XI</a>, encourages a <a href="/wiki/Living_wage" title="Living wage">living wage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Subsidiarity_(Catholicism)" title="Subsidiarity (Catholicism)">subsidiarity</a>, and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order, saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> added much to the corpus of the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_social_teaching" title="Catholic social teaching">Catholic social teaching</a>, penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics, politics, geo-political situations, ownership of the means of production, private property and the "<a href="/wiki/Social_mortgage" title="Social mortgage">social mortgage</a>", and private property. The encyclicals <i><a href="/wiki/Laborem_exercens" title="Laborem exercens">Laborem exercens</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sollicitudo_rei_socialis" title="Sollicitudo rei socialis">Sollicitudo rei socialis</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Centesimus_annus" title="Centesimus annus">Centesimus annus</a></i> are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice. Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, and spoke forcefully for the poor. He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused, and admits a fear that the "progress" of the world is not true progress at all, if it should denigrate the value of the human person. He argued in <i><a href="/wiki/Centesimus_annus" title="Centesimus annus">Centesimus annus</a></i> that private property, markets, and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>'s encyclical <i><a href="/wiki/Deus_caritas_est" title="Deus caritas est">Deus caritas est</a></i> ("God is Love") of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics, and not of the church, which has charity as its central social concern. It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate, using reason and natural law, and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics.</li>
<li>The official Catholic doctrine on <b>social justice</b> can be found in the book <i>Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church</i>, published in 2004 and updated in 2006, by the <a href="/wiki/Pontifical_Council_for_Justice_and_Peace" title="Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace">Pontifical Council <i>Iustitia et Pax</i></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Catechism (§1928–1948) contain more detail of the Church's view of social justice.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice. <a href="/wiki/Moral_relativism" title="Moral relativism">Moral relativists</a> deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non_cognitivism" title="Non cognitivism">Non-cognitivists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moral_skepticism" title="Moral skepticism">moral skeptics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moral_nihilism" title="Moral nihilism">moral nihilists</a>, and most <a href="/wiki/Logical_positivism" title="Logical positivism">logical positivists</a> deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Political_realism" title="Political realism">Political realists</a> believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the <a href="/wiki/Status_quo" title="Status quo">status quo</a>.</p>
<p>Many other people accept some of the basic principles of social justice, such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value, but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this. One example is the statement by <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a> that all people are "equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen."</p>
<p>On the other hand, some scholars reject the very idea of social justice as meaningless, religious, self-contradictory, and ideological, believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible, and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty. Perhaps the most complete rejection of the concept of social justice comes from <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek" title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Austrian_School" title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a> of economics:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed, and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such (as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined) would appear just to us. [Social justice] does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense, like the term 'a moral stone'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben O'Neill of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales" title="University of New South Wales">University of New South Wales</a> argues that, for proponents of "social justice":</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>the notion of "rights" is a mere term of entitlement, indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good, no matter how important or trivial, abstract or tangible, recent or ancient. It is merely an assertion of desire, and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire.</p>
<p>In fact, since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods, paid for through the efforts of others, the term actually refers to an intention to use <i>force</i> to acquire one's desires. Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action, production and voluntary exchange, but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Janusz_Korwin-Mikke" title="Janusz Korwin-Mikke">Janusz Korwin-Mikke</a> states, "Either 'social justice' has the same meaning as 'justice' – or not. If so – why use the additional word 'social?' We lose time, we destroy trees to obtain paper necessary to print this word. If not, if 'social justice' means something different from 'justice' – then 'something different from justice' is by definition 'injustice.'"</p>
<p>Sociologist <a href="/wiki/Carl_L._Bankston" title="Carl L. Bankston">Carl L. Bankston</a> has argued that a secular, leftist view of social justice entails viewing the redistribution of goods and resources as based on the rights of disadvantaged categories of people, rather than on compassion or national interest. Bankston maintains that this secular version of social justice became widely accepted due to the rise of demand-side economics and to the moral influence of the civil rights movement.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_justice_movements">Social justice movements</span></h2>

<p>Social justice is also a concept that is used to describe the movement towards a socially just world, e.g., the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_Justice_Movement" title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a>. In this context, social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality, and can be defined as <i>"the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society"</i>.</p>
<p>A number of <a href="/wiki/Social_movement" title="Social movement">movements</a> are working to achieve social justice in society. These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society, regardless of background or procedural justice, have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Liberation_theology">Liberation theology</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Liberation_theology" title="Liberation theology">Liberation theology</a></div>
<p>Liberation theology is a movement in <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theology</a> which conveys the teachings of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor", and by detractors as Christianity perverted by <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>.</p>
<p>Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region. It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. The term was coined by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peruvian" title="Peruvian">Peruvian</a> priest, <a href="/wiki/Gustavo_Guti%C3%A9rrez" title="Gustavo Gutiérrez">Gustavo Gutiérrez</a>, who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, <i>A Theology of Liberation</i> (1971). According to <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Kleeb&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sarah Kleeb (page does not exist)">Sarah Kleeb</a>, "Marx would surely take issue," she writes, "with the appropriation of his works in a religious context...there is no way to reconcile Marx's views of religion with those of Gutierrez, they are simply incompatible. Despite this, in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world, and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path, the two have much in common; and, particularly in the first edition of [A Theology of Liberation], the use of Marxian theory is quite evident."</p>
<p>Other noted exponents are <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_Boff" title="Leonardo Boff">Leonardo Boff</a> of Brazil, <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Mugica" title="Carlos Mugica">Carlos Mugica</a> of Argentina, <a href="/wiki/Jon_Sobrino" title="Jon Sobrino">Jon Sobrino</a> of El Salvador, and <a href="/wiki/Juan_Luis_Segundo" title="Juan Luis Segundo">Juan Luis Segundo</a> of Uruguay.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_care">Health care</span></h3>
<p>Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of <a href="/wiki/Bioethics" title="Bioethics">bioethics</a>. Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care, especially for low income households and families. The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families, and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare. <a href="/wiki/Ruth_Faden" title="Ruth Faden">Ruth Faden</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Berman_Institute_of_Bioethics" title="Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics">Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics</a> and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most. They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings.</p>
<p>Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations. These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level, gender, education or any other stratifying factors. Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model.</p>
