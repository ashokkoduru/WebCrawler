<p>The <b>United Nations Global Compact</b> is a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and <a href="/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility" title="Corporate social responsibility">socially responsible</a> policies, and to report on their implementation. The UN Global Compact is a principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten principles in the areas of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, <a href="/wiki/Labor_relations" title="Labor relations">labour</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)" title="Environment (biophysical)">environment</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-corruption" title="Anti-corruption">anti-corruption</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Ten_Principles">The Ten Principles</span></h2>
<p>The UN Global Compact was initially launched with nine Principles. On June 24, 2004, during the first Global Compact Leaders Summit, Kofi Annan announced the addition of the tenth principle against <a href="/wiki/Political_corruption" title="Political corruption">corruption</a> in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Corruption" title="United Nations Convention against Corruption">United Nations Convention Against Corruption</a> adopted in 2003.</p>
<p><b>Human Rights</b><br/>

</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Facilitation">Facilitation</span></h2>
<p>The UN Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument, but rather a forum for discussion and a network for communication including governments, companies and labour organisations, whose actions it seeks to influence, and civil society organizations, representing its stakeholders. The UN Global Compact says that once companies declared their support for the principles "[T]his does not mean that the Global Compact recognizes or certifies that these companies have fulfilled the Compact’s principles." Instead, as mentioned in a 2015 interview with Executive Director, Lise Kingo, "we are the guide dogs, not the watchdogs", with the organization seeking to prioritize providing resources and support instead of attempting to enforce discipline.</p>
<p>The UN Global Compact's goals are intentionally flexible and vague, but it distinguishes the following channels through which it provides facilitation and encourages dialogue: policy dialogues, learning, local networks and projects. Given recent climate talks and summits, the UN Global Compact stands to play a critical role in helping signatories and governments work in part to achieve the SDGs. Recent studies indicate that businesses are more open than ever to private sector interventions, such as carbon pricing and other mechanics to help curb climate effects within the scope of business solutions. The Global Compact also will periodically create resources and guides that business and non profit organizations may use in their efforts to support the Compact's overall mission. One such example is the <a class="external text" href="http://sdgcompass.org/" rel="nofollow">SDG Compass</a>, developed in collaboration with the <a href="/wiki/Global_Reporting_Initiative" title="Global Reporting Initiative">Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_Business_Council_for_Sustainable_Development" title="World Business Council for Sustainable Development">World Business Council for Sustainable Development</a> (WBSCD), which is a collection of resources (analysis of the goals, indicators for businesses, tools for stakeholders) that companies can utilize in finding out their role in helping to achieve the SDGs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The first Global Compact Leaders Summit, chaired by the then Secretary-General <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a>, was held in UN Headquarters in New York on June 24, 2004, to bring "intensified international focus and increased momentum" to the UN Global Compact. The second Global Compact Leaders Summit, chaired by Secretary-General <a href="/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a>, was held on 5–6 July 2007 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. It adopted the <a class="external text" href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/NewsandEvents/news_archives/2007_07_06c.html" rel="nofollow">Geneva Declaration</a> on corporate responsibility. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Global Compact's launch, the Global Compact Leaders Summit 2010 took place on 24–25 June 2010 in New York. On the occasion, the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership  identifying leadership criteria linked to implementation of the ten principles, efforts to support development objectives, and engagement in the Global Compact was released. In 2009 <a href="/wiki/Rotary_International" title="Rotary International">Rotary International</a> partnered with the UN Global Compact. This was a very friendly partnership since Rotary International played a role in the chartering of the United Nations. Since its creation in 2000 the Global Compact has been primarily focused on helping support and achieve the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a>, however, after those expired in 2015, their top priority has been updated to the pursuit and progress towards achieving the <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals" title="Sustainable Development Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, and the SDG's accompanying 2030 deadlines.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="UN_Global_Compact_.E2.80.93_Cities_Programme">UN Global Compact – Cities Programme</span></h2>

<p>In 2001, the City of <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> proposed that cities as well as corporations should be allowed to join the UN Global Compact, arguing that this would provide a clear statement of a city's commitment to positive change, as well as motivating participation in international dialogue. The proposal was accepted, and the UN Global Compact - Cities Programme was launched in 2002. It was formed as an urban-focused component of the Global Compact with its International Secretariat initially located in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia. The aim of the programme is to improve urban life in cities throughout the world.</p>
<p>Melbourne became the first city to engage the Global Compact in June 2001. There are, as of 2016, over 130 member cities in the programme.</p>
<p>In April 2003, under the directorship of David Teller, a framework called the Melbourne Model was developed that went beyond the Ten Principles. It begins by drawing the resources of government, business and civil society into a cross-sector partnership in order to develop a practical project that addresses a seemingly intractable urban issue. In 2007, the then Director, <a href="/wiki/Paul_James_(academic)" title="Paul James (academic)">Paul James</a> (2007–2014) and his colleagues Dr. Andy Scerri and Dr. Liam Magee, took this methodology further by integrating the partnership model with a four-domain sustainability framework called '<a href="/wiki/Circles_of_Sustainability" title="Circles of Sustainability">Circles of Sustainability</a>'.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Secretariat moved from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Committee_For_Melbourne" title="Committee For Melbourne">Committee For Melbourne</a> to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_Cities_Institute" title="Global Cities Institute">Global Cities Institute</a> at <a href="/wiki/RMIT_University" title="RMIT University">RMIT University</a>, itself affiliated with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN-HABITAT" title="UN-HABITAT">UN-HABITAT</a>. There, projects associated with city-based responses to global <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> and <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a> became increasingly important. The Melbourne Model was further elaborated, with a sustainability indicators program developed as a way of assessing and monitoring progress. In 2012, the <a href="/wiki/Circles_of_Sustainability" title="Circles of Sustainability">Circles of Sustainability</a> method was elaborated to guide a city or urban region through a rigorous assessment process. As one of the outcomes it provides a figurative image of the overall sustainability of that city to illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In 2015, RMIT Professor Ralph Horne became the third director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme and in February 2016 an Urban Thinkers Campus was organised at RMIT Melbourne in collaboration with World Vision International as part of the buildup to UN Habitat III. The theme of the Urban Thinkers Campus was Ethical Cities: Locking in Liveability. This was followed by the organisation of a Urban Innovation Forum on Ethical Cities in July 2016 in Barcelona, Spain as a collaboration between the UN Global Compact - Cities Programme, RMIT Europe and UN-Habitat.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Local_Networks_of_the_Global_Compact">Local Networks of the Global Compact</span></h2>
<p>Local networks of the Global Compact advance the initiative and its ten principles at a country level. Currently there are approximately 85 Local Networks in total. These networks help companies and non profit organizations understand what responsible business means within diverse national, cultural, and linguistic contexts. Additionally, there are related programs for particular topics of interest, such as the Business for Peace initiative, that bring awareness to businesses and other organizations about instability and conflict, such that organizations can help to address these concerns from their own perspective and with the assistance of their local networks. Local connections to supplement the international connections made by the Global Compact at large can help to broaden the engagement and impact of members. Local Networks are independent, self-governed and self managed entities, and work closely with the UN Global Compact's New York headquarters, and coordinate as points of contact for UN Global Compact signatories in their respective countries. The Local Networks of the Global Compact are showcased, but not limited to the interactions chronicled below:</p>
<p><b>Global Compact in Australia</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Global Compact Local Network in Australia was established in 2009 by a steering committee drawn from the Australian business community and stakeholder groups. It was formally incorporated in 2011. as the Global Compact Network Australia Limited, and elections were held for the inaugural board of directors. In 2011 it established two business-led leadership groups dealing with human rights and anti-corruption. The GCNA draws its funding directly from members and member-based activities, in contrast to many networks who rely in part on government funding.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Global Compact Network in Bulgaria</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Global Compact Local Network in Bulgaria was founded in January 2003, under the auspices of President <a href="/wiki/Georgi_Parvanov" title="Georgi Parvanov">Georgi Parvanov</a>. The voluntary initiative unites 120 Bulgarian companies, non-governmental organizations and academia into a unique network. All members are united around the idea to apply the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in their daily practices and to be responsible corporate citizens.In 2006, to strengthen and enhance the role of the initiative, a management structure was introduced consisting of Advisory Board and a Secretariat. For the period 2006-2010 the network activities were supported by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Program" title="United Nations Development Program">United Nations Development Program</a> Bulgaria. With the active participation and financial contribution of its members Global Compact Bulgaria organized numerous initiatives related to environment, health, education and youth. Among them are the projects: "Unleashing Entrepreneurship"; "Love Bridge"; "Sharing Best Practices in Corporate Social Responsibility".</li>
<li>With the end of the support from UNDP Bulgaria, the Global Compact Local Network in <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> had to identify and formulate a new strategy for sustainability. So, between 2009 and 2010 the members signed an institutional framework for future organizational development. As a result, on 10 September 2010 a new independent organization was founded – Association Global Compact Network Bulgaria. Its members are 20 leading companies and organizations in Bulgaria, members the UN Global Compact as well. The Association is managed by a Steering Committee and Control Committee. Their main goals are to learn from each other, to communicate, to generate an advocacy impact and initiate dialogue or partnerships with other actors such as the government, local authorities, labour organisations and civil society organizations.</li>

</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Some critics believe that without any effective monitoring and enforcement provisions, the Global Compact fails to hold corporations accountable. Moreover, these critics argue that companies could potentially misuse the Global Compact as a public relations instrument for "<a href="/wiki/Bluewash" title="Bluewash">bluewash</a>". Bluewashing refers to the alleged practice of companies claiming their membership or participation in philanthropic and charity based activity as an excuse, and perhaps as an entry door to increase corporate influence upon international organizations. An informal network previously known as <a class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070908054552/http://www.globalcompactcritics.net/" rel="nofollow">Global Compact Critics</a> leveled a variety of criticisms at the Global Compact, citing a lack of mechanisms for sanctioning non compliance or lack of progress. The Global Compact critics formally disbanded in February 2015, recommending that interested parties consult the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) website. Similarly, the <a class="external text" href="http://www.corpwatch.org/section.php?id=101" rel="nofollow">Alliance for a Corporate-Free UN</a>, which also no longer exists, was a campaigning organization of several international NGOs, led by Corpwatch, which highlighted weaknesses in the principles underlying the Global Compact. The Global Compact was criticized by Maude Barlow, senior adviser on water issues to the President of the United Nations General Assembly in December 2008, accused the Global Compact of bluewashing. David Andrews, senior adviser on Food Policy and Sustainable Development, and Peter Utting, deputy director of UNRISD. Leaders of the tribe Ayoreo Indians in <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> wrote to the UN Global Compact saying they are "concerned and frustrated" by the inclusion in it of a controversial Brazilian ranching company. The company, Yaguarete Porá, was charged and fined for illegally clearing the Ayoreo's forests, and concealing evidence of uncontacted Ayoreo living there. The Ayoreo asked that it be expelled from the Global Compact.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Support">Support</span></h2>
<p>The Global Compact provides a list of its 12,000+ participant organizations, composed of roughly 8,000 businesses and 4,000 non-business entities on its <a class="external text" href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants" rel="nofollow">website</a>. The site provides a brief overview of each participant, and a link to their Letter of Commitment (if new), Financial Overview and Contributions (if applicable), and Communication on Progress (COP). Notable companies who have signed on the Global Compact include, but are not limited to, Starbucks, L'Oreal, Bayer AG, Coca-Cola, 3M, and Deloitte. In addition to its signatories, the Global compact has been repeatedly supported by the UN General Assembly, honoring its 15th anniversary in June 2015 alongside the Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, himself who claims that "Business can be a global force for good" and that "advocacy and example can drive action to achieve a life of dignity for all people".</p>
