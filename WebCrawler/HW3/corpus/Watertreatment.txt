<p>Treatment for <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a> production involves the removal of contaminants from raw water to produce water that is <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Purity" title="wiktionary:Purity">pure</a> enough for human consumption without any short term or long term risk of any adverse health effect.

</ul>
<p>Technologies for potable water treatment are well developed, and generalized designs are available that are used by many <a href="/wiki/Water_industry" title="Water industry">water utilities</a> (public or private). In addition, a number of private companies provide patented technological solutions. Automation of water and waste-water treatment is common in the developed world. Capital costs, operating costs, available quality monitoring technologies, and locally available skills typically dictate the level of automation adopted.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Polluted_water_treatment">Polluted water treatment</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Wastewater_treatment" title="Wastewater treatment">Wastewater treatment</a></div>

<p>Wastewater treatment is the process that removes the majority of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contaminant" title="Contaminant">contaminants</a> from wastewater or <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> and produces both a liquid effluent suitable for disposal to the <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">natural environment</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Sludge" title="Sludge">sludge</a>. Biological processes can be employed in the treatment of wastewater and these processes may include, for example, <a href="/wiki/Aerated_lagoon" title="Aerated lagoon">aerated lagoons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Activated_sludge" title="Activated sludge">activated sludge</a> or <a href="/wiki/Slow_sand_filter" title="Slow sand filter">slow sand filters</a>. To be effective, sewage must be conveyed to a treatment plant by appropriate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sewage_collection_and_disposal" title="Sewage collection and disposal">pipes and infrastructure</a> and the process itself must be subject to regulation and controls. Some wastewaters require different and sometimes specialized treatment methods. At the simplest level, treatment of sewage and most wastewaters is carried out through separation of <a href="/wiki/Solid" title="Solid">solids</a> from <a href="/wiki/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a>, usually by <a href="/wiki/Sedimentation_(water_treatment)" title="Sedimentation (water treatment)">sedimentation</a>. By progressively converting dissolved material into solids, usually a biological floc, which is then settled out, an effluent stream of increasing purity is produced.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_water_and_wastewater_treatment">Industrial water and wastewater treatment</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Industrial_water_treatment" title="Industrial water treatment">Industrial water treatment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Industrial_wastewater_treatment" title="Industrial wastewater treatment">Industrial wastewater treatment</a></div>
<p>Two of the main processes of industrial water treatment are <i>boiler water treatment</i> and <i>cooling water treatment</i>. A lack of proper water treatment can lead to the reaction of solids and bacteria within pipe work and boiler housing. Steam boilers can suffer from scale or <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a> when left untreated. Scale deposits can lead to weak and dangerous machinery, while additional fuel is required to heat the same level of water because of the rise in thermal resistance. Poor quality dirty water can become a breeding ground for bacteria such as <i><a href="/wiki/Legionella" title="Legionella">Legionella</a></i> causing a risk to public health.</p>
<p>With the proper treatment, a significant proportion of industrial on-site wastewater might be reusable. This can save money in three ways: lower charges for lower water consumption, lower charges for the smaller volume of effluent water discharged and lower energy costs due to the recovery of heat in recycled wastewater.</p>
<p>Corrosion in low pressure boilers can be caused by dissolved oxygen, acidity and excessive alkalinity. Water treatment therefore should remove the dissolved oxygen and maintain the boiler water with the appropriate pH and alkalinity levels. Without effective water treatment, a cooling water system can suffer from scale formation, corrosion and fouling and may become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria. This reduces efficiency, shortens plant life and makes operations unreliable and unsafe.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Domestic_water_treatment">Domestic water treatment</span></h2>
<p>Water supplied to domestic properties may be further treated before use, often using an in-line treatment process. Such treatments can include <a href="/wiki/Water_softening" title="Water softening">water softening</a> or ion exchange. Many propriety systems also claim to remove residual disinfectants and <a href="/wiki/Toxic_heavy_metal" title="Toxic heavy metal">heavy metal</a> ions.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">Desalination</a></div>
<p>Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, <a href="/wiki/Reverse_osmosis" title="Reverse osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> or <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a>. Both methods require high energy inputs and are usually only used where fresh water is difficult to source.</p>

<p>Some industries such as the production of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silicon_wafer" title="Silicon wafer">silicon wafers</a>, space technology and many high quality <a href="/wiki/Metallurgy" title="Metallurgy">metallurgical</a> process require <a href="/wiki/Ultrapure_water" title="Ultrapure water">ultrapure water</a>.

<p>Early water treatment methods still used included sand filtration and chlorination. The first documented use of <a href="/wiki/Sand_filter" title="Sand filter">sand filters</a> to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paisley,_Scotland" title="Paisley, Scotland">Paisley, Scotland</a>, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. This method was refined in the following two decades, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by the <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Waterworks_Company" title="Chelsea Waterworks Company">Chelsea Waterworks Company</a> in London in 1829.</p>

<p>As of 2006, <a href="/wiki/Waterborne_diseases" title="Waterborne diseases">waterborne diseases</a> are estimated to have caused 1.8 million deaths each year. These deaths are attributable to inadequate public <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> systems and in these cases, proper <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sewerage</a> (or other options such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greywater_treatment" title="Greywater treatment">small-scale wastewater treatment</a>) that must be installed.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Appropriate_technology" title="Appropriate technology">Appropriate technology</a> options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Point-of-use" title="Point-of-use">point-of-use</a> (POU) designs. Such designs may employ <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SODIS" title="SODIS">solar water disinfection</a> methods, using solar irradiation to inactivate harmful waterborne microorganisms directly, mainly by the UV-A component of the solar spectrum, or indirectly through the presence of an oxide <a href="/wiki/Photocatalysis" title="Photocatalysis">photocatalyst</a>, typically supported <a href="/wiki/Titanium_dioxide" title="Titanium dioxide">TiO<sub>2</sub></a> in its <a href="/wiki/Anatase" title="Anatase">anatase</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rutile" title="Rutile">rutile</a> phases.

<p>For waterborne disease reduction to last, water treatment programs that research and development groups start in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> must be sustainable by the citizens of those countries. This can ensure the efficiency of such programs after the departure of the research team, as monitoring is difficult because of the remoteness of many locations.</p>
