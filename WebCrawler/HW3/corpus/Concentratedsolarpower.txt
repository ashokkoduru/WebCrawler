<p><b>Concentrated solar power</b> (also called <b>concentrating solar power</b>, <b>concentrated solar thermal</b>, and <b>CSP</b>) systems generate <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a> by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy" title="Solar thermal energy">solar thermal energy</a>, onto a small area. <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">Electricity</a> is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a <a href="/wiki/Heat_engine" title="Heat engine">heat engine</a> (usually a <a href="/wiki/Steam_turbine" title="Steam turbine">steam turbine</a>) connected to an electrical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_generator" title="Power generator">power generator</a>  or powers a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermochemical" title="Thermochemical">thermochemical</a> reaction (experimental as of 2013).</p>
<p>CSP is being widely commercialized and the CSP market saw about 740 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatt</a> (MW) of generating capacity added between 2007 and the end of 2010. More than half of this (about 478 MW) was installed during 2010, bringing the global total to 1095 MW. Spain added 400 MW in 2010, taking the global lead with a total of 632 MW, while the US ended the year with 509 MW after adding 78 MW, including two fossil–CSP hybrid plants. The Middle East is also ramping up their plans to install CSP based projects and as a part of that Plan, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shams_solar_power_station" title="Shams solar power station">Shams-I</a> which was the largest CSP Project in the world has been installed in Abu Dhabi, by <a href="/wiki/Masdar" title="Masdar">Masdar</a>. The largest CSP project in the world until January 2016 is <a href="/wiki/Ouarzazate_Solar_Power_Station" title="Ouarzazate Solar Power Station">Noor</a> in Morocco and global operational power stands at 4,705 MW.</p>
<p>There is considerable academic and commercial interest internationally in a new form of CSP, called STEM, for off-grid applications to produce 24-hour industrial scale power for mining sites and remote communities in <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, other parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and Latin America. STEM uses fluidized <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silica_sand" title="Silica sand">silica sand</a> as a thermal storage and <a href="/wiki/Heat_transfer" title="Heat transfer">heat transfer</a> medium for CSP systems. It has been developed by Salerno-based Magaldi Industries. The first commercial application of STEM was scheduled to take place in Sicily from 2015.</p>
<p>CSP growth is expected to continue at a fast pace. As of January 2014, Spain had a total capacity of 2,300 MW making this country the world leader in CSP. United States follows with 1,740 MW. Interest is also notable in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as India and China. In Italy, a handful of companies are trying to get authorization for 14 plants, totalling 392 MW, despite a strong local and political opposition. The global market has been dominated by parabolic-trough plants, which account for 90% of CSP plants.</p>
<p>CSP is not to be confused with <a href="/wiki/Concentrator_photovoltaics" title="Concentrator photovoltaics">concentrator photovoltaics</a> (CPV). In CPV, the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_effect" title="Photovoltaic effect">photovoltaic effect</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility" title="Ivanpah Solar Power Facility">Ivanpah</a> in California is running 69 percent below advertised power output, and one Spanish company, <a href="/wiki/Abengoa" title="Abengoa">Abengoa</a>, that commercialized CSP both in the US and abroad, is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. CSP technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics (solar panels), which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices of the panels. Another drawback of Ivanpah is that it lacks thermal energy storage, one of the big advantages that CSP has over PV and most other renewables, which require either large scale energy storage systems like pumped hydro or fast acting natural gas power plants to be there as backup for those times when they are not producing much energy.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>A legend has it that <a href="/wiki/Archimedes" title="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> used a "burning glass" to concentrate sunlight on the invading Roman fleet and repel them from <a href="/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily#Greek_period" title="Syracuse, Sicily">Syracuse</a>. In 1973 a Greek scientist, Dr. Ioannis Sakkas, curious about whether Archimedes could really have destroyed the Roman fleet in 212 BC, lined up nearly 60 Greek sailors, each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the sun's rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette 160 feet away. The ship caught fire after a few minutes; however, historians continue to doubt the Archimedes story.</p>
<p>In 1866, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auguste_Mouchout" title="Auguste Mouchout">Auguste Mouchout</a> used a parabolic trough to producе steam for the first solar steam engine. The first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the Italian Alessandro Battaglia in Genoa, Italy, in 1886. Over the following years, invеntors such as <a href="/wiki/John_Ericsson" title="John Ericsson">John Ericsson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Shuman" title="Frank Shuman">Frank Shuman</a> developed concentrating solar-powered dеvices for irrigation, refrigеration, and locomоtion. In 1913 Shuman finished a 55 HP parabolic <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy" title="Solar thermal energy">solar thermal energy</a> station in Maadi, Egypt for irrigation. The first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by <a href="/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard" title="Robert H. Goddard">Dr. R.H. Goddard</a>, who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed.</p>
<p>Professor Giovanni Francia (1911–1980) designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant, which entered into operation in Sant'Ilario, near Genoa, Italy in 1968. This plant had the architecture of today's concentrated-solar plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors. The plant was able to produce 1 MW with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500 °C. The 10 MW <a href="/wiki/The_Solar_Project" title="The Solar Project">Solar One</a> power tower was developed in Southern California in 1981, but the parabolic-trough technology of the nearby <a href="/wiki/Solar_Energy_Generating_Systems" title="Solar Energy Generating Systems">Solar Energy Generating Systems</a> (SEGS), begun in 1984, was more workable. The 354 MW SEGS is still the largest solar power plant in the world, and will remain so until the 390 MW Ivanpah power tower project reaches full power.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_technology">Current technology</span></h2>
<p>CSP is used to produce electricity (sometimes called solar thermoelectricity, usually generated through <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a>). Concentrated-solar technology systems use <a href="/wiki/Mirror" title="Mirror">mirrors</a> or <a href="/wiki/Lens_(optics)" title="Lens (optics)">lenses</a> with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optical_motion_tracking" title="Optical motion tracking">tracking</a> systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area. The concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_plant" title="Power plant">power plant</a> (solar thermoelectricity). The solar concentrators used in CSP systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling, such as in solar air-conditioning.</p>
<p>Concentrating technologies exist in five common forms, namely <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_trough" title="Parabolic trough">parabolic trough</a>, enclosed trough, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dish_Stirling" title="Dish Stirling">dish Stirlings</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compact_Linear_Fresnel_Reflector" title="Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector">concentrating linear Fresnel reflector</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_tower" title="Solar power tower">solar power tower</a>. Although simple, these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration. For example, the parabolic-trough concentration gives about ⅓ of the theoretical maximum for the design <a href="/wiki/Acceptance_angle_(solar_concentrator)" title="Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)">acceptance angle</a>, that is, for the same overall tolerances for the system. Approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on <a href="/wiki/Nonimaging_optics" title="Nonimaging optics">nonimaging optics</a>.</p>
<p>Different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies, due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light. New innovations in CSP technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Parabolic_trough">Parabolic trough</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_trough" title="Parabolic trough">Parabolic trough</a></div>
<p>A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid. The reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. A <a href="/wiki/Working_fluid" title="Working fluid">working fluid</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt" title="Molten salt">molten salt</a>) is heated to 150–350 °C (300–660 °F) as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system. Trough systems are the most developed CSP technology. The <a href="/wiki/Solar_Energy_Generating_Systems" title="Solar Energy Generating Systems">Solar Energy Generating Systems</a> (SEGS) plants in California, the world's first commercial parabolic trough plants, Acciona's <a href="/wiki/Nevada_Solar_One" title="Nevada Solar One">Nevada Solar One</a> near <a href="/wiki/Boulder_City,_Nevada" title="Boulder City, Nevada">Boulder City, Nevada</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Andasol" title="Andasol">Andasol</a>, Europe's first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative, along with <a href="/wiki/Plataforma_Solar_de_Almer%C3%ADa" title="Plataforma Solar de Almería">Plataforma Solar de Almería</a>'s SSPS-DCS test facilities in <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Spain" title="Solar power in Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Enclosed_trough">Enclosed trough</span></h4>
<p>The design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system. Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires. A <a href="/wiki/Solar_tracker" title="Solar tracker">single-axis tracking system</a> positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Water is carried throughout the length of the pipe, which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/GlassPoint_Solar" title="GlassPoint Solar">GlassPoint Solar</a>, the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enhanced_Oil_Recovery" title="Enhanced Oil Recovery">Enhanced Oil Recovery</a> (EOR) for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Solar_power_tower">Solar power tower</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_tower" title="Solar power tower">Solar power tower</a></div>

<p>A solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors (<a href="/wiki/Heliostat" title="Heliostat">heliostats</a>) that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower; the receiver contains a fluid deposit, which can consist of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea_water" title="Sea water">sea water</a>. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500–1000 °C (773–1,273 K (932–1,832 °F)) and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system. An advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower. Power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems, but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_Two" title="Solar Two">Solar Two</a> in <a href="/wiki/Daggett,_California" title="Daggett, California">Daggett</a>, California and the CESA-1 in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plataforma_Solar_de_Almeria" title="Plataforma Solar de Almeria">Plataforma Solar de Almeria</a> Almeria, Spain, are the most representative demonstration plants. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PS10_solar_power_tower" title="PS10 solar power tower">Planta Solar 10</a> (PS10) in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sanlucar_la_Mayor" title="Sanlucar la Mayor">Sanlucar la Mayor</a>, Spain, is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fresnel_reflectors">Fresnel reflectors</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compact_Linear_Fresnel_Reflector" title="Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector">Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector</a></div>
<p>Fresnel reflectors are made of many thin, flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped. Flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space as a parabolic reflector, thus capturing more of the available sunlight, and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors. Fresnel reflectors can be used in various size CSPs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dish_Stirling">Dish Stirling</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dish_Stirling" title="Dish Stirling">Dish Stirling</a></div>
<p>A dish Stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_reflector" title="Parabolic reflector">parabolic reflector</a> that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflector's focal point. The reflector tracks the Sun along two axes. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250–700 °C (480–1,300 °F) and then used by a <a href="/wiki/Stirling_engine" title="Stirling engine">Stirling engine</a> to generate power. Parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency (between 31% and 32%), and their modular nature provides scalability. The <a href="/wiki/Stirling_Energy_Systems" title="Stirling Energy Systems">Stirling Energy Systems</a> (SES), <a href="/wiki/United_Sun_Systems_International" title="United Sun Systems International">United Sun Systems</a> (USS) and <a href="/wiki/Science_Applications_International_Corporation" title="Science Applications International Corporation">Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)</a> dishes at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas" title="University of Nevada, Las Vegas">UNLV</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Australian_National_University" title="Australian National University">Australian National University</a>'s <a href="/wiki/The_Big_Dish_(solar_thermal)" title="The Big Dish (solar thermal)">Big Dish</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canberra" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, Australia are representative of this technology.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery">Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery</a></div>
<p>Heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump. Solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced. Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump.</p>

<p>The commercial deployment of CSP plants started by 1984 in the US with the <a href="/wiki/Solar_Energy_Generating_Systems" title="Solar Energy Generating Systems">SEGS</a> plants. The last SEGS plant was completed in 1990. From 1991 to 2005 no CSP plants were built anywhere in the world. Global installed CSP-capacity has increased nearly tenfold since 2004 and grew at an average of 50 percent per year during the last five years. In 2013, worldwide installed capacity increased by 36 percent or nearly 0.9 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">gigawatt</a> (GW) to more than 3.4 GW. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Spain" title="Solar power in Spain">Spain</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_States" title="Solar power in the United States">United States</a> remained the global leaders, while the number of countries with installed CSP were growing. There is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation.</p>
<p>CSP is also increasingly competing with the cheaper <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> solar power and with <a href="/wiki/Concentrator_photovoltaics" title="Concentrator photovoltaics">concentrator photovoltaics</a> (CPV), a fast-growing technology that just like CSP is suited best for regions of high solar insolation. In addition, a novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system has been proposed recently.</p>

<p>The graph shows that the overall efficiency does not increase steadily with the receiver's temperature. Although the heat engine's efficiency (Carnot) increases with higher temperature, the receiver's efficiency does not. On the contrary, the receiver's efficiency is decreasing, as the amount of energy it cannot absorb (Q<sub>lost</sub>) grows by the fourth power as a function of temperature. Hence, there is a maximum reachable temperature. When the receiver efficiency is null (blue curve on the figure below), T<sub>max</sub> is: <span><span class="mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y" style="display: none;"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

<p>There is a temperature T<sub>opt</sub> for which the efficiency is maximum, i.e. when the efficiency derivative relative to the receiver temperature is null:</p>

<p>Consequently, this leads us to the following equation:</p>

<p>Theoretical efficiencies aside, real-world experience of CSP reveals a 25-60 percent shortfall in projected production. A pilot 5 megawatt CSP power tower, <a href="/wiki/The_Solar_Project#Solar_One" title="The Solar Project">Solar One</a>, was converted to a 10 megawatt CSP power tower, <a href="/wiki/The_Solar_Project#Solar_Two" title="The Solar Project">Solar Two</a>, decommissioned in 1999. Due to the success of Solar Two, a commercial power plant, called <a href="/wiki/Gemasolar_Thermosolar_Plant" title="Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant">Solar Tres Power Tower</a>, was built in Spain, renamed Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant. Gemasolar brilliant results have paved the way for the <a href="/wiki/Crescent_Dunes_Solar_Energy_Project" title="Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project">Crescent Dunes project</a>. Ivanpah difficulties arise also from not having considered the lessons about the benefits of thermal storage. <a href="/wiki/Solana_Generating_Station" title="Solana Generating Station">Solana</a> in Arizona is 25 percent below projected numbers, Ivanpah in California, is 40 percent below projected numbers. A slightly bigger <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_station" title="Photovoltaic power station">photovoltaic power station</a>, like the 290 MW <a href="/wiki/Agua_Caliente_Solar_Project" title="Agua Caliente Solar Project">Agua Caliente Solar Project</a> peaked at most to 741 GW·h in 2014, comparing with the 280 MW Solana growing 719 GW·h. Lower insolation related to a solar minimum is part of the problem, but there is clearly a technical issue with rating these systems or simply a commercial overstatement. Indeed, an other operator, that of the 280 MW <a href="/wiki/Genesis_Solar_Energy_Project" title="Genesis Solar Energy Project">Genesis Solar</a>, projected only 580 GW·h production and instead made 621 GW·h in 2015. CSP once thought to be economically superior to photovoltaics, in 2015 it has proven not to be the case. Recent PV commercial power is selling for ⅓ recent CSP contracts.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Costs">Costs</span></h2>
<p>As of 9 September 2009, the cost of building a CSP station was typically about US$2.50 to $4 per watt, while the fuel (the sun's radiation) is free. Thus a 250 MW CSP station would have cost $600–1000 million to build. That works out to $0.12 to <span class="nowrap">0.18 USD/kWh.</span> New CSP stations may be economically competitive with fossil fuels. Nathaniel Bullard, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, has calculated that the cost of electricity at the <a href="/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility" title="Ivanpah Solar Power Facility">Ivanpah Solar Power Facility</a>, a project under construction in Southern California, will be lower than that from photovoltaic power and about the same as that from natural gas. However, in November 2011, Google announced that they would not invest further in CSP projects due to the rapid price decline of <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a>. Google invested US$168 million on BrightSource. <a href="/wiki/International_Renewable_Energy_Agency" title="International Renewable Energy Agency">IRENA</a> has published on June 2012 a series of studies titled: "Renewable Energy Cost Analysis". The CSP study shows the cost of both building and operation of CSP plants. Costs are expected to decrease, but there are insufficient installations to clearly establish the learning curve. As of March 2012, there were 1.9 GW of CSP installed, with 1.8 GW of that being parabolic trough.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Incentives">Incentives</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spain">Spain</span></h3>
<p>Solar-thermal electricity generation is eligible for feed-in tariff payments (art. 2 RD 661/2007), if the system capacity does not exceed the following limits: Systems registered in the register of systems prior to 29 September 2008: 500 MW for solar-thermal systems. Systems registered after 29 September 2008 (PV only). The capacity limits for the different system types are re-defined during the review of the application conditions every quarter (art. 5 RD 1578/2008, Annex III RD 1578/2008). Prior to the end of an application period, the market caps specified for each system type are published on the website of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade (art. 5 RD 1578/2008).</p>
<p>Since 27 January 2012, Spain has halted acceptance of new projects for the feed-in-tariff. Projects currently accepted are not affected, except that a 6% tax on feed-in-tariffs has been adopted, effectively reducing the feed-in-tariff.</p>

<p>At the federal level, under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET), in operation under the Renewable Energy Electricity Act 2000, large scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited RET power stations may be entitled to create large-scale generation certificates (LGCs). These certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities (usually electricity retailers) to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme. However, as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation, it tends to favour more established RE technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation, such as large scale onshore wind, rather than solar thermal and CSP. At State level, renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kWp, and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar PV (photovoltaic) generation. This means that larger scale CSP projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the State and Territory jurisdictions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Future">Future</span></h2>
<p>A study done by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenpeace_International" title="Greenpeace International">Greenpeace International</a>, the European Solar Thermal Electricity Association, and the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a>'s <a href="/wiki/SolarPACES" title="SolarPACES">SolarPACES</a> group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power. The study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25% of the world's energy needs by 2050. The increase in investment would be from 2 billion euros worldwide to 92.5 billion euros in that time period. Spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology, with more than 50 government-approved projects in the works. Also, it exports its technology, further increasing the technology's stake in energy worldwide. Because the technology works best with areas of high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insolation" title="Insolation">insolation</a> (solar radiation), experts predict the biggest growth in places like Africa, Mexico, and the southwest United States. It indicates that the thermal storage systems based in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrates" title="Nitrates">nitrates</a> (<a href="/wiki/Calcium_nitrate" title="Calcium nitrate">calcium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potassium_nitrate" title="Potassium nitrate">potassium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sodium_nitrate" title="Sodium nitrate">sodium</a>,...) will make the CSP plants more and more profitable. The study examined three different outcomes for this technology: no increases in CSP technology, investment continuing as it has been in Spain and the US, and finally the true potential of CSP without any barriers on its growth. The findings of the third part are shown in the table below:</p>

<p>Finally, the study acknowledged how technology for CSP was improving and how this would result in a drastic price decrease by 2050. It predicted a drop from the current range of €0.23–0.15/kwh to €0.14–0.10/kwh. Recently the EU has begun to look into developing a €400 billion ($774 billion) network of solar power plants based in the Sahara region using CSP technology known as <a href="/wiki/Desertec" title="Desertec">Desertec</a>, to create "a new carbon-free network linking Europe, the Middle East and North Africa". The plan is backed mainly by German industrialists and predicts production of 15% of Europe's power by 2050. <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> is a major partner in Desertec and as it has barely 1% of the electricity consumption of the EU, it will produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to Europe.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> has the biggest area of desert, and private Algerian firm <a href="/wiki/Cevital" title="Cevital">Cevital</a> has signed up for <a href="/wiki/Desertec" title="Desertec">Desertec</a>. With its wide desert (the highest CSP potential in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions ~ about 170 TWh/year) and its strategic geographical location near Europe <a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> is one of the key countries to ensure the success of Desertec project. Moreover, with the abundant natural-gas reserve in the Algerian desert, this will strengthen the technical potential of Algeria in acquiring <a href="/wiki/Hassi_R%27Mel_integrated_solar_combined_cycle_power_station" title="Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station">Solar-Gas Hybrid Power Plants</a> for 24-hour electricity generation.</p>
<p>Other organizations expect CSP to cost $0.06(US)/kWh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment. That would make CSP as cheap as conventional power. Investors such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Venture_capitalist" title="Venture capitalist">venture capitalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Vinod_Khosla" title="Vinod Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a> expect CSP to continuously reduce costs and actually be cheaper than coal power after 2015.</p>
<p>On 9 September 2009<span class="noprint">; 7 years ago</span><span style="display:none"> (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2009-09-09</span>)</span>, Bill Weihl, <a href="/wiki/Google.org" title="Google.org">Google.org</a>'s green-energy spokesperson said that the firm was conducting research on the heliostat mirrors and gas turbine technology, which he expects will drop the cost of solar thermal electric power to less than $0.05/kWh in 2 or 3 years.</p>
<p>In 2009, scientists at the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL) and <a href="/wiki/SkyFuel" title="SkyFuel">SkyFuel</a> teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30% less expensive than today's best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a <a href="/wiki/Silver" title="Silver">silver</a> polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors, but at much lower cost and weight. It also is much easier to deploy and install. The glossy film uses several layers of polymers, with an inner layer of pure silver.</p>
<p>Telescope designer <a href="/wiki/Roger_Angel" title="Roger Angel">Roger Angel</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Univ._of_Arizona" title="Univ. of Arizona">Univ. of Arizona</a>) has turned his attention to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Concentrated_photovoltaics" title="Concentrated photovoltaics">CPV</a>, and is a partner in a company called Rehnu. Angel utilizes a spherical concentrating lens with large-telescope technologies, but much cheaper materials and mechanisms, to create efficient systems.</p>
<p>Recent experience with CSP technology in 2014 - 2015 at Solana in Arizona, and Ivanpah in Nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25 and 40 percent. Producers blame clouds and stormy weather, but critics seem to think there are technological issues. These problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity, and threaten the long-term viability of the technology. As photovoltaic costs continue to plummet, many think CSP has a limited future in utility-scale electricity production. On the other side, part of photovoltaic costs drop is the result of the fossil fuel cost reductions, which still powers most of PV production. Instead CSP would be unaffected when fossil prices return to higher quotes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Very_large_scale_solar_power_plants">Very large scale solar power plants</span></h2>
<p>There are several proposals for gigawatt size, very large scale solar power plants. They include the Euro-Mediterranean <a href="/wiki/Desertec" title="Desertec">Desertec</a> proposal, Project Helios in Greece (10 gigawatt), and Ordos (2 gigawatt) in China. A 2003 study concluded that the world could generate 2,357,840 TWh each year from very large scale solar power plants using 1% of each of the world's deserts. Total consumption worldwide was 15,223 TWh/year (in 2003). The gigawatt size projects are arrays of single plants. The largest single plant in operation is the 370 MW <a href="/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility" title="Ivanpah Solar Power Facility">Ivanpah Solar</a>. In 2012, the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management" title="Bureau of Land Management">BLM</a> made available 97,921,069 acres (39,627,251 hectares) of land in the <a href="/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern United States</a> for solar projects, enough for between 10,000 and 20,000 gigawatts (GW).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effect_on_wildlife">Effect on wildlife</span></h2>

<p>It has been noted that insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology, and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed (burned) if the birds fly near the point where light is being focused onto. This can also affect raptors who hunt the birds. Federal wildlife officials have begun calling these power towers "mega traps" for wildlife.</p>
<p>However, the story about the <a href="/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility" title="Ivanpah Solar Power Facility">Ivanpah Solar Power Facility</a> was exaggerated, numbering the deaths in many tens of thousands, spreading alarm about concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, which was not grounded in facts, but on one opponent's speculation. According to rigorous reporting, in over six months, actually only 133 singed birds were counted. By focusing no more than 4 mirrors on any one place in the air during standby, at <a href="/wiki/Crescent_Dunes_Solar_Energy_Project" title="Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project">Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project</a>, in 3 months, the death rate dropped to zero fatalities.</p>
