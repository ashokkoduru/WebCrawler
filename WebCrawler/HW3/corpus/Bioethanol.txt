<p>Most transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a>. This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a>. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">Ethanol fuel</a> is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_Brazil" title="Ethanol fuel in Brazil">in Brazil</a>. <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_fuel" title="Alcohol fuel">Alcohol fuels</a> are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beets</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sugar_cane" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a> and any sugar or starch from which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Whiskey" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a>, can be made (such as <a href="/wiki/Potato" title="Potato">potato</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a> waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are <a href="/wiki/Digestive_enzyme" title="Digestive enzyme">enzyme digestion</a> (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a> and drying.

<p>Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a> than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol (<span class="chemf nowrap">CH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidizer" title="Oxidizer">oxidizer</a> to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.</p>
<p>Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fireplaces" title="Fireplaces">fireplaces</a>. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue. The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of <a href="/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic ethanol</a>. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy, the fossil energy ratios (<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Fossil_Energy_Ratio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Fossil Energy Ratio (page does not exist)">FER</a>) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.</p>
<p>Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1-26 % more energy efficient than petrol cars <a class="external text" href="http://www.best-europe.org/" rel="nofollow">The BEST project</a>), but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required.</p>
<p>With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">Biodiesel</a> is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a> and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters (<a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid_methyl_ester" title="Fatty acid methyl ester">FAMEs</a>). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soy" title="Soy">soy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rapeseed" title="Rapeseed">rapeseed</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jatropha_curcas" title="Jatropha curcas">jatropha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madhuca_longifolia" title="Madhuca longifolia">mahua</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mustard_plant" title="Mustard plant">mustard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flax" title="Flax">flax</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a>, <a href="/wiki/Palm_oil" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thlaspi_arvense" title="Thlaspi arvense">field pennycress</a>, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pongamia_pinnata" title="Pongamia pinnata">Pongamia pinnata</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Algae_fuel" title="Algae fuel">algae</a>. Pure biodiesel (B100) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel <a class="external text" href="https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/" rel="nofollow">Second generation B100</a>.</p>
<p>Biodiesel can be used in any <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a> when mixed with mineral diesel. In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> of <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100. B100 may become more <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscous</a> at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '<a href="/wiki/Viton" title="Viton">Viton</a>' (by <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont</a>) synthetic rubber in their mechanical <a href="/wiki/Fuel_injection" title="Fuel injection">fuel injection</a> systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using neat biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.</p>
<p>Electronically controlled '<a href="/wiki/Common_rail" title="Common rail">common rail</a>' and '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unit_Injector" title="Unit Injector">unit injector</a>' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fuel_rail" title="Fuel rail">fuel rail</a> design. Since biodiesel is an effective <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, <a href="/wiki/Oil_filter" title="Oil filter">engine filters</a> may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine <a href="/wiki/Combustion_chamber" title="Combustion chamber">combustion chamber</a> of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. Biodiesel is also an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxygenated_diesel" title="Oxygenated diesel">oxygenated fuel</a>, meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a> of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using neat biodiesel may increase NOx-emissions <a class="external text" href="http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf" rel="nofollow">Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013. Fuel and Technology Alternatives for Buses. Overall Energy Efficiency and Emission Performance. IEA Bioenergy Task 46</a>. Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NOx-levels also when using B100.</p>
<p>Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biodegradable" title="Biodegradable">biodegradable</a>, and has a high <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash point</a> of about 300 °F (148 °C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125 °F (52 °C).</p>
<p>In the USA, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005. "By the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold [from 2004] to more than" 1 billion US gallons (3,800,000 m).</p>

Due to the design of the combustion chambers in <a href="/wiki/Indirect_injection" title="Indirect injection">indirect injection</a> engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil.

<p>The European Fuel Oxygenates Association (EFOA) credits Methyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether (MTBE) and Ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE) as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were brought into fuels in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound. Although Europeans still use Bio-ether additives, the US no longer has an oxygenate requirement therefore bio-ethers are no longer used as the main fuel additive.</p>

<p>Examples include <a href="/wiki/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sawdust" title="Sawdust">sawdust</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grass</a> trimmings, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domestic_waste" title="Domestic waste">domestic refuse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agricultural_waste" title="Agricultural waste">agricultural waste</a>, nonfood <a href="/wiki/Energy_crop" title="Energy crop">energy crops</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dry_animal_dung_fuel" title="Dry animal dung fuel">dried manure</a>.</p>
<p>When raw biomass is already in a suitable form (such as <a href="/wiki/Firewood" title="Firewood">firewood</a>), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When raw biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 in), which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wood_pellet" title="Wood pellet">wood pellets</a>, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet, and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.</p>
<p>Industry has used sawdust, bark and chips for fuel for decades, primary in the pulp and paper industry, and also bagasse (spent sugar cane) fueled boilers in the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000 lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low cost fuel.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry. In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.</p>
<p>A problem with the combustion of raw biomass is that it emits considerable amounts of <a href="/wiki/Pollutant" title="Pollutant">pollutants</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_particulate_matter" title="Atmospheric particulate matter">particulates</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons" title="Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</a>. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of <a href="/wiki/Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds" title="Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds">dioxins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chlorophenol" title="Chlorophenol">chlorophenols</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of the above noted study, numerous studies have shown biomass fuels have significantly less impact on the environment than fossil based fuels. Of note is the US Department of Energy Laboratory, operated by Midwest Research Institute Biomass Power and Conventional Fossil Systems with and without CO2 Sequestration – Comparing the <a href="/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested" title="Energy returned on energy invested">Energy Balance</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_Gas" title="Greenhouse Gas">Greenhouse Gas</a> Emissions and Economics Study. Power generation emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs), mainly <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>). <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CO2_sequestration" title="CO2 sequestration">Sequestering</a> CO<sub>2</sub> from the power plant <a href="/wiki/Flue_gas" title="Flue gas">flue gas</a> can significantly reduce the GHGs from the power plant itself, but this is not the total picture. CO<sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration consumes additional energy, thus lowering the plant's <a href="/wiki/Fuel_efficiency" title="Fuel efficiency">fuel-to-electricity efficiency</a>. To compensate for this, more fossil fuel must be procured and consumed to make up for lost capacity.</p>
<p>Taking this into consideration, the <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">global warming potential</a> (GWP), which is a combination of CO<sub>2</sub>, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions, and energy balance of the system need to be examined using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment" title="Life cycle assessment">life cycle assessment</a>. This takes into account the upstream processes which remain constant after CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration, as well as the steps required for additional power generation.

<p>The challenge is to support biofuel development, including the development of new <a href="/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic technologies</a>, with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable" title="Sustainable">sustainable</a>.

It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.</p>
<p>Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected.

<p>Plant Research International, a department of the <a href="/wiki/Wageningen_University_and_Research_Centre" title="Wageningen University and Research Centre">Wageningen University and Research Centre</a> in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large-scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments. The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fungi">Fungi</span></h3>
<p>A group at the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Russian Academy of Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, <i><a href="/wiki/Cunninghamella" title="Cunninghamella">Cunninghamella</a></i> <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Cunninghamella_japonica&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Cunninghamella japonica (page does not exist)">japonica</a></i>, and others, is likely to appear in the near future. The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gliocladium_roseum" title="Gliocladium roseum">Gliocladium roseum</a></i> (later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides) points toward the production of so-called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Myco-diesel" title="Myco-diesel">myco-diesel</a> from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern <a href="/wiki/Patagonia" title="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel. Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms, suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future (reviewed in ).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Animal_gut_bacteria">Animal gut bacteria</span></h3>
<p>Microbial <a href="/wiki/Gut_flora" title="Gut flora">gastrointestinal flora</a> in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of <i><a href="/wiki/Clostridium" title="Clostridium">Clostridium</a></i> bacteria found in Zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel. Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels" title="Biofuels">biofuels</a> from bamboo and other plant materials. There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Greenhouse_gas_emissions">Greenhouse gas emissions</span></h3>
<p>Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions. The payback period, that is, the time it will take biofuels to pay back the carbon debt they acquire due to land-use change, has been estimated to be between 100 and 1000 years, depending on the specific instance and location of land-use change. However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.</p>
<p>A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO<sub>2</sub>, while losing 53-105 Mg CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO<sub>2</sub>, while losing 48-90 Mg CO<sub>2</sub> to be sequestered from forest depletion. The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO<sub>2</sub> than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.</p>

<p>In addition to water required to grow crops, biofuel facilities require significant process water.</p>
