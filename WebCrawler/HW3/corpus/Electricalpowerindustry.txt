<p>The <b>electric power industry</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">generation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">transmission</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_distribution" title="Electric power distribution">distribution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electricity_retailing" title="Electricity retailing">sale</a> of <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" title="Electric power">electric power</a> to the general public. The electrical industry started with introduction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_lighting" title="Electric lighting">electric lighting</a> in 1882. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry. Once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable and economical electric power has become a requirement for normal operation of all elements of developed economies.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 20th century, electric power was seen as a "<a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a>", only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically-integrated companies provides all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, many regions have opened up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive <a href="/wiki/Electricity_market" title="Electricity market">electricity market</a>. While such markets can be abusively <a href="/wiki/Market_manipulation" title="Market manipulation">manipulated</a> with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since <a href="/wiki/Return_on_investment" title="Return on investment">returns on investment</a> are not as easy to find.</p>
<p>The largest electric power companies in the world that deal with all aspects of production and sales of electric power are:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>


<p>Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an <a href="/wiki/Electrolytic_cell" title="Electrolytic cell">electrolytic cell</a> since <a href="/wiki/Alessandro_Volta" title="Alessandro Volta">Alessandro Volta</a> developed the <a href="/wiki/Voltaic_pile" title="Voltaic pile">voltaic pile</a> in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Faraday" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">US</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed <a href="/wiki/Direct_current" title="Direct current">direct current</a> electricity.</p>
<p>The world's first public electricity supply was provided in late 1881, when the streets of the <a href="/wiki/Surrey" title="Surrey">Surrey</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Godalming" title="Godalming">Godalming</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> were lit with electric light. This system was powered from a water wheel on the <a href="/wiki/River_Wey" title="River Wey">River Wey</a>, which drove a Siemens <a href="/wiki/Alternator" title="Alternator">alternator</a> that supplied a number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arc_lamps" title="Arc lamps">arc lamps</a> within the town. This supply scheme also provided electricity to a number of shops and premises to light 34 incandescent Swan light bulbs.</p>
<p>Additionally, Robert Hammond, in December 1881, demonstrated the new electric light in the <a href="/wiki/Sussex" title="Sussex">Sussex</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Brighton" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> in the UK for a trial period. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. Thus the Hammond Electricity Supply Co. was launched. Whilst the Godalming and Holborn Viaduct Schemes closed after a few years the Brighton Scheme continued on, and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day.</p>
<p>In early 1882, Edison opened the world’s first steam-powered electricity generating station at <a href="/wiki/Holborn_Viaduct" title="Holborn Viaduct">Holborn Viaduct</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, where he had entered into an agreement with the City Corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting. In time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light. The method of supply was direct current (DC).</p>
<p>It was later on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pearl_Street_Power_Station" title="Pearl Street Power Station">Pearl Street Power Station</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. Increasing the <a href="/wiki/Voltage" title="Voltage">voltage</a> reduces the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Current_(electricity)" title="Current (electricity)">current</a> and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the <a href="/wiki/Electric_shock" title="Electric shock">danger from direct contact</a> and increases the required <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_insulation" title="Electrical insulation">insulation</a> thickness. Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison's system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.</p>
<p>The mid to late 1880's saw the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Alternating_current" title="Alternating current">alternating current</a> (AC) systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that <a href="/wiki/Transformer" title="Transformer">transformers</a>, installed at <a href="/wiki/Power_station" title="Power station">power stations</a>, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local <a href="/wiki/Electrical_substation" title="Electrical substation">substations</a> could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. This made it more economical to distribute power over long distances. Generators (such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> sites) could be located far from the loads. AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the <a href="/wiki/War_of_Currents" title="War of Currents">War of Currents</a>. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out.</p>

<p>The AC power system used today developed rapidly, backed by industrialists such as <a href="/wiki/George_Westinghouse" title="George Westinghouse">George Westinghouse</a> with <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Dolivo-Dobrovolsky" title="Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky">Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Ferraris" title="Galileo Ferraris">Galileo Ferraris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Ziani_de_Ferranti" title="Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti">Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lucien_Gaulard" title="Lucien Gaulard">Lucien Gaulard</a>, John Dixon Gibbs, <a href="/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Siemens" title="Carl Wilhelm Siemens">Carl Wilhelm Siemens</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_Stanley,_Jr." title="William Stanley, Jr.">William Stanley, Jr.</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, and others contributed to this field.</p>
<p>While <a href="/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current" title="High-voltage direct current">high-voltage direct current</a> (HVDC) is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asynchronous" title="wikt:asynchronous">asynchronous</a> power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Market_reform">Market reform</span></h2>
<p>There has such as transmission and distribution sectors from the contestable sectors of generation and retailing across the world. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">generators</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electricity_retailing" title="Electricity retailing">retailers</a> trading electricity in a similar manner to <a href="/wiki/Share_(finance)" title="Share (finance)">shares</a> and <a href="/wiki/Currency" title="Currency">currency</a>. As <a href="/wiki/Deregulation" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> continues further, utilities are driven to sell their <a href="/wiki/Asset" title="Asset">assets</a> as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Futures_market" title="Futures market">futures</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spot_market" title="Spot market">spot markets</a> and other financial arrangements. Even <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a> with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was the when <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK’s</a> <a href="/wiki/National_Grid_plc" title="National Grid plc">National Grid</a>, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>’s electric system for $3.2 billion. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_flight" title="Space flight">space flight</a>; aeroderivative <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">gas turbines</a> used in <a href="/wiki/Jet_aircraft" title="Jet aircraft">jet aircraft</a>; solar engineering and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.</p>
<p>Electricity is expected to see growing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_demand" title="Energy demand">demand</a> in the future. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Information_Revolution" title="Information Revolution">Information Revolution</a> is highly reliant on electric power. Other growth areas include emerging new electricity-exclusive technologies, developments in space conditioning, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_process" title="Industrial process">industrial processes</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transportation" title="Transportation">transportation</a> (for example <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle" title="Hybrid vehicle">hybrid vehicles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" title="Locomotive">locomotives</a>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>
<p>The electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes. These are <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a> such as a <a href="/wiki/Power_station" title="Power station">power station</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">electric power transmission</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electricity_distribution" title="Electricity distribution">electricity distribution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electricity_retailing" title="Electricity retailing">electricity retailing</a>. In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a <a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a>. The industry is generally heavily <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulated</a>, often with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Price_control" title="Price control">price controls</a> and is frequently <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government-owned_corporation" title="Government-owned corporation">government-owned and operated</a>.</p>
<p>The nature and state of market reform of the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_market" title="Electricity market">electricity market</a> often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure, or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end-users of electricity may opt for more costly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_electricity" title="Green electricity">green electricity</a>.</p>

<p>All forms of electricity generation have positive and negative aspects. <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">Technology</a> will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market economy</a>, the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources. It is not clear yet which form can best meet the necessary energy demands or which process can best solve the demand for electricity. There are indications that <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Distributed_generation" title="Distributed generation">distributed generation</a> are becoming more viable in economic terms. A diverse mix of generation sources reduces the risks of electricity price spikes.</p>

<p>The organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country. In some places, all electric power generation, transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization. Other regions have private or investor-owned utility companies, city or municipally owned companies, <a href="/wiki/Utility_cooperative" title="Utility cooperative">cooperative</a> companies owned by their own customers, or combinations. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system.</p>
