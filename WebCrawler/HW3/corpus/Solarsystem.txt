<p>The <b>Solar System</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravitationally</a> bound system comprising the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the <a href="/wiki/Planet" title="Planet">planets</a>, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_planet" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Small_Solar_System_body" title="Small Solar System body">small Solar System bodies</a>. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">moons</a>, two are larger than the smallest planet, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>.</p>
<p>The Solar System <a href="/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System" title="Formation and evolution of the Solar System">formed 4.6 billion years ago</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" title="Gravitational collapse">gravitational collapse</a> of a giant interstellar <a href="/wiki/Molecular_cloud" title="Molecular cloud">molecular cloud</a>. The vast majority of the system's <a href="/wiki/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The four smaller inner planets, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>, <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, are <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_planet" title="Terrestrial planet">terrestrial planets</a>, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are <a href="/wiki/Giant_planet" title="Giant planet">giant planets</a>, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, are <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>, being composed mainly of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>; the two outermost planets, <a href="/wiki/Uranus" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>, are <a href="/wiki/Ice_giant" title="Ice giant">ice giants</a>, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called <a href="/wiki/Volatiles" title="Volatiles">ices</a>, such as water, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the <a href="/wiki/Ecliptic" title="Ecliptic">ecliptic</a>.</p>
<p>The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The <a href="/wiki/Asteroid_belt" title="Asteroid belt">asteroid belt</a>, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_belt" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scattered_disc" title="Scattered disc">scattered disc</a>, which are populations of <a href="/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object" title="Trans-Neptunian object">trans-Neptunian objects</a> composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of <a href="/wiki/Sednoid" title="Sednoid">sednoids</a>. Within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity. Such objects are categorized as <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_planet" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planets</a>. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid <a href="/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" title="Ceres (dwarf planet)">Ceres</a> and the trans-Neptunian objects <a href="/wiki/Pluto" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)" title="Eris (dwarf planet)">Eris</a>. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including <a href="/wiki/Comet" title="Comet">comets</a>, <a href="/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)" title="Centaur (minor planet)">centaurs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interplanetary_dust_cloud" title="Interplanetary dust cloud">interplanetary dust</a>, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">natural satellites</a>, usually termed "moons" after the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a>. Each of the outer planets is encircled by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Planetary_ring" title="Planetary ring">planetary rings</a> of dust and other small objects.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a> known as the <a href="/wiki/Heliosphere" title="Heliosphere">heliosphere</a>. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heliopause_(astronomy)" title="Heliopause (astronomy)">heliopause</a> is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar wind</a>; it extends out to the edge of the <a href="/wiki/Scattered_disc" title="Scattered disc">scattered disc</a>.

<p>For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>â€“<a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a> and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> philosopher <a href="/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos" title="Aristarchus of Samos">Aristarchus of Samos</a> had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, <a href="/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> was the first to develop a mathematically predictive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heliocentric" title="Heliocentric">heliocentric</a> system. In the 17th century, <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>, <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> developed an understanding of <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of <a href="/wiki/Unmanned_spacecraft" title="Unmanned spacecraft">unmanned spacecraft</a> have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mountains" title="Mountains">mountains</a>, <a href="/wiki/Impact_crater" title="Impact crater">craters</a>, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clouds" title="Clouds">clouds</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dust_storms" title="Dust storms">dust storms</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ice_caps" title="Ice caps">ice caps</a> on the other planets.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure_and_composition">Structure and composition</span></h2>
<p>The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a <a href="/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" title="G-type main-sequence star">G2 main-sequence star</a> that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the <a href="/wiki/Giant_planet" title="Giant planet">giant planets</a>, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_planet" title="Terrestrial planet">terrestrial planets</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_planet" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planets</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_moons" title="List of moons">moons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asteroid" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Comet" title="Comet">comets</a>) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.</p>
<p>Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the <a href="/wiki/Ecliptic" title="Ecliptic">ecliptic</a>. The planets are very close to the ecliptic, whereas comets and <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_belt" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a> objects are frequently at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets and most other objects orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Retrograde_motion" title="Retrograde motion">exceptions</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet" title="Halley's Comet">Halley's Comet</a>.</p>
<p>The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.</p>

<p>Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">natural satellites</a>, or moons (two of which, <a href="/wiki/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)" title="Ganymede (moon)">Ganymede</a>, are larger than the planet <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>), and, in the case of the four giant planets, by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Planetary_ring" title="Planetary ring">planetary rings</a>, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Synchronous_rotation" title="Synchronous rotation">synchronous rotation</a>, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion" title="Kepler's laws of planetary motion">Kepler's laws of planetary motion</a> describe the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an <a href="/wiki/Ellipse" title="Ellipse">ellipse</a> with the Sun at one <a href="/wiki/Focus_(geometry)" title="Focus (geometry)">focus</a>. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi-major_axis" title="Semi-major axis">semi-major axes</a>) travel more quickly because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Perihelion" title="Perihelion">perihelion</a></i>, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aphelion" title="Aphelion">aphelion</a></i>. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using <a href="/wiki/Numerical_model_of_the_Solar_System" title="Numerical model of the Solar System">numerical models</a>.</p>
<p>Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum" title="Angular momentum">angular momentum</a>. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.</p>
<p>The Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, which comprise nearly all the remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_pressure" title="Light pressure">light pressure</a> from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense is known as the <a href="/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics)" title="Frost line (astrophysics)">frost line</a>, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.</p>
<p>The objects of the inner Solar System are composed mostly of rock, the collective name for compounds with high melting points, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silicates" title="Silicates">silicates</a>, iron or nickel, that remained solid under almost all conditions in the <a href="/wiki/Protoplanetary_nebula" title="Protoplanetary nebula">protoplanetary nebula</a>. Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases, the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vapour_pressure" title="Vapour pressure">vapour pressure</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neon" title="Neon">neon</a>, which were always in the gaseous phase in the nebula. Ices, like <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, have melting points up to a few hundred kelvins. They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in the solid or gaseous phase. Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and Neptune (the so-called "<a href="/wiki/Ice_giant" title="Ice giant">ice giants</a>") and the numerous small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Together, gases and ices are referred to as <i><a href="/wiki/Volatiles" title="Volatiles">volatiles</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Distances_and_scales">Distances and scales</span></h3>
<p>The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">astronomical unit</a> (150,000,000Â <a href="/wiki/Kilometre" title="Kilometre">km</a>), or AU. For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047Â AU (700,000Â km). Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10Â %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000Â km) from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000Â km (0.00047Â AU), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30Â AU (4.5<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">Ã—</span>10Â km) from the Sun.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the <a href="/wiki/Titius%E2%80%93Bode_law" title="Titiusâ€“Bode law">Titiusâ€“Bode law</a>), but no such theory has been accepted. The images at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Solar_System_model" title="Solar System model">Solar System models</a> attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanicalâ€”called <a href="/wiki/Orrery" title="Orrery">orreries</a>)â€”whereas others extend across cities or regional areas. The largest such scale model, the <a href="/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System" title="Sweden Solar System">Sweden Solar System</a>, uses the 110-metre (361-ft) <a href="/wiki/Ericsson_Globe" title="Ericsson Globe">Ericsson Globe</a> in <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arlanda_International_Airport" title="Arlanda International Airport">Arlanda International Airport</a>, 40Â km (25Â mi) away, whereas the farthest current object, <a href="/wiki/90377_Sedna" title="90377 Sedna">Sedna</a>, is a 10-cm (4-in) sphere in <a href="/wiki/Lule%C3%A5" title="LuleÃ¥">LuleÃ¥</a>, 912Â km (567Â mi) away.</p>
<p>If the Sunâ€“Neptune distance is <a href="/wiki/Solar_System_model" title="Solar System model">scaled</a> to 100 metres, then the Sun would be about 3Â cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3Â mm, and Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3Â mm) at this scale.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System" title="Formation and evolution of the Solar System">Formation and evolution of the Solar System</a></div>
<p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large <a href="/wiki/Molecular_cloud" title="Molecular cloud">molecular cloud</a>. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_nebula" title="Solar nebula">pre-solar nebula</a>, collapsed, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum" title="Conservation of angular momentum">conservation of angular momentum</a> caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protoplanetary_disc" title="Protoplanetary disc">protoplanetary disc</a> with a diameter of roughly 200Â <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">AU</a> and a hot, dense <a href="/wiki/Protostar" title="Protostar">protostar</a> at the centre. The planets formed by <a href="/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics)" title="Accretion (astrophysics)">accretion</a> from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover <a href="/wiki/Small_Solar_System_body" title="Small Solar System body">minor bodies</a>.</p>

<p>Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the <a href="/wiki/Asteroid_belt" title="Asteroid belt">asteroid belt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_belt" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" title="Oort cloud">Oort cloud</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Nice_model" title="Nice model">Nice model</a> is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.</p>
<p>Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" title="Nuclear fusion">thermonuclear fusion</a>. The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until <a href="/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium" title="Hydrostatic equilibrium">hydrostatic equilibrium</a> was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a <a href="/wiki/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main-sequence</a> star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stellar_remnant" title="Stellar remnant">remnant</a> life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the <a href="/wiki/Heliosphere" title="Heliosphere">heliosphere</a> and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.</p>
<p>The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a <a href="/wiki/Red_giant" title="Red giant">red giant</a>. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and Venus and render Earth uninhabitable as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone">habitable zone</a> moves out to the orbit of Mars. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a <a href="/wiki/White_dwarf" title="White dwarf">white dwarf</a>, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a <a href="/wiki/Planetary_nebula" title="Planetary nebula">planetary nebula</a>, returning some of the material that formed the Sunâ€”but now enriched with <a href="/wiki/Metallicity" title="Metallicity">heavier elements</a> like carbonâ€”to the interstellar medium.</p>

<p>The Sun is the Solar System's <a href="/wiki/Star" title="Star">star</a> and by far its most massive component.

<p>The Sun is a <a href="/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" title="G-type main-sequence star">G2-type main-sequence star</a>. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the <a href="/wiki/O-type_main-sequence_star" title="O-type main-sequence star">hottest stars</a> and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as <a href="/wiki/Red_dwarf" title="Red dwarf">red dwarfs</a>, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The Sun is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_I_stars" title="Population I stars">population I star</a>; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("<a href="/wiki/Metallicity" title="Metallicity">metals</a>" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> because the planets form from the accretion of "metals".</p>

Activity on the Sun's surface, such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_flare" title="Solar flare">solar flares</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection" title="Coronal mass ejection">coronal mass ejections</a>, disturb the heliosphere, creating <a href="/wiki/Space_weather" title="Space weather">space weather</a> and causing <a href="/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm" title="Geomagnetic storm">geomagnetic storms</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comets">Comets</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Comet" title="Comet">Comet</a></div>

<p>Comets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)" title="Sublimation (chemistry)">sublimate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ion" title="Ion">ionise</a>, creating a <a href="/wiki/Coma_(cometary)" title="Coma (cometary)">coma</a>: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as <a href="/wiki/Comet_Hale%E2%80%93Bopp" title="Comet Haleâ€“Bopp">Haleâ€“Bopp</a>, are thought to originate in the <a href="#Oort_cloud">Oort cloud</a>. Many comet groups, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kreutz_Sungrazers" title="Kreutz Sungrazers">Kreutz Sungrazers</a>, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory" title="Hyperbolic trajectory">hyperbolic</a> orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult.

The entire region is still <a href="/wiki/Timeline_of_Solar_System_exploration" title="Timeline of Solar System exploration">largely unexplored</a>. It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worldsâ€”the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moonâ€”composed mainly of rock and ice.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_belt" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a></div>


<p>The Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50Â AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as <a href="/wiki/50000_Quaoar" title="50000 Quaoar">Quaoar</a>, <a href="/wiki/20000_Varuna" title="20000 Varuna">Varuna</a>, and <a href="/wiki/90482_Orcus" title="90482 Orcus">Orcus</a>, may prove to be dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50Â km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.</p>
<p>The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the "<a href="/wiki/Classical_Kuiper_belt_object" title="Classical Kuiper belt object">classical</a>" belt and the <a href="/wiki/Resonant_trans-Neptunian_object" title="Resonant trans-Neptunian object">resonances</a>.

<p>The scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends much further outwards, is thought to be the source of short-period comets.

Most scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150Â AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as "scattered Kuiper belt objects".

<p>The heliosphere is a <a href="/wiki/Stellar-wind_bubble" title="Stellar-wind bubble">stellar-wind bubble</a>, a region of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400Â km/s its <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>, a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a>.</p>
<p>The collision occurs at the <i>termination shock</i>, which is roughly 80â€“100Â AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200Â AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the <i>heliosheath</i>. This structure is thought to look and behave very much like a comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40Â AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cassini_(spacecraft)" title="Cassini (spacecraft)">Cassini</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_Boundary_Explorer" title="Interstellar Boundary Explorer">Interstellar Boundary Explorer</a> spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.</p>
<p>The outer boundary of the heliosphere, the <i>heliopause</i>, is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space. <a href="/wiki/Voyager_1" title="Voyager 1">Voyager 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/Voyager_2" title="Voyager 2">Voyager 2</a> are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84Â AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.</p>
<p>The shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the <a href="/wiki/Fluid_dynamics" title="Fluid dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_magnetic_field" title="Solar magnetic field">solar magnetic fields</a> prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9Â AU farther than the southern hemisphere.

He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed "distant detached objects" (DDOs), which also may include the object <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/(148209)_2000_CR105" title="(148209) 2000 CR105">2000 CR<sub>105</sub></a></span>, which has a perihelion of 45Â AU, an aphelion of 415Â AU, and an orbital period of 3,420 years. Brown terms this population the "inner Oort cloud" because it may have formed through a similar process, although it is far closer to the Sun. Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined. The second unequivocally detached object, with a perihelion farther than Sedna's at roughly 81 AU, is <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/2012_VP113" title="2012 VP113">2012 VP<span style="position: relative; top: 0.3em;"><span style="font-size:80%;">113</span></span></a></span>, discovered in 2012. Its aphelion is only half that of Sedna's, at 400â€“500 AU.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" title="Oort cloud">Oort cloud</a></div>

<p>The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000Â AU (around 1Â <a href="/wiki/Light-year" title="Light-year">light-year</a> (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000Â AU (1.87Â ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_tide" title="Galactic tide">galactic tide</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" title="Tidal force">tidal force</a> exerted by the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>.</p>

<p>Much of the Solar System is still unknown. The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars" title="List of nearest stars">surrounding stars</a> out to about two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU. Despite discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, an area tens of thousands of AU in radius, is still virtually unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and the Sun. Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions.</p>
<p>Currently, the furthest known objects, such as <a href="/wiki/Comet_West" title="Comet West">Comet West</a> have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun, but as the Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Galactic_context">Galactic context</span></h2>

<p>The Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a <a href="/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy" title="Barred spiral galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> with a diameter of about 100,000 <a href="/wiki/Light-year" title="Light-year">light-years</a> containing about 200 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orion%E2%80%93Cygnus_Arm" title="Orionâ€“Cygnus Arm">Orionâ€“Cygnus Arm</a> or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galactic_Centre" title="Galactic Centre">Galactic Centre</a>, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220Â km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225â€“250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's <a href="/wiki/Galactic_year" title="Galactic year">galactic year</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Solar_apex" title="Solar apex">solar apex</a>, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation <a href="/wiki/Hercules_(constellation)" title="Hercules (constellation)">Hercules</a> in the direction of the current location of the bright star <a href="/wiki/Vega" title="Vega">Vega</a>. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60Â° to the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_plane" title="Galactic plane">galactic plane</a>.</p>
<p>The Solar System's location in the Milky Way is a factor in the <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_life" title="Evolutionary history of life">evolutionary history of life</a> on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of <a href="/wiki/Supernova" title="Supernova">supernovae</a>, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the <a href="#Oort_cloud">Oort cloud</a> and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Neighbourhood">Neighbourhood</span></h3>

<p>The Solar System is in the <a href="/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud" title="Local Interstellar Cloud">Local Interstellar Cloud</a> or Local Fluff. It is thought to be near the neighbouring <a href="/wiki/G-Cloud" title="G-Cloud">G-Cloud</a> but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the <a href="/wiki/Local_Bubble" title="Local Bubble">Local Bubble</a>, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a> roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.</p>
<p>There are relatively few <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars" title="List of nearest stars">stars within ten light-years of the Sun</a>. The closest is the triple star system <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>, which is about 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small <a href="/wiki/Red_dwarf" title="Red dwarf">red dwarf</a>, <a href="/wiki/Proxima_Centauri" title="Proxima Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable <a href="/wiki/Exoplanet" title="Exoplanet">exoplanet</a> was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called <a href="/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b" title="Proxima Centauri b">Proxima Centauri b</a>, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun. The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs <a href="/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star" title="Barnard's Star">Barnard's Star</a> (at 5.9Â ly), <a href="/wiki/Wolf_359" title="Wolf 359">Wolf 359</a> (7.8Â ly), and <a href="/wiki/Lalande_21185" title="Lalande 21185">Lalande 21185</a> (8.3Â ly).</p>
<p>The largest nearby star is <a href="/wiki/Sirius" title="Sirius">Sirius</a>, a bright <a href="/wiki/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main-sequence</a> star roughly 8.6 light-years away and roughly twice the Sun's mass and that is orbited by a <a href="/wiki/White_dwarf" title="White dwarf">white dwarf</a>, Sirius B. The nearest <a href="/wiki/Brown_dwarf" title="Brown dwarf">brown dwarfs</a> are the binary <a href="/wiki/Luhman_16" title="Luhman 16">Luhman 16</a> system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system <a href="/wiki/Luyten_726-8" title="Luyten 726-8">Luyten 726-8</a> (8.7Â ly) and the solitary red dwarf <a href="/wiki/Ross_154" title="Ross 154">Ross 154</a> (9.7Â ly). The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is <a href="/wiki/Tau_Ceti" title="Tau Ceti">Tau Ceti</a> at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity. The closest known <a href="/wiki/Rogue_planet" title="Rogue planet">free-floating planetary-mass object</a> to the Sun is <a href="/wiki/WISE_0855%E2%88%920714" title="WISE 0855âˆ’0714">WISE 0855âˆ’0714</a>, an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses roughly 7 light-years away.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_with_other_planetary_systems">Comparison with other planetary systems</span></h3>
<p>Compared to other <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary systems</a> the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury. The known Solar System also lacks <a href="/wiki/Super-Earth" title="Super-Earth">super-Earths</a> (<a href="/wiki/Planet_Nine" title="Planet Nine">Planet Nine</a> could be a super-Earth beyond the known Solar System). Uncommonly, it has only small rocky planets and large gas giants; elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typicalâ€”both rocky and gasâ€”so there is no "gap" as seen between the size of Earth and of Neptune (with a radius 3.8 times as large). Also, these super-Earths have closer orbits than Mercury. This led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection.</p>
<p>The orbits of Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller <a href="/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity" title="Orbital eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a>. Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.</p>
