<p>The <b>Millennium Development Goals</b> (<b>MDGs</b>) were the eight <a href="/wiki/International_development" title="International development">international development</a> <a href="/wiki/Goal" title="Goal">goals</a> for the year 2015 that had been established following the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Summit" title="Millennium Summit">Millennium Summit</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in 2000, following the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Millennium_Declaration" title="United Nations Millennium Declaration">United Nations Millennium Declaration</a>. All 189 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_member_states" title="United Nations member states">United Nations member states</a> at that time, and at least 22 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_organizations" title="International organizations">international organizations</a>, committed to help achieve the following Millennium Development Goals by 2015:</p>
<ol>
<li>To eradicate <a href="/wiki/Extreme_poverty" title="Extreme poverty">extreme poverty</a> and hunger</li>
<li>To achieve <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universal_primary_education" title="Universal primary education">universal primary education</a></li>
<li>To promote <a href="/wiki/Gender_equality" title="Gender equality">gender equality</a> and empower women</li>
<li>To reduce <a href="/wiki/Child_mortality" title="Child mortality">child mortality</a></li>
<li>To improve <a href="/wiki/Maternal_health" title="Maternal health">maternal health</a></li>
<li>To combat <a href="/wiki/HIV/AIDS" title="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, and other diseases</li>
<li>To ensure environmental sustainability</li>
<li>To develop a global partnership for development</li>
</ol>
<p>Each goal had specific targets, and dates for achieving those targets. To accelerate progress, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/G8" title="G8">G8</a> finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and the <a href="/wiki/African_Development_Bank" title="African Development Bank">African Development Bank</a> (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55 billion in debt owed by members of the <a href="/wiki/Heavily_indebted_poor_countries" title="Heavily indebted poor countries">heavily indebted poor countries</a> (HIPC) to allow them to redirect resources to programs for improving health and education and for alleviating poverty.</p>
<p>Critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. Although developed countries' aid for achieving the MDGs rose during the challenge period, more than half went for debt relief and much of the remainder going towards <a href="/wiki/Natural_disaster" title="Natural disaster">natural disaster</a> relief and military aid, rather than further development.</p>
<p>As of 2013, progress towards the goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. A UN conference in September 2010 reviewed progress to date and adopted a global plan to achieve the eight goals by their target date. New commitments targeted women's and children's health, and new initiatives in the worldwide battle against poverty, hunger and disease.</p>
<p>Among the non-governmental organizations assisting were the United Nations Millennium Campaign, the Millennium Promise Alliance, Inc., the Global Poverty Project, the <a href="/wiki/Micah_Challenge_UK" title="Micah Challenge UK">Micah Challenge</a>, The Youth in Action EU Programme, "Cartoons in Action" video project and the 8 Visions of Hope global art project.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals" title="Sustainable Development Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) replaced the MDGs in 2016.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Millennium_Summit">Millennium Summit</span></h3>
<p>Preparations for the 2000 <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Summit" title="Millennium Summit">Millennium Summit</a> launched with the report of the Secretary-General entitled, "We the people: The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-First Century". Additional input was prepared by the Millennium Forum, which brought together representatives of over 1,000 non-governmental and civil society organizations from more than 100 countries. The Forum met in May to conclude a two-year consultation process covering issues such as <a href="/wiki/Poverty_reduction" title="Poverty reduction">poverty eradication</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_protection" title="Environmental protection">environmental protection</a>, human rights and protection of the <a href="/wiki/Social_vulnerability" title="Social vulnerability">vulnerable</a>.</p>
<p>MDGs derive from earlier development targets, where world leaders adopted the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Millennium_Declaration" title="United Nations Millennium Declaration">United Nations Millennium Declaration</a>. The approval of the Millennium Declaration was the main outcome of the Millennium Summit.</p>
<p>The MDGs originated from the United Nations <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Millennium_Declaration" title="Millennium Declaration">Millennium Declaration</a>. The Declaration asserted that every individual has dignity; and hence, the right to freedom, equality, a basic standard of living that includes freedom from hunger and violence and encourages tolerance and solidarity. The MDGs set concrete targets and indicators for poverty reduction in order to achieve the rights set forth in the Declaration.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Precursors">Precursors</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Report_of_the_Panel_on_United_Nations_Peacekeeping" title="Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping">Brahimi Report</a> provided the basis of the goals in the area of peace and security.</p>
<p>The Millennium Summit Declaration was, however, only part of the origins of the MDGs. More ideas came from Adam Figueroa, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organization_for_Economic_Cooperation_and_Development" title="Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (OECD), the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> and the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>. A series of UN‑led conferences in the 1990s focused on issues such as children, nutrition, human rights and women. The OECD criticized major donors for reducing their levels of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Official_Development_Assistance" title="Official Development Assistance">Official Development Assistance</a> (ODA). UN Secretary General <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> signed a report titled, <i>We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century</i>. The OECD had formed its International Development Goals (IDGs). The two efforts were combined for the World Bank's 2001 meeting to form the MDGs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_capital.2C_infrastructure_and_human_rights">Human capital, infrastructure and human rights</span></h3>
<p>The MDGs emphasized three areas: <a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a>, <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> and human rights (<a href="/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights" title="Economic, social and cultural rights">social, economic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights" title="Civil and political rights">political</a>), with the intent of increasing living standards. Human capital objectives include nutrition, healthcare (including <a href="/wiki/Child_mortality" title="Child mortality">child mortality</a>, <a href="/wiki/HIV/AIDS" title="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_health" title="Reproductive health">reproductive health</a>) and education. Infrastructure objectives include access to safe drinking water, energy and modern information/communication technology; increased farm outputs using sustainable practices; transportation; and environment. Human rights objectives include empowering women, reducing violence, increasing political voice, ensuring equal access to public services and increasing security of property rights. The goals were intended to increase an individual’s <a href="/wiki/Capability_approach" title="Capability approach">human capabilities</a> and "advance the means to a productive life". The MDGs emphasize that each nation's policies should be tailored to that country's needs; therefore most policy suggestions are general.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Partnership">Partnership</span></h3>
<p>MDGs emphasize the role of developed countries in aiding developing countries, as outlined in Goal Eight, which sets objectives and targets for developed countries to achieve a "global partnership for development" by supporting <a href="/wiki/Fair_trade" title="Fair trade">fair trade</a>, debt relief, increasing aid, access to affordable essential medicines and encouraging technology transfer. Thus developing nations ostensibly became partners with developed nations in the struggle to reduce world poverty.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goals">Goals</span></h2>

<p>The MDGs were developed out of several commitments set forth in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Millennium_Declaration" title="Millennium Declaration">Millennium Declaration</a>, signed in September 2000.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="General">General</span></h3>
<p>General criticisms include a perceived lack of analytical power and justification behind the chosen objectives.</p>
<p>The MDGs lack strong objectives and indicators for within-country equality, despite significant disparities in many developing nations.</p>
<p>Iterations of proven local successes should be scaled up to address the larger need through human energy and existing resources using methodologies such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Participatory_Rural_Appraisal" title="Participatory Rural Appraisal">Participatory Rural Appraisal</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asset_Based_Community_Development" title="Asset Based Community Development">Asset Based Community Development</a>, or <a href="/wiki/SEED-SCALE" title="SEED-SCALE">SEED-SCALE</a>.</p>
<p>MDG 8 uniquely focuses on donor achievements, rather than development successes. The <i><a href="/wiki/Commitment_to_Development_Index" title="Commitment to Development Index">Commitment to Development Index</a></i>, published annually by the <a href="/wiki/Center_for_Global_Development" title="Center for Global Development">Center for Global Development</a> in Washington, D.C., is considered the best numerical indicator for MDG 8. It is a more comprehensive measure of donor progress than official development assistance, as it takes into account policies on a number of indicators that affect developing countries such as trade, migration and investment.</p>
<p>The MDGs were attacked for insufficient emphasis on environmental <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a>. Thus, they do not capture all elements needed to achieve the ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration.</p>
<p>Agriculture was not specifically mentioned in the MDGs even though most of the world's poor are farmers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alleged_lack_of_legitimacy">Alleged lack of legitimacy</span></h3>
<p>The entire MDG process has been accused of lacking <a href="/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)" title="Legitimacy (political)">legitimacy</a> as a result of failure to include, often, the voices of the very participants that the MDGs seek to assist. The <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=International_Planning_Committee_for_Food_Sovereignty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (page does not exist)">International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty</a>, in its Post 2015 thematic consultation document on MDG 69 states "The major limitation of the MDGs by 2015 was the lack of political will to implement due to the lack of ownership of the MDGs by the most affected constituencies".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_rights">Human rights</span></h3>
<p>The MDGs may under-emphasize local participation and empowerment (other than women’s empowerment). FIAN International, a human rights organization focusing on the right to adequate food, contributed to the Post 2015 process by pointing out a lack of: "primacy of human rights; qualifying policy coherence; and of human rights based monitoring and <a href="/wiki/Accountability" title="Accountability">accountability</a>. Without such accountability, no substantial change in national and international policies can be expected."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_capital">Human capital</span></h3>
<p>MDG 2 focuses on primary education and emphasizes enrollment and completion. In some countries, primary enrollment increased at the expense of achievement levels. In some cases, the emphasis on primary education has negatively affected secondary and post-secondary education.</p>
<p>A publication from 2005 argued that goals related to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maternal_mortality" title="Maternal mortality">maternal mortality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> are impossible to measure and that current UN estimates lack scientific validity or are missing. Household surveys are the primary measure for the health MDGs but may be poor and duplicative measurements that consume limited resources. Furthermore, countries with the highest levels of these conditions typically have the least reliable data collection. The study also argued that without accurate measures, it is impossible to determine the amount of progress, leaving MDGs as little more than a rhetorical call to arms.</p>
<p>MDG proponents such as McArthur and Sachs countered that setting goals is still valid despite measurement difficulties, as they provide a political and operational framework to efforts. With an increase in the quantity and quality of healthcare systems in developing countries, more data could be collected. They asserted that non-health related MDGs were often well measured, and that not all MDGs were made moot by lack of data.</p>
<p>The attention to well being other than income helps bring funding to achieving MDGs. Further MDGs prioritize interventions, establish obtainable objectives with useful measurements of progress despite measurement issues and increased the developed world’s involvement in worldwide poverty reduction. MDGs include gender and reproductive rights, environmental sustainability, and spread of technology. Prioritizing interventions helps developing countries with limited resources make decisions about allocating their resources. MDGs also strengthen the commitment of developed countries and encourage aid and information sharing. The global commitment to the goals likely increases the likelihood of their success. They note that MDGs are the most broadly supported poverty reduction targets in world history.</p>
<p>Achieving the MDGs does not depend on economic growth alone. In the case of MDG 4, developing countries such as <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> have shown that it is possible to reduce child mortality with only modest growth with inexpensive yet effective interventions, such as <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> immunization. Still, government expenditure in many countries is not enough to meet the agreed spending targets. Research on health systems suggests that a "one size fits all" model will not sufficiently respond to the individual healthcare profiles of developing countries; however, the study found a common set of constraints in scaling up international health, including the lack of absorptive capacity, weak health systems, human resource limitations, and high costs. The study argued that the emphasis on coverage obscures the measures required for expanding health care. These measures include political, organizational, and functional dimensions of scaling up, and the need to nurture local organizations.</p>
<p>Fundamental issues such as gender, the divide between the humanitarian and development agendas and economic growth will determine whether or not the MDGs are achieved, according to researchers at the <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> (ODI).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Health_Partnership" title="International Health Partnership">International Health Partnership</a> (IHP+) aimed to accelerate MDG progress by applying international principles for effective aid and development in the health sector. In developing countries, significant funding for health came from external sources requiring governments to coordinate with international development partners. As partner numbers increased variations in funding streams and bureaucratic demands followed. By encouraging support for a single national health strategy, a single monitoring and evaluation framework, and mutual accountability, IHP+ attempted to build confidence between government, civil society, development partners and other health stakeholders.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Equity">Equity</span></h3>
<p>Further developments in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include research by the <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> into the role of <a href="/wiki/Equity_(economics)" title="Equity (economics)">equity</a>. Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a <a href="/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle" title="Virtuous circle and vicious circle">virtuous circle</a> where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability. Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Equity_(legal_concept)" title="Equity (legal concept)">political</a>.

<p>The effects of increasing drug use were noted by the <i>International Journal of Drug Policy</i> as a deterrent to the goal of the MDGs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Women.27s_issues">Women's issues</span></h3>
<p>Increased focus on gender issues could accelerate MDG progress, e.g. empowering women through access to paid work could help reduce child mortality. In <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asian</a> countries babies often suffered from <a href="/wiki/Low_birth_weight" title="Low birth weight">low birth weight</a> and high mortality due to limited access to healthcare and maternal <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>. Paid work could increase women's access to health care and better nutrition, reducing child mortality. Increasing female education and workforce participation increased these effects. Improved economic opportunities for women also decreased participation in the sex market, which decreased the spread of AIDS, MDG 6A. Another way in which women can be empowered is through access to paid work. Kabeer states that this access increases women’s agency in their households, it does so in the economic and political spheres as well. A study of women in rural Mexico found that those of them engaged in industrial work were able to negotiate and obtain a greater degree of respect in their households. Additionally, another study from Tanzania found that increased access to paid work led to a long-term reduction in domestic violence. Lastly, Women’s employment and access to financial resources increased their political participation. Data from Bangladesh indicates that longer membership in microfinance organizations have many positive effects including higher levels of political participation and improved access to government programs.</p>
<p>Although the resources, technology and knowledge exist to decrease poverty through improving gender equality, the political will is often missing. If donor and developing countries focused on seven "priority areas", great progress could be made towards the MDG. These seven priority areas include: increasing girls’ completion of secondary school, guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health rights, improving infrastructure to ease women’s and girl’s time burdens, guaranteeing women’s property rights, reducing gender inequalities in employment, increasing seats held by <a href="/wiki/Women_in_government" title="Women in government">women in government</a>, and combating violence against women.</p>
<p>It is thought that the current MDGs targets do not place enough emphasis on tracking gender inequalities in poverty reduction and employment as there are only gender goals relating to health, education, and political representation. To encourage women’s empowerment and progress towards the MDGs, increased emphasis should be placed on gender mainstreaming development policies and collecting data based on gender.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Progress">Progress</span></h2>

<p>Progress towards reaching the goals has been uneven across countries. <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> achieved many of the goals, while others, such as <a href="/wiki/Benin" title="Benin">Benin</a>, are not on track to realize any. The major successful countries include China (whose <a href="/wiki/Poverty_in_China" title="Poverty in China">poverty population</a> declined from 452 million to 278 million) and India. The <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> estimated that MDG 1A (halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day) was achieved in 2008 mainly due to the results from these two countries and East Asia.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s <a href="/wiki/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> was one of the world's poorest countries and remains South Asia's poorest country. Doubling health spending and concentrating on its poorest areas halved maternal mortality between 1998 and 2006. Its <a href="/wiki/Multidimensional_Poverty_Index" title="Multidimensional Poverty Index">Multidimensional Poverty Index</a> has seen the largest decreases of any tracked country. <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> has made some of the greatest improvements in infant and maternal mortality ever seen, despite modest income growth.</p>
<p>Between 1990 and 2010 the population living on less than $1.25 a day in developing countries halved to 21%, or 1.2 billion people, achieving MDG1A before the target date, although the biggest decline was in China, which took no notice of the goal. However, the child mortality and maternal mortality are down by less than half. Sanitation and education targets will also be missed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Multilateral_debt_reduction">Multilateral debt reduction</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/G8" title="G8">G‑8</a> Finance Ministers met in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> in June 2005 in preparation for the <a href="/wiki/31st_G8_summit" title="31st G8 summit">Gleneagles Summit</a> in July and agreed to provide enough funds to the World Bank, IMF and the <a href="/wiki/African_Development_Bank" title="African Development Bank">African Development Bank</a> (AfDB) to cancel an additional the remaining HIPC multilateral debt ($40 to $55 billion). Recipients would theoretically re-channel debt payments to health and education.</p>
<p>The Gleaneagles plan became the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Multilateral_Debt_Relief_Initiative&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (page does not exist)">Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative</a> (MDRI). Countries became eligible once their lending agency confirmed that the countries had continued to maintain the reforms they had implemented.</p>
<p>While the World Bank and AfDB limited MDRI to countries that complete the HIPC program, the IMF's eligibility criteria were slightly less restrictive so as to comply with the IMF's unique "uniform treatment" requirement. Instead of limiting eligibility to HIPC countries, any country with <a href="/wiki/Per_capita_income" title="Per capita income">per capita income</a> of $380 or less qualified for debt cancellation. The IMF adopted the $380 threshold because it closely approximated the HIPC threshold.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sub-Saharan_Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</span></h3>
<p>One success was to strengthen rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa. By the mid‑1990s, rice imports reached nearly $1 billion annually. Farmers had not found suitable rice varieties that produce high yields. <a href="/wiki/New_Rice_for_Africa" title="New Rice for Africa">New Rice for Africa</a> (NERICA), a high-yielding and well adapted strain, was developed and introduced in areas including Congo Brazzaville, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Togo and Uganda. Some 18 varieties of this strain became available, enabling African farmers to produce enough rice to feed their families and have extra to sell.</p>
<p>The region also showed progress towards MDG 2. School fees that included Parent-Teacher Association and community contributions, textbook fees, compulsory uniforms and other charges took up nearly a quarter of a poor family’s income and led countries including <a href="/wiki/Burundi" title="Burundi">Burundi</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ghana" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malawi" title="Malawi">Malawi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mozambique" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tanzania" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Uganda" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> to eliminate such fees, increasing enrollment. For instance, in Ghana, public school enrollment in the most deprived districts rose from 4.2 million to 5.4 million between 2004 and 2005. In Kenya, primary school enrollment added 1.2 million in 2003 and by 2004, the number had climbed to 7.2 million.</p>

<p>Malaria deaths declined by more than one-third, saving millions of lives.</p>
<p>Although developed countries' financial aid rose during the Millennium Challenge, more than half went towards debt relief. Much of the remainder aid money went towards disaster relief and military aid. According to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Department_of_Economic_and_Social_Affairs" title="United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs">United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs</a> (2006), the 50 least developed countries received about one third of all aid that flows from developed countries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Funding_commitment">Funding commitment</span></h3>
<p>Over the past 35 years, UN members have repeatedly "commit[ted] 0.7% of rich-countries' <a href="/wiki/Measures_of_national_income_and_output" title="Measures of national income and output">gross national income</a> (GNI) to <a href="/wiki/Official_development_assistance" title="Official development assistance">Official Development Assistance</a>". The commitment was first made in 1970 by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_General_Assembly" title="UN General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a>.</p>
<p>The text of the commitment was:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a> and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0.7 percent of its gross national product at market prices by the middle of the decade.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="European_Union">European Union</span></h4>
<p>In 2005 the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> reaffirmed its commitment to the 0.7% aid targets, noting that "four out of the five countries, which exceed the UN target for ODA of 0.7%, of GNI are member states of the European Union". Further, the UN "believe[s] that donors should commit to reaching the long-standing target of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2015".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<p>However, the United States as well as other nations disputed the <a href="/wiki/Monterrey_Consensus" title="Monterrey Consensus">Monterrey Consensus</a> that urged "developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) as ODA to developing countries".</p>
<p>The US consistently opposed setting specific foreign-aid targets since the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> first endorsed the 0.7% goal in 1970.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="OECD">OECD</span></h4>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD) nations, did not donate 0.7% of their GNI. Some nations' contributions fell far short of 0.7%.</p>
<p>The Australian government committed to providing 0.5% of GNI in International Development Assistance by 2015-2016.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Review_Summit_2010">Review Summit 2010</span></h3>
<p>A major conference was held at UN headquarters in New York on 20–22 September 2010 to review progress. The conference concluded with the adoption of a global action plan to accelerate progress towards the eight anti-poverty goals. Major new commitments on women's and children's health, poverty, hunger and disease ensued.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Libraries_and_the_Millennium_Development_Goals">Libraries and the Millennium Development Goals</span></h3>
<p>Librarians and others in the information professions are in a unique position to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It is often the dissemination of key information, e.g., about health, that changes daily life and can affect an entire community.</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals are not only for the developing world. Maret (2011) specifically addresses how U.S. public libraries can help the United States meet the goals. The work of U.S. librarians has evolved in a manner that incorporates human rights values and precepts without having generally used the language that characterizes the philosophical and ethical goals of human rights and human development. Librarians are able to further the Millennium Development Goals and contribute by providing information and services to all people in varying formats and languages.</p>
<p>Albright and Kwooya (2007) report that cultural and financial barriers in Sub-Saharan Africa impede LIS education programs. As a result, MDG goals for poverty, healthcare, and education fall short. High rates of HIV/AIDS, and escalating child and maternal mortality are the direct result of poverty and substandard medical care. Limited instruction in information access and exchange contributes to this ongoing dilemma.</p>
