<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> emerged as an independent sovereign state in the <a href="/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages" title="Early Middle Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, <a href="/wiki/James_VI_and_I" title="James VI and I">James VI</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Scottish_monarchs" title="List of Scottish monarchs">King of Scots</a>, became <a href="/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs#House_of_Stuart" title="List of English monarchs">King of England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Monarchy_of_Ireland#Monarchs_of_Ireland" title="Monarchy of Ireland">King of Ireland</a>, thus forming a <a href="/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns" title="Union of the Crowns">personal union of the three kingdoms</a>.

(The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Union" title="Treaty of Union">Treaty of Union</a> was agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin <a href="/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union 1707</a>, passed by the Parliaments of both kingdoms, despite popular opposition and anti-union riots in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, and elsewhere).

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Monarchy of the United Kingdom">monarchy of the United Kingdom</a> continues to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union Scotland, including: the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Standard_of_Scotland" title="Royal Standard of Scotland">Royal Standard of Scotland</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom">Royal coat of arms</a> used in Scotland together with its associated <a href="/wiki/Royal_Standard_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Royal Standard of the United Kingdom">Royal Standard</a>, royal titles including that of <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Rothesay" title="Duke of Rothesay">Duke of Rothesay</a>, certain <a href="/wiki/Great_Officer_of_State" title="Great Officer of State">Great Officers of State</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chivalric_order" title="Chivalric order">chivalric</a> <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle" title="Order of the Thistle">Order of the Thistle</a> and, since 1999, reinstating a ceremonial role for the <a href="/wiki/Crown_of_Scotland" title="Crown of Scotland">Crown of Scotland</a> after a 292-year hiatus.

<p>Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesolithic_period" title="Mesolithic period">Mesolithic period</a>. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the <a href="/wiki/Last_glacial_period" title="Last glacial period">last glaciation</a>.</p>

<p>The groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of <a href="/wiki/Skara_Brae" title="Skara Brae">Skara Brae</a> on the mainland of <a href="/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> dates from this period. <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Isles" title="Northern Isles">Northern Isles</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Western_Isles" title="Western Isles">Western Isles</a>, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1850, a severe storm hit Scotland, causing widespread damage and over 200 deaths. In the Bay of Skaill, the storm stripped the earth from a large irregular knoll, known as "Skerrabra". When the storm cleared, local villagers found the outline of a village, consisting of a number of small houses without roofs. William Watt of Skaill, the local <a href="/wiki/Laird" title="Laird">laird</a>, began an amateur excavation of the site, but after uncovering four houses, the work was abandoned in 1868. The site remained undisturbed until 1913, when during a single weekend the site was plundered by a party with shovels who took away an unknown quantity of artefacts. In 1924, another storm swept away part of one of the houses and it was determined the site should be made secure and more seriously investigated.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Scotland_during_the_Roman_Empire" title="Scotland during the Roman Empire">Scotland during the Roman Empire</a></div>

<p>The written <a href="/wiki/Protohistory" title="Protohistory">protohistory</a> of Scotland began with the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in southern and central Great Britain, when the Romans occupied what is now England and Wales, administering it as a province called <i><a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Britannia</a></i>. Roman invasions and occupations of southern Scotland were a series of brief interludes.</p>
<p>According to the Roman historian <a href="/wiki/Tacitus" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Caledonians" title="Caledonians">Caledonians</a> "turned to armed resistance on a large scale", attacking Roman forts and skirmishing with their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Legion" title="Roman Legion">legions</a>. In a surprise night-attack, the Caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/9th_Legion" title="9th Legion">9th Legion</a> until it was saved by Agricola's cavalry.</p>
<p>In AD 83–84, the General <a href="/wiki/Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola" title="Gnaeus Julius Agricola">Gnaeus Julius Agricola</a> defeated the Caledonians at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mons_Graupius" title="Battle of Mons Graupius">Battle of Mons Graupius</a>. Tacitus wrote that, before the battle, the Caledonian leader, <a href="/wiki/Calgacus" title="Calgacus">Calgacus</a>, gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the "last of the free" and accused the Romans of "making the world a desert and calling it peace" (freely translated). After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the <a href="/wiki/Gask_Ridge" title="Gask Ridge">Gask Ridge</a> close to the <a href="/wiki/Highland_Boundary_Fault" title="Highland Boundary Fault">Highland line</a> (only <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cawdor_(Roman_Fort)" title="Cawdor (Roman Fort)">Cawdor</a> near <a href="/wiki/Inverness" title="Inverness">Inverness</a> is known to have been constructed beyond that line). Three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Uplands" title="Southern Uplands">Southern Uplands</a>.</p>
<p>The Romans erected <a href="/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall" title="Hadrian's Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a> to control tribes on both sides of the wall so the <i><a href="/wiki/Limes_Britannicus" title="Limes Britannicus">Limes Britannicus</a></i> became the northern border of the Roman Empire; although the army held the <a href="/wiki/Antonine_Wall" title="Antonine Wall">Antonine Wall</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Central_Lowlands" title="Central Lowlands">Central Lowlands</a> for two short periods – the last during the reign of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Septimius_Severus" title="Septimius Severus">Septimius Severus</a> from 208 until 210.</p>
<p>The Roman military occupation of a significant part of what is now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years; although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brython" title="Brython">Brythonic</a> tribes such as the <a href="/wiki/Votadini" title="Votadini">Votadini</a> and <a href="/wiki/Damnonii" title="Damnonii">Damnonii</a>, would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries. The <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> term <a href="/wiki/Hen_Ogledd" title="Hen Ogledd">Hen Ogledd</a> ("Old North") is used by scholars to describe what is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by <a href="/wiki/Common_Brittonic" title="Common Brittonic">Brittonic</a>-speaking people around AD 500 to 800. According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the <a href="/wiki/Gaels" title="Gaels">Gaelic</a> kingdom of <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata" title="Dál Riata">Dál Riata</a> was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland. The 'traditional' view is that settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them. However, recently some archaeologists have argued against this view, saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.</p>

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Picts" title="Kingdom of the Picts">Kingdom of the Picts</a> (based in <a href="/wiki/Fortriu" title="Fortriu">Fortriu</a> by the 6th century) was the state that eventually became known as "Alba" or "Scotland". The development of "Pictland", according to the historical model developed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Heather" title="Peter Heather">Peter Heather</a>, was a natural response to Roman imperialism. Another view places emphasis on the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dun_Nechtain" title="Battle of Dun Nechtain">Battle of Dun Nechtain</a>, and the reign of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bridei_III_of_the_Picts" title="Bridei III of the Picts">Bridei m. Beli</a> (671–693), with another period of consolidation in the reign of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%C3%93engus_I_of_the_Picts" title="Óengus I of the Picts">Óengus mac Fergusa</a> (732–761).</p>
<p>The Kingdom of the Picts as it was in the early 8th century, when <a href="/wiki/Bede" title="Bede">Bede</a> was writing, was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Scotland" title="Alexander I of Scotland">Alexander I</a> (1107–1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland" title="Kenneth I of Scotland">Cináed mac Ailpín</a> (Kenneth MacAlpin).</p>
<p>From a base of territory in eastern Scotland north of the <a href="/wiki/River_Forth" title="River Forth">River Forth</a> and south of the <a href="/wiki/River_Oykel" title="River Oykel">River Oykel</a>, the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">English</a>-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic" title="Scottish Gaelic">Gaelic</a>-speaking <a href="/wiki/Galloway" title="Galloway">Galloway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_Norse" title="Old Norse">Norse</a>-speaking <a href="/wiki/Caithness" title="Caithness">Caithness</a>; by the end of the 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The push for this change was the reign of <a href="/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland" title="David I of Scotland">David I</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Davidian_Revolution" title="Davidian Revolution">Davidian Revolution</a>. Feudalism, government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns (called <a href="/wiki/Burgh" title="Burgh">burghs</a>) began in this period. These institutions and the immigration of French and Anglo-French knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis, whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom's original territory in the east became, like the newly acquired south-east, English-speaking, while the rest of the country retained the Gaelic language, apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, which remained under Norse rule until 1468. The Scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was relative peace with England, trade and educational links were well developed with the Continent and at the height of this cultural flowering <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Duns_Scotus" title="John Duns Scotus">John Duns Scotus</a> was one of Europe's most important and influential philosophers.</p>

<p>The death of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland" title="Alexander III of Scotland">Alexander III</a> in March 1286, followed by that of his granddaughter <a href="/wiki/Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway" title="Margaret, Maid of Norway">Margaret, Maid of Norway</a>, broke the centuries-old succession line of Scotland's kings and shattered the 200-year golden age that began with David I. <a href="/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" title="Edward I of England">Edward I of England</a> was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the Scottish crown, and he organised a process known as the <a href="/wiki/Competitors_for_the_Crown_of_Scotland" title="Competitors for the Crown of Scotland">Great Cause</a> to identify the most legitimate claimant. <a href="/wiki/John_Balliol" title="John Balliol">John Balliol</a> was pronounced king in the Great Hall of <a href="/wiki/Berwick_Castle" title="Berwick Castle">Berwick Castle</a> on 17 November 1292 and inaugurated at <a href="/wiki/Scone,_Perth_and_Kinross" title="Scone, Perth and Kinross">Scone</a> on 30 November, <a href="/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Day" title="St. Andrew's Day">St. Andrew's Day</a>. Edward I, who had coerced recognition as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lord_Paramount_of_Scotland" title="Lord Paramount of Scotland">Lord Paramount of Scotland</a>, the feudal superior of the realm, steadily undermined John's authority. In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Instead the Scottish parliament sent envoys to France to negotiate an alliance. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the <a href="/wiki/Auld_Alliance" title="Auld Alliance">Auld Alliance</a> (1295–1560). War ensued and King John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Moray" title="Andrew Moray">Andrew Moray</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Wallace" title="William Wallace">William Wallace</a> initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence" title="Wars of Scottish Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> (1296–1328).</p>
<p>The nature of the struggle changed significantly when <a href="/wiki/Robert_the_Bruce" title="Robert the Bruce">Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick</a>, killed his rival <a href="/wiki/John_III_Comyn,_Lord_of_Badenoch" title="John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch">John Comyn</a> on 10 February 1306 at <a href="/wiki/Greyfriars_Kirk" title="Greyfriars Kirk">Greyfriars Kirk</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dumfries" title="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>. He was crowned king (as Robert I) less than seven weeks later. Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders piece by piece. Victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bannockburn" title="Battle of Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a> in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1315, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Bruce" title="Edward Bruce">Edward Bruce</a>, brother of the King, was briefly appointed <a href="/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland" title="High King of Ireland">High King of Ireland</a> during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland's position in its wars against England.

<p>However, war with England continued for several decades after the death of Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, <a href="/wiki/David_II_of_Scotland" title="David II of Scotland">David II's</a> lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew <a href="/wiki/Robert_II_of_Scotland" title="Robert II of Scotland">Robert II</a> to come to the throne and establish the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stewart_Dynasty" title="Stewart Dynasty">Stewart Dynasty</a>. The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Reformation" title="Scottish Reformation">Reformation</a>. This was despite continual warfare with England, the increasing division between <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands" title="Scottish Lowlands">Lowlands</a>, and a large number of royal minorities.</p>

<p>In 1603, <a href="/wiki/James_VI_and_I" title="James VI and I">James VI, King of Scots</a> inherited the thrones of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" title="Kingdom of England">Kingdom of England</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland" title="Kingdom of Ireland">Kingdom of Ireland</a>, and became King James I of England and Ireland, and left <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> for London. With the exception of a short period under <a href="/wiki/The_Protectorate" title="The Protectorate">the Protectorate</a>, Scotland remained a separate state, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Covenanters" title="Covenanters">Covenanters</a> over the form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presbyterian_church_governance" title="Presbyterian church governance">church government</a>.

As late as the 1690s, Scotland experienced famine, which reduced the population of parts of the country by at least 20 per cent.</p>
<p>In 1698, the Scots attempted an ambitious project to secure a trading colony on the <a href="/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama" title="Isthmus of Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the <a href="/wiki/Darien_scheme" title="Darien scheme">Darien scheme</a>. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.</p>

<p>With trade tariffs with England now abolished, trade blossomed, especially with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Colonial_America" title="Colonial America">Colonial America</a>. The clippers belonging to the <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> <a href="/wiki/Tobacco_Lords" title="Tobacco Lords">Tobacco Lords</a> were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Until the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_War_of_Independence" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a> in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade. The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands" title="Scottish Lowlands">Scottish Lowlands</a> and the ancient clans of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> grew, amplifying centuries of division.</p>
<p>The deposed <a href="/wiki/Jacobitism" title="Jacobitism">Jacobite Stuart</a> claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterians</a>, including Roman Catholics and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Episcopalian_Protestants" title="Episcopalian Protestants">Episcopalian Protestants</a>. However, two major <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jacobite_Rising" title="Jacobite Rising">Jacobite Risings</a> launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Hanover" title="House of Hanover">House of Hanover</a> from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden" title="Battle of Culloden">Battle of Culloden</a>, Great Britain's last <a href="/wiki/Pitched_battle" title="Pitched battle">pitched battle</a>.

Historian Neil Davidson notes "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland."

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Reform_Act_1832" title="Scottish Reform Act 1832">Scottish Reform Act 1832</a> increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland" title="Secretary of State for Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a> was revived. Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_E._Gladstone" title="William E. Gladstone">William E. Gladstone</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Primrose,_5th_Earl_of_Rosebery" title="Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery">the Earl of Rosebery</a>. In the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by <a href="/wiki/Keir_Hardie" title="Keir Hardie">Keir Hardie</a>'s success in the <a href="/wiki/Mid_Lanarkshire_by-election,_1888" title="Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888">Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888</a>, leading to the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Labour_Party_(1888)" title="Scottish Labour Party (1888)">Scottish Labour Party</a>, which was absorbed into the <a href="/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party" title="Independent Labour Party">Independent Labour Party</a> in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.</p>
<p>Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London. After 1860 the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists <a href="/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin" title="William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a>, and the engineers and inventors <a href="/wiki/James_Watt" title="James Watt">James Watt</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Murdoch" title="William Murdoch">William Murdoch</a>, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain. In literature the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was <a href="/wiki/Walter_Scott" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a>. His first prose work, <a href="/wiki/Waverley_(novel)" title="Waverley (novel)">Waverley</a> in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity. In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as <a href="/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" title="Arthur Conan Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._M._Barrie" title="J. M. Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_MacDonald" title="George MacDonald">George MacDonald</a>. Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The <a href="/wiki/Glasgow_School" title="Glasgow School">Glasgow School</a>, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the <a href="/wiki/Celtic_Revival" title="Celtic Revival">Celtic Revival</a> the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_Movement" title="Arts and Crafts Movement">Arts and Crafts Movement</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Japonisme" title="Japonisme">Japonisme</a>, which found favour throughout the <a href="/wiki/Modern_art" title="Modern art">modern art</a> world of continental Europe and helped define the <a href="/wiki/Art_Nouveau" title="Art Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style. Proponents included architect and artist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh" title="Charles Rennie Mackintosh">Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a>.</p>
<p>This period saw a process of rehabilitation for Highland culture. In the 1820s, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">Romantic revival</a>, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's <a href="/wiki/Ossian" title="Ossian">Ossian</a> cycle and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. However, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. The desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the <a href="/wiki/Highland_Clearances" title="Highland Clearances">Highland Clearances</a>, in which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under <a href="/wiki/Scots_law" title="Scots law">Scots law</a>, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.</p>

<p>After prolonged years of struggle in the Kirk, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the <a href="/wiki/General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland" title="General Assembly of the Church of Scotland">General Assembly</a> and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted "intrusive" presentations to livings by patrons. The following "Ten Years' Conflict" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Chalmers" title="Thomas Chalmers">Thomas Chalmers</a>, known as the Great <a href="/wiki/Disruption_of_1843" title="Disruption of 1843">Disruption of 1843</a>. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate <a href="/wiki/Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843%E2%80%931900)" title="Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)">Free Church of Scotland</a>. In the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the <a href="/wiki/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Scotland" title="Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland">Free Presbyterian Church</a> in 1893. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a> in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, mainly to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.</p>
<p>Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic <a href="/wiki/University_of_Glasgow" title="University of Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_University_of_St_Andrews" title="The University of St Andrews">The University of St Andrews</a> pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_20th_century">Early 20th century</span></h3>

<p>Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_World_War" title="First World War">First World War</a>. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Field_Marshal_(United_Kingdom)" title="Field Marshal (United Kingdom)">Field Marshal</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Douglas_Haig" title="Douglas Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a> was Britain's commander on the Western Front.</p>
<p>The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called "<a href="/wiki/Red_Clydeside" title="Red Clydeside">Red Clydeside</a>" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> stronghold, the industrial districts switched to <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> by 1922, with a base among the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Catholic" title="Irish Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.</p>
<p>The shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> brought renewed prosperity, despite extensive bombing of cities by the Luftwaffe.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Since_1945">Since 1945</span></h3>
<p>After 1945, Scotland's economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance. Economic factors contributing to this recovery include a resurgent financial services industry, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronics_manufacturing" title="Electronics manufacturing">electronics manufacturing</a>, (see <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Glen" title="Silicon Glen">Silicon Glen</a>), and the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea_oil" title="North Sea oil">North Sea oil</a> and gas industry. The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher's government of the <a href="/wiki/Community_Charge" title="Community Charge">Community Charge</a> (widely known as the Poll Tax) one year before the rest of the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs. Following a <a href="/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1997" title="Scottish devolution referendum, 1997">referendum on devolution proposals in 1997</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998" title="Scotland Act 1998">Scotland Act 1998</a> was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament to establish a devolved <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Government" title="Scottish Government">Scottish Government</a> with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Scotland" title="Education in Scotland">Scottish education system</a> has always remained distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom, with a characteristic emphasis on a <a href="/wiki/Liberal_education" title="Liberal education">broad education</a>. In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the <a href="/wiki/Education_Act_1496" title="Education Act 1496">Education Act 1496</a>, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn "perfyct Latyne", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite. In the Reformation the 1560 <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_Book_of_Discipline" title="First Book of Discipline">First Book of Discipline</a></i> set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible. In 1616 an <a href="/wiki/School_Establishment_Act_1616" title="School Establishment Act 1616">act in Privy council</a> commanded every parish to establish a school. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas. Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the <a href="/wiki/Elementary_Education_Act_1870" title="Elementary Education Act 1870">Education Act (1872)</a>.</p>

This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the <a href="/wiki/Cambrian" title="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Precambrian" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a>, which were uplifted during the later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caledonian_Orogeny" title="Caledonian Orogeny">Caledonian Orogeny</a>. It is interspersed with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Igneous" title="Igneous">igneous</a> intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the <a href="/wiki/Cairngorms" title="Cairngorms">Cairngorms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Skye" title="Skye">Skye</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cuillins" title="Cuillins">Cuillins</a>.</p>
<p>A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of <a href="/wiki/Old_Red_Sandstone" title="Old Red Sandstone">Old Red Sandstones</a> found principally along the <a href="/wiki/Moray_Firth" title="Moray Firth">Moray Firth</a> coast. The <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a> are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Hebrides" title="Inner Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including <a href="/wiki/Loch_Lomond" title="Loch Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> and <a href="/wiki/Loch_Ness" title="Loch Ness">Loch Ness</a>. Some parts of the coastline consist of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Machair_(geography)" title="Machair (geography)">machair</a>, a low lying dune pasture land.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Central_Lowlands" title="Central Lowlands">Central Lowlands</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Rift_valley" title="Rift valley">rift valley</a> mainly comprising <a href="/wiki/Paleozoic" title="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, <a href="/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat" title="Arthur's Seat">Arthur's Seat</a> in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the <a href="/wiki/Ochil_Hills" title="Ochil Hills">Ochils</a> and <a href="/wiki/Campsie_Fells" title="Campsie Fells">Campsie Fells</a> are rarely far from view.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Southern_Uplands" title="Southern Uplands">Southern Uplands</a> are a range of hills almost 200 kilometres (124 mi) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second <a href="/wiki/Fault_(geology)" title="Fault (geology)">fault line</a> (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from <a href="/wiki/Girvan" title="Girvan">Girvan</a> to <a href="/wiki/Dunbar" title="Dunbar">Dunbar</a>. The geological foundations largely comprise <a href="/wiki/Silurian" title="Silurian">Silurian</a> deposits laid down some 4–500 million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Merrick,_Galloway" title="Merrick, Galloway">Merrick</a> with an elevation of 843 m (2,766 ft). The Southern Uplands is home to the UK's highest village, <a href="/wiki/Wanlockhead" title="Wanlockhead">Wanlockhead</a> (430 m or 1,411 ft above sea level).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Climate_of_Scotland" title="Climate of Scotland">Climate of Scotland</a></div>
<p>The climate of Scotland is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate">temperate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_climate" title="Oceanic climate">oceanic</a>, and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" title="Gulf Stream">Gulf Stream</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a>, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as <a href="/wiki/Labrador" title="Labrador">Labrador</a>, southern <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, the Moscow region in Russia, and the <a href="/wiki/Kamchatka_Peninsula" title="Kamchatka Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a> on the opposite side of <a href="/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the coldest ever UK temperature of −27.2 °C (−17.0 °F) recorded at <a href="/wiki/Braemar" title="Braemar">Braemar</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grampian_Mountains_(Scotland)" title="Grampian Mountains (Scotland)">Grampian Mountains</a>, on 11 February 1895. Winter maxima average 6 °C (42.8 °F) in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging 18 °C (64.4 °F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.9 °C (91.2 °F) at <a href="/wiki/Greycrook" title="Greycrook">Greycrook</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Borders" title="Scottish Borders">Scottish Borders</a> on 9 August 2003.</p>
<p>The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ocean_currents" title="Ocean currents">ocean currents</a> and the colder surface temperatures of the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. <a href="/wiki/Tiree" title="Tiree">Tiree</a>, in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding 3,000 mm (118.1 in). In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800 mm (31.5 in) annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average of 59 snow days per year, while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per year.</p>

<p>Scotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as <a href="/wiki/Northern_gannet" title="Northern gannet">gannets</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Golden_eagle" title="Golden eagle">golden eagle</a> is something of a national icon.</p>
<p>On the high mountain tops, species including <a href="/wiki/Rock_ptarmigan" title="Rock ptarmigan">ptarmigan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mountain_hare" title="Mountain hare">mountain hare</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stoat" title="Stoat">stoat</a> can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native <a href="/wiki/Scots_pine" title="Scots pine">Scots pine</a> forest exist and within these areas the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_crossbill" title="Scottish crossbill">Scottish crossbill</a>, the UK's only <a href="/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> bird species and <a href="/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a>, can be found alongside <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capercaillie" title="Capercaillie">capercaillie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wildcat" title="Wildcat">wildcat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Red_squirrel" title="Red squirrel">red squirrel</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pine_marten" title="Pine marten">pine marten</a>. In recent years various animals have been re-introduced, including the <a href="/wiki/White-tailed_eagle" title="White-tailed eagle">white-tailed sea eagle</a> in 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Red_kite" title="Red kite">red kite</a> in the 1980s, and more recently there have been experimental projects involving the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_beaver" title="European beaver">beaver</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wild_boar" title="Wild boar">wild boar</a>. Today, much of the remaining native <a href="/wiki/Caledonian_Forest" title="Caledonian Forest">Caledonian Forest</a> lies within the <a href="/wiki/Cairngorms_National_Park" title="Cairngorms National Park">Cairngorms National Park</a> and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in <a href="/wiki/Argyll" title="Argyll">Argyll</a>, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.</p>
<p>The flora of the country is varied incorporating both <a href="/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coniferous" title="Coniferous">coniferous</a> woodland and <a href="/wiki/Moorland" title="Moorland">moorland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> species. However, large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)" title="Indigenous (ecology)">indigenous</a> plants and animals. The UK's tallest tree is a <a href="/wiki/Abies_grandis" title="Abies grandis">grand fir</a> planted beside <a href="/wiki/Loch_Fyne" title="Loch Fyne">Loch Fyne</a>, Argyll in the 1870s, and the <a href="/wiki/Fortingall_Yew" title="Fortingall Yew">Fortingall Yew</a> may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe. Although the number of native <a href="/wiki/Vascular_plant" title="Vascular plant">vascular plants</a> is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial <a href="/wiki/Bryophyte" title="Bryophyte">bryophyte</a> flora is of global importance.</p>

<p>The population of Scotland at the 2001 Census was 5,062,011. This rose to 5,295,400, the highest ever, at the 2011 Census.</p>
<p>In the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's population stated their <a href="/wiki/National_identity" title="National identity">national identity</a> as '<a href="/wiki/Scottish_people" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a> only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose other national identities.</p>
<p>Although Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The <a href="/wiki/Greater_Glasgow" title="Greater Glasgow">Greater Glasgow</a> conurbation, with a population of almost 1.2 million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population. The <a href="/wiki/Central_Belt" title="Central Belt">Central Belt</a> is where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen.</p>
<p>In general, only the more accessible and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature and dominated by agriculture and forestry. Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh, five <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_town#United_Kingdom" title="New town">new towns</a> were created between 1947 and 1966. They are <a href="/wiki/East_Kilbride" title="East Kilbride">East Kilbride</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glenrothes" title="Glenrothes">Glenrothes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Livingston,_West_Lothian" title="Livingston, West Lothian">Livingston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cumbernauld" title="Cumbernauld">Cumbernauld</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Irvine,_North_Ayrshire" title="Irvine, North Ayrshire">Irvine</a>.</p>
<p>Immigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee small South Asian communities. In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group. Since the <a href="/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="Enlargement of the European Union">Enlargement of the European Union</a> more people from <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">Central</a> and Eastern Europe have moved to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000 <a href="/wiki/Poles" title="Poles">Poles</a> live there.</p>

<p>Scotland has three officially recognised languages: English, <a href="/wiki/Scots_language" title="Scots language">Scots</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic" title="Scottish Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>. Scottish Standard English, a variety of English as spoken in Scotland, is at one end of a bipolar <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Linguistic_continuum" title="Linguistic continuum">linguistic continuum</a>, with broad <a href="/wiki/Scots_language" title="Scots language">Scots</a> at the other. Scottish Standard English may have been influenced to varying degrees by Scots. The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had "no skills in Scots". Others speak <a href="/wiki/Highland_English" title="Highland English">Highland English</a>. Gaelic is mostly spoken in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Western_Isles" title="Western Isles">Western Isles</a>, where a large proportion of people still speak it; however, nationally its use is confined to just 1% of the population. The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008.</p>
<p>There are many more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total population of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2 million Americans self-reported some degree of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_American" title="Scottish American">Scottish</a> descent. <a href="/wiki/Ulster" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>'s Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent, and it is estimated that there are more than 27 million descendants of the <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people" title="Ulster Scots people">Scots-Irish</a> migration now living in the US. In Canada, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish-Canadian" title="Scottish-Canadian">Scottish-Canadian</a> community accounts for 4.7 million people. About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.</p>
<p>In August 2012, the Scottish population reached an all-time high of 5.25 million people. The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Total_fertility_rate" title="Total fertility rate">total fertility rate</a> (TFR) in Scotland is below the replacement rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011). The majority of births today are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012).</p>

<p>Life expectancy for those born in Scotland between 2010 and 2012 is 76.5 years for males and 80.7 years for females. This is the lowest of any of the four countries of the UK.</p>

Since 1689 it has had a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> system of church government, and enjoys independence from the state. Its membership is 398,389, about 7.5% of the total population, though according to the 2014 Scottish Annual Household Survey, 27.8%, or 1.5 million adherents, identified Church of Scotland as their religion. The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with every community in Scotland having a local congregation.</p>
<p>Scotland also has a significant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church_in_Scotland" title="Roman Catholic Church in Scotland">Roman Catholic</a> population, 19% claiming that faith, particularly in the west. After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like <a href="/wiki/Uist" title="Uist">Uist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barra" title="Barra">Barra</a>, and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland. Other Christian denominations in Scotland include the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_Church_of_Scotland_(post_1900)" title="Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)">Free Church of Scotland</a>, and various other Presbyterian offshoots. "Scotland's third largest church" is the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>.</p>
<p>Islam is the largest non-Christian religion (estimated at around 75,000, which is about 1.4% of the population), and there are also significant <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Scotland" title="History of the Jews in Scotland">Jewish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hinduism_in_Scotland" title="Hinduism in Scotland">Hindu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sikh" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> communities, especially in Glasgow.

<p>Scotland's head of state is the monarch of the United Kingdom, currently <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II" title="Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> (since 1952). The <a href="/wiki/Regnal_number" title="Regnal number">regnal numbering</a> "Elizabeth II" caused <a href="/wiki/List_of_titles_and_honours_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II#Scottish_controversy" title="List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II">controversy</a> around the time of the Queen's coronation because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland. A legal action, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MacCormick_v._Lord_Advocate" title="MacCormick v. Lord Advocate">MacCormick v. Lord Advocate</a> (1953 SC 396), was brought to contest the right of the Queen to entitle herself <i>Elizabeth II</i> within Scotland, arguing that this was a breach of Article 1 of the Treaty of Union. <a href="/wiki/The_Crown" title="The Crown">The Crown</a> won the case. It was decided that future British monarchs would be numbered according to either their English or their Scottish predecessors, whichever number is higher. For instance any future King James would be styled James VIII—since the last Scottish King James was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_VII_of_Scotland" title="James VII of Scotland">James VII</a> (also James II of England, etc.)—while the next King Henry would be King Henry IX throughout the UK even though there have been no Scottish kings of that name.</p>
<p>Scotland has limited <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self-government" title="Self-government">self-government</a> within the United Kingdom, as well as representation in the UK Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at <a href="/wiki/Holyrood,_Edinburgh" title="Holyrood, Edinburgh">Holyrood</a> in Edinburgh since 1999.

The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland, as well as a limited power to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tartan_Tax" title="Tartan Tax">vary income tax</a>.</p>
<p>The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to the UK Parliament by passing a <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Consent_Motion" title="Legislative Consent Motion">Legislative Consent Motion</a> if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the UK. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.</p>

<p>The Scottish Parliament is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unicameral" title="Unicameral">unicameral</a> legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_past_the_post" title="First past the post">first past the post</a> system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Additional_member_system_(Scottish_Parliament)" title="Additional member system (Scottish Parliament)">additional member system</a>.

<p>A policy of <a href="/wiki/Devolution" title="Devolution">devolution</a> had been advocated by the three main UK parties with varying enthusiasm during recent history. The late Labour leader <a href="/wiki/John_Smith_(Labour_Party_leader)" title="John Smith (Labour Party leader)">John Smith</a> described the revival of a Scottish parliament as the "settled will of the Scottish people". The devolved Scottish Parliament was created after a <a href="/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1997" title="Scottish devolution referendum, 1997">referendum in 1997</a> found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to <a href="/wiki/Scottish_variable_rate" title="Scottish variable rate">vary income tax</a>. The constitutional status of Scotland is nonetheless subject to ongoing debate.</p>
<p>The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence" title="Scottish independence">Scottish independence</a>, was first elected to form the Scottish Government in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2007" title="Scottish Parliament general election, 2007">2007</a>. The new government established a "<a href="/wiki/National_Conversation" title="National Conversation">National Conversation</a>" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">federalism</a>, or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. In rejecting the last option, the three main opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament created a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calman_Commission" title="Calman Commission">commission</a> to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies. The <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_2012" title="Scotland Act 2012">Scotland Act 2012</a>, based on proposals by the commission, was subsequently enacted devolving additional powers to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<p>In August 2009 the SNP proposed a bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat. After the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2011" title="Scottish Parliament election, 2011">2011 elections</a> gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, a <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014" title="Scottish independence referendum, 2014">referendum on independence for Scotland</a> was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum rejected independence by a majority of 55% to 45%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the UK Parliament pledged to extend the powers of the Scottish Parliament. An all-party <a href="/wiki/Smith_Commission" title="Smith Commission">commission</a> chaired by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lord_Smith_of_Kelvin" title="Lord Smith of Kelvin">Lord Smith of Kelvin</a> was formed, which led to a further devolution of powers through the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_2016" title="Scotland Act 2016">Scotland Act 2016</a>.</p>
<p>Following the referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union on 23 June 2016, where a UK-wide majority voted to withdraw from the EU whilst a majority within Scotland voted to remain, Scotland's <a href="/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland" title="First Minister of Scotland">First Minister</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon" title="Nicola Sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, announced that as a result a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Scottish_independence_referendum" title="Second Scottish independence referendum">new independence referendum</a> was "highly likely".</p>

Some of these names are still sometimes used as geographical descriptors.</p>
<p>Modern Scotland is subdivided in various ways depending on the purpose. In local government, there have been 32 single-tier council areas since 1996, whose councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Community councils are informal organisations that represent specific sub-divisions of a council area.</p>
<p>In the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there are 59 constituencies. Until 2013, the Scottish fire brigades and police forces were based on a system of regions introduced in 1975. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Scots_law" title="Scots law">Scots law</a></div>

<p>Scots law has a basis derived from <a href="/wiki/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman law</a>, combining features of both uncodified <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a>, dating back to the <i><a href="/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="Corpus Juris Civilis">Corpus Juris Civilis</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> with <a href="/wiki/Legal_institutions_of_Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages" title="Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages">medieval sources</a>. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales. Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably <a href="/wiki/Udal_law" title="Udal law">Udal law</a> in <a href="/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shetland" title="Shetland">Shetland</a>, based on old Norse law.

<p>Scots law provides for three types of <a href="/wiki/Courts_of_Scotland" title="Courts of Scotland">courts</a> responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_Arms" title="Law of Arms">heraldic</a>.

<p>For many decades the Scots legal system was unique for being the only legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament, which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: "guilty", "not guilty" and "<i><a href="/wiki/Not_proven" title="Not proven">not proven</a></i>". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an <a href="/wiki/Acquittal" title="Acquittal">acquittal</a>, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of <a href="/wiki/Double_jeopardy" title="Double jeopardy">double jeopardy</a>. There is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to <a href="/wiki/Perverting_the_course_of_justice" title="Perverting the course of justice">pervert the course of justice</a> – see the provisions of the <a href="/wiki/Double_jeopardy#Scotland" title="Double jeopardy">Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011</a>. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. <a href="/wiki/Manslaughter" title="Manslaughter">Manslaughter</a>, in England and Wales, is broadly similar to <a href="/wiki/Culpable_homicide" title="Culpable homicide">culpable homicide</a> in Scotland, and arson is called <a href="/wiki/Wilful_fire_raising" title="Wilful fire raising">wilful fire raising</a>. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen, rather than twelve jurors, as is more common in English-speaking countries.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Prison_Service" title="Scottish Prison Service">Scottish Prison Service</a> (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland, which collectively house over 8,500 prisoners.

<p>Healthcare in Scotland is mainly provided by <a href="/wiki/NHS_Scotland" title="NHS Scotland">NHS Scotland</a>, Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service_(Scotland)_Act_1947" title="National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947">National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947</a> (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales.

<p>In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances. These fees and allowances were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about £30,000 per annum.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland" title="Economy of Scotland">Economy of Scotland</a></div>

<p>Scotland has a Western-style <a href="/wiki/Open_economy" title="Open economy">open</a> <a href="/wiki/Mixed_economy" title="Mixed economy">mixed economy</a> closely linked with the rest of Europe and the wider world. Traditionally, the Scottish economy has been dominated by <a href="/wiki/Heavy_industry" title="Heavy industry">heavy industry</a> underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Steel_making" title="Steel making">steel industries</a>. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of <a href="/wiki/North_Sea_oil" title="North Sea oil">North Sea oil</a> have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland.</p>
<p>In February 2012, the Centre for Economics and Business Research concluded that "Scotland receives no net subsidy" from the UK, as greater per capita tax generation in Scotland balanced out greater per capita public spending. More recent data, from 2012–13, show that Scotland generated 9.1% (£53.1bn; this included a geographical share of North Sea oil revenue – without it, the figures were 8.2% and £47.6bn) of the UK's tax revenues and received 9.3% (£65.2bn) of spending. Scotland's public spending deficit in 2012–13 was £12bn, a £3.5bn increase on the previous year; over the same period, the UK's deficit decreased by £2.6bn. Over the past thirty years, Scotland contributed a relative budget surplus of almost £20billion to the UK economy.</p>
<p>In the third quarter of 2015, the Scottish economy grew by 0.1%, below the 0.4% recorded for the UK. As of September 2015, the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UK rate of 5.5%, while the Scottish employment rate of 74.0% was higher than the UK figure of 73.5%. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_economic_activity" title="Tertiary sector of economic activity">service</a>-oriented economy.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with many large finance firms based there, including: <a href="/wiki/Lloyds_Banking_Group" title="Lloyds Banking Group">Lloyds Banking Group</a> (owners of <a href="/wiki/HBOS" title="HBOS">HBOS</a>); the Government owned <a href="/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland" title="Royal Bank of Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Standard_Life" title="Standard Life">Standard Life</a>. Edinburgh was ranked 15th in the <a href="/wiki/Global_Financial_Centres_Index" title="Global Financial Centres Index">list of world financial centres</a> in 2007, but fell to 37th in 2012, following damage to its reputation, and in 2016 was ranked 56th out of 86.</p>
<p>In 2012, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were estimated to be £26 billion, of which 59% (£15.4 billion) were attributable to manufacturing. Scotland's primary exports include <a href="/wiki/Whisky" title="Whisky">whisky</a>, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and gas reserves if they were split geographically using a median line from the English-Scottish border. If the reserves were split by population, that figure would be reduced to 9%.</p>
<p>Whisky is one of Scotland's more known goods of economic activity. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012 and were valued at £4.3 billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports. It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly. It may contribute £400–682 million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.</p>
<p>A briefing published in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) for the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Life Long Learning Committee stated that tourism accounted for up to 5% of GDP and 7.5% of employment.</p>

<p>Scotland has a literary heritage dating back to the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brythonic_languages" title="Brythonic languages">Brythonic</a> speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of <a href="/wiki/Welsh-language_literature" title="Welsh-language literature">Welsh literature</a>. Later medieval literature included works in Latin, Gaelic, Old English and French. The first surviving major text in <a href="/wiki/Early_Scots" title="Early Scots">Early Scots</a> is the 14th-century poet <a href="/wiki/John_Barbour_(poet)" title="John Barbour (poet)">John Barbour</a>'s epic <i><a href="/wiki/The_Brus" title="The Brus">Brus</a></i>, focusing on the life of Robert I, and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works. In the 16th century the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry, but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as a literary language. Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including <a href="/wiki/James_Macpherson" title="James Macpherson">James Macpherson</a>, whose <a href="/wiki/Ossian" title="Ossian">Ossian Cycle</a> made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment. It was also a major influence on <a href="/wiki/Robert_Burns" title="Robert Burns">Robert Burns</a>, whom many consider the national poet, and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Scott" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a>, whose <a href="/wiki/Waverley_Novels" title="Waverley Novels">Waverley Novels</a> did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century. Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including <a href="/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" title="Arthur Conan Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._M._Barrie" title="J. M. Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_MacDonald" title="George MacDonald">George MacDonald</a>. In the 20th century the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Renaissance" title="Scottish Renaissance">Scottish Renaissance</a> saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature. Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Morgan_(poet)" title="Edwin Morgan (poet)">Edwin Morgan</a>, who would be appointed the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scots_Makar" title="Scots Makar">Scots Makar</a> by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including <a href="/wiki/Irvine_Welsh" title="Irvine Welsh">Irvine Welsh</a>. Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included <a href="/wiki/Carol_Ann_Duffy" title="Carol Ann Duffy">Carol Ann Duffy</a>, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named UK <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Poet_Laureate" title="Poet Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>.</p>
