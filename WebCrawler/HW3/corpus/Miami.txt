<p>The Miami area was inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous cultures. The <a href="/wiki/Tequesta" title="Tequesta">Tequestas</a> occupied the area for a thousand years before encountering Europeans. An Indian village of hundreds of people dating to 500–600 B.C. was located at the mouth of the Miami River.</p>
<p>In 1566 the explorer, <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Men%C3%A9ndez_de_Avil%C3%A9s" title="Pedro Menéndez de Avilés">Pedro Menéndez de Avilés</a>, claimed it for <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Spain</a>. A Spanish <a href="/wiki/Mission_(station)" title="Mission (station)">mission</a> was constructed one year later in 1567. Spain and Great Britain successively "controlled" Florida, and Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the US built <a href="/wiki/Fort_Dallas" title="Fort Dallas">Fort Dallas</a> as part of its development of the Florida Territory and attempt to suppress and remove the <a href="/wiki/Seminole" title="Seminole">Seminole</a>. The Miami area subsequently became a site of fighting during the <a href="/wiki/Seminole_Wars#Second_Seminole_War" title="Seminole Wars">Second Seminole War</a>.</p>
<p>Miami is noted as "the only major city in the United States conceived by a woman, <a href="/wiki/Julia_Tuttle" title="Julia Tuttle">Julia Tuttle</a>", a local citrus grower and a wealthy <a href="/wiki/Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> native. The Miami area was better known as "Biscayne Bay Country" in the early years of its growth. In the late 19th century, reports described the area as a promising wilderness. The area was also characterized as "one of the finest building sites in Florida." The <a href="/wiki/Great_Freeze" title="Great Freeze">Great Freeze</a> of 1894–95 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced <a href="/wiki/Henry_Flagler" title="Henry Flagler">Henry Flagler</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Railroad_tycoon" title="Railroad tycoon">railroad tycoon</a>, to expand his <a href="/wiki/Florida_East_Coast_Railway" title="Florida East Coast Railway">Florida East Coast Railway</a> to the region, for which she became known as "the mother of Miami." Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300. It was named for the nearby <a href="/wiki/Miami_River_(Florida)" title="Miami River (Florida)">Miami River</a>, derived from <a href="/wiki/Mayaimi" title="Mayaimi">Mayaimi</a>, the historic name of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Okeechobee" title="Lake Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>.</p>

<p>Black labor played a crucial role in Miami's early development. During the beginning of the 20th century, migrants from the <a href="/wiki/The_Bahamas" title="The Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population. Whatever their role in the city's growth, their community's growth was limited to a small space. When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans in neighborhoods close to Avenue J (what would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang of white men with torches visited the renting families and warned them to move or be bombed.</p>
<p>During the early 20th century, northerners were attracted to the city, and Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure. The legacy of <a href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" title="Jim Crow laws">Jim Crow</a> was embedded in these developments. Miami's chief of police, H. Leslie Quigg, did not hide the fact that he, like many other white Miami police officers, was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Unsurprisingly, these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law. Quigg, for example, "personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman."</p>
<p>The collapse of the <a href="/wiki/Florida_land_boom_of_the_1920s" title="Florida land boom of the 1920s">Florida land boom of the 1920s</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1926_Miami_Hurricane" title="1926 Miami Hurricane">1926 Miami Hurricane</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s slowed development. When World War II began, Miami, well-situated on the southern coast of Florida, became a base for US defense against <a href="/wiki/U-boat" title="U-boat">German submarines</a>. The war brought an increase in Miami's population; by 1940, 172,172 people lived in the city.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> rose to power in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> in 1959, many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the population. The city developed businesses and cultural amenities as part of the <a href="/wiki/New_South" title="New South">New South</a>. In the 1980s and 1990s, South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars, immigration from Haiti and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew" title="Hurricane Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a>. Racial and cultural tensions were sometimes sparked, but the city developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international, financial, and cultural center. It is the second-largest US city (after <a href="/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>) with a Spanish-speaking majority, and the largest city with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cuban-American" title="Cuban-American">Cuban-American</a> plurality.</p>
<p>Miami and its metropolitan area grew from just over 1,000 residents to nearly 5.5 million residents in just 110 years (1896–2006). The city's nickname, <i>The Magic City</i>, comes from this rapid growth. Winter visitors remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>

<p>Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Florida_Everglades" title="Florida Everglades">Florida Everglades</a> to the west and <a href="/wiki/Biscayne_Bay" title="Biscayne Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> to the east, which also extends from <a href="/wiki/Florida_Bay" title="Florida Bay">Florida Bay</a> north to <a href="/wiki/Lake_Okeechobee" title="Lake Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>. The elevation of the area never rises above 40 ft (12 m) and averages at around 6 ft (1.8 m) above mean sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest undulations are found along the coastal <a href="/wiki/Miami_Rock_Ridge" title="Miami Rock Ridge">Miami Rock Ridge</a>, whose substrate underlies most of the eastern Miami metropolitan region. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created <a href="/wiki/Barrier_island" title="Barrier island">barrier islands</a>, the largest of which contains <a href="/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida" title="Miami Beach, Florida">Miami Beach</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Beach" title="South Beach">South Beach</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" title="Gulf Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, a warm <a href="/wiki/Ocean_current" title="Ocean current">ocean current</a>, runs northward just 15 miles (24 km) off the coast, allowing the city's climate to stay warm and mild all year.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Geology">Geology</span></h3>

<p>The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called <i>Miami <a href="/wiki/Oolite" title="Oolite">oolite</a></i> or <i>Miami <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a></i>. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glaciation" title="Glaciation">glaciations</a> or <i><a href="/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice ages</a></i>. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eemian_Stage" title="Eemian Stage">Sangamonian Stage</a> raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8 m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida <a href="/wiki/Plateau" title="Plateau">plateau</a>, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the <a href="/wiki/Dry_Tortugas" title="Dry Tortugas">Dry Tortugas</a>. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bryozoans" title="Bryozoans">bryozoans</a>. Starting about 100,000 years ago the <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin_glaciation" title="Wisconsin glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a> began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110 m) below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the <a href="/wiki/Mainland" title="Mainland">mainland</a> of South Florida just <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">above sea level</a>.</p>
<p>Beneath the plain lies the <a href="/wiki/Biscayne_Aquifer" title="Biscayne Aquifer">Biscayne Aquifer</a>, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern <a href="/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida" title="Palm Beach County, Florida">Palm Beach County</a> to <a href="/wiki/Florida_Bay" title="Florida Bay">Florida Bay</a>, with its highest point peaking around the cities of <a href="/wiki/Miami_Springs,_Florida" title="Miami Springs, Florida">Miami Springs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hialeah,_Florida" title="Hialeah, Florida">Hialeah</a>. Most of the <a href="/wiki/Miami_metropolitan_area" title="Miami metropolitan area">Miami metropolitan area</a> obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though <a href="/wiki/Transportation_in_South_Florida#Underground_parking" title="Transportation in South Florida">some underground parking garages</a> exist. For this reason, the <a href="/wiki/Rapid_transit" title="Rapid transit">mass transit</a> systems in and around Miami are elevated or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Land_grading" title="Land grading">at-grade</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the western fringes of the city extend into the <a href="/wiki/Everglades" title="Everglades">Everglades</a>, a subtropical marshland located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Alligator" title="American Alligator">Alligators</a> have ventured into Miami communities and on major highways.</p>
<p>In terms of land area, Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States. According to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" title="United States Census Bureau">US Census Bureau</a>, the city encompasses a total area of 55.27 sq mi (143.1 km). Of that area, 35.67 sq mi (92.4 km) is land and 19.59 sq mi (50.7 km) is water. That means Miami comprises over 400,000 people in 35 square miles (91 km), making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, along with New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In 1960, non-Hispanic whites represented 80% of <a href="/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" title="Miami-Dade County, Florida">Miami-Dade</a> county's population. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Miami's population as 45.3% Hispanic, 32.9% non-Hispanic White, and 22.7% Black.

Today, immigration to Miami has slowed significantly and Miami's growth today is attributed greatly to its fast urbanization and high-rise construction, which has increased its inner city neighborhood population densities, such as in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Downtown_Miami" title="Downtown Miami">Downtown</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brickell" title="Brickell">Brickell</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Edgewater_(Miami)" title="Edgewater (Miami)">Edgewater</a>, where one area in Downtown alone saw a 2,069% increase in population in the 2010 Census.

<p>Miami's road system is based along the numerical "Miami Grid" where <a href="/wiki/Flagler_Street" title="Flagler Street">Flagler Street</a> forms the east-west <a href="/wiki/Baseline_(surveying)" title="Baseline (surveying)">baseline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miami_Avenue" title="Miami Avenue">Miami Avenue</a> forms the north-south <a href="/wiki/Meridian_(geography)" title="Meridian (geography)">meridian</a>. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Downtown_Miami" title="Downtown Miami">Downtown</a> in front of the Downtown <a href="/wiki/Macy%27s" title="Macy's">Macy's</a> (formerly the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Burdine%27s" title="Burdine's">Burdine's</a> headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Downtown_Miami" title="Downtown Miami">Downtown</a>, which is close to the coast, therefore, the "NW" and "SW" quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Tamiami_Trail" title="Tamiami Trail">Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St</a>), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, within this grid north/south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east/west roads are Streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways. Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 blocks to each mile on north/south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east/west streets. Major north/south avenues generally end in "7" - e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue. (One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead.) Major east/west streets to the south of downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half mile south of Flagler ("zeroth") Street. Thus, major streets are at 8th St. + 16 = 24th St./Coral Way, + 16 = 40th St./Bird, +16 = 56th/Miller, + 16 = 72nd/ Sunset, + 16 = 88th/N. Kendall, + 16 = 104th (originally S. Kendall), + 16 = 120th/Montgomery, + 16 = 136th/Howard, + 16 = 152nd/Coral Reef, + 16 = 168th/Richmond, + 16 = 184th/Eureka, + 16 = 200th/Quail Roost, + 16 = 216th/Hainlin Mill, + 16 = 232nd/Silver Palm, + 16 = 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300's. Within the Grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side. This makes even unfamiliar addresses and distances easy - If one must travel from, say 1709 SW 8th St. to 24832 SW 157th Avenue, one knows it will be 140 blocks (157-17) / 20 miles to the west and 240 blocks (248-8) / 15 miles to the south, and that the destination will be on the south side of 248th St. Remarkably, even Miami natives are often unaware of this pattern.</p>
<p>All streets and avenues in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami-Dade_County" title="Miami-Dade County">Miami-Dade County</a> follow the Miami Grid, with a few exceptions, most notably <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coral_Gables" title="Coral Gables">Coral Gables</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hialeah" title="Hialeah">Hialeah</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coconut_Grove" title="Coconut Grove">Coconut Grove</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a>. One neighborhood, <a href="/wiki/The_Roads" title="The Roads">The Roads</a>, is thusly named because its streets run off the Miami Grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami-Dade_County" title="Miami-Dade County">Miami-Dade County</a> is served by four Interstate Highways (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interstate_75_(Florida)" title="Interstate 75 (Florida)">I-75</a>, <a href="/wiki/Interstate_95_in_Florida" title="Interstate 95 in Florida">I-95</a>, <a href="/wiki/Interstate_195_(Florida)" title="Interstate 195 (Florida)">I-195</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interstate_395_(Florida)" title="Interstate 395 (Florida)">I-395</a>) and several U.S. Highways including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Route_1_(Florida)" title="U.S. Route 1 (Florida)">U.S. Route 1</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Route_27_(Florida)" title="U.S. Route 27 (Florida)">U.S. Route 27</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Route_41_(Florida)" title="U.S. Route 41 (Florida)">U.S. Route 41</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Route_441_(Florida)" title="U.S. Route 441 (Florida)">U.S. Route 441</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, Miami was identified as having the rudest drivers in the United States, the second year in a row to have been cited, in a poll commissioned by automobile club AutoVantage. Miami is also consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States for pedestrians.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bicycling">Bicycling</span></h3>
<p>In recent years the city government, under Mayor <a href="/wiki/Manny_Diaz_(Florida_politician)" title="Manny Diaz (Florida politician)">Manny Diaz</a>, has taken an ambitious stance in support of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bicycling" title="Bicycling">bicycling</a> in Miami for both recreation and commuting. Every month, the city hosts "Bike Miami", where major streets in Downtown and Brickell are closed to automobiles, but left open for pedestrians and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bicyclist" title="Bicyclist">bicyclists</a>. The event began in November 2008, and has doubled in popularity from 1,500 participants to about 3,000 in the October 2009 Bike Miami. This is the longest-running such event in the US. In October 2009, the city also approved an extensive 20-year plan for bike routes and paths around the city. The city has begun construction of bike routes as of late 2009, and ordinances requiring bike parking in all future construction in the city became mandatory as of October 2009.</p>
<p>In 2010, Miami was ranked as the 44th-most bike-friendly city in the US according to <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bicycling_Magazine" title="Bicycling Magazine">Bicycling Magazine</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Walkability">Walkability</span></h3>
<p>A 2011 study by <a href="/wiki/Walk_Score" title="Walk Score">Walk Score</a> ranked Miami the eighth-most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States, but a 2013 survey by Travel + Leisure ranked Miami 34th for "public transportation and pedestrian friendliness."</p>
