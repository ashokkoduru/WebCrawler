<p>The name derives from the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sussex" title="Kingdom of Sussex">Kingdom of Sussex</a>, which was founded, according to legend, by <a href="/wiki/%C3%86lle_of_Sussex" title="Ælle of Sussex">Ælle of Sussex</a> in AD 477. In 825, it was absorbed into the kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Wessex" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> and subsequently into the kingdom of England.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Toponymy">Toponymy</span></h2>
<p>The name "Sussex" is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a> <i>Suth-sæxe</i>, which is in turn derived from the <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> <i>Suth-Seaxe</i> which means (land or people) of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/South_Saxons" title="South Saxons">South Saxons</a> (cf. <a href="/wiki/Essex#History" title="Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="/wiki/Middlesex#Toponomy" title="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wessex" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>). The South Saxons were a <a href="/wiki/Germanic_peoples" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic tribe</a> that settled in the region from the <a href="/wiki/North_German_Plain" title="North German Plain">North German Plain</a> during the 5th and 6th centuries.</p>
<p>The earliest known usage of the term South Saxons (Latin: <i>Australes Saxones</i>) is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king, <a href="/wiki/Nothhelm_of_Sussex" title="Nothhelm of Sussex">Noðhelm</a>, although the term may well have been in use for some time before that. The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong; recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/New_Latin" title="New Latin">New Latin</a> word <i>Suthsexia</i> was used for Sussex by Dutch cartographer <a href="/wiki/Joan_Blaeu" title="Joan Blaeu">Joan Blaeu</a> in his 1645 map.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Sussex" title="Flag of Sussex">flag of Sussex</a> consists of six gold <a href="/wiki/Martlet" title="Martlet">martlets</a>, or heraldic <a href="/wiki/Swallow" title="Swallow">swallows</a>, on a blue background, <a href="/wiki/Blazon" title="Blazon">blazoned</a> as <i>Azure, six <a href="/wiki/Martlet" title="Martlet">martlets</a> or</i>. Officially recognised by the <a href="/wiki/Flag_Institute" title="Flag Institute">Flag Institute</a> on 20 May 2011, its design is based on the <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Sussex" title="Coat of arms of Sussex">heraldic shield of Sussex</a> that first appeared in an atlas by <a href="/wiki/John_Speed" title="John Speed">John Speed</a> in 1622. The significance of the six martlets may be to represent the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as <i><a href="/wiki/Rape_(county_subdivision)" title="Rape (county subdivision)">rapes</a></i>. It may also be a <a href="/wiki/Canting_arms" title="Canting arms">canting</a> reference to the title of the historic leading Sussex family, the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Arundel" title="Earl of Arundel">Earls of Arundel</a>, seated at <a href="/wiki/Arundel_Castle" title="Arundel Castle">Arundel Castle</a> in the county, as the French for swallow is <i>hirondelle</i>.</p>

<p><i><a href="/wiki/Sussex_by_the_Sea" title="Sussex by the Sea">Sussex by the Sea</a></i> is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex; it was composed by <a href="/wiki/William_Ward-Higgs" title="William Ward-Higgs">William Ward-Higgs</a> in 1907, perhaps originally from the lyrics of <a href="/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s poem entitled <i>Sussex</i>. Adopted by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Sussex_Regiment" title="Royal Sussex Regiment">Royal Sussex Regiment</a> and popularised in <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, it is sung at celebrations across the county, including those at <a href="/wiki/Lewes_Bonfire" title="Lewes Bonfire">Lewes Bonfire</a>, and at sports matches, including those of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brighton_and_Hove_Albion_Football_Club" title="Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club">Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sussex_County_Cricket_Club" title="Sussex County Cricket Club">Sussex County Cricket Club</a>.</p>
<p>The county day, called <a href="/wiki/Sussex_Day" title="Sussex Day">Sussex Day</a>, is celebrated on 16 June, the same day as the feast day of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St_Richard_of_Chichester" title="St Richard of Chichester">St Richard of Chichester</a>, Sussex's <a href="/wiki/Patron_saint" title="Patron saint">patron saint</a>, whose shrine at <a href="/wiki/Chichester_Cathedral" title="Chichester Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a> was an important place of pilgrimage in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>
<p>Sussex's motto, <i><a href="/wiki/We_wunt_be_druv" title="We wunt be druv">We wunt be druv</a></i>, is a <a href="/wiki/Sussex_dialect" title="Sussex dialect">Sussex dialect</a> expression meaning 'we will not be pushed around' and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women.

<p>The physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weald%E2%80%93Artois_anticline" title="Weald–Artois anticline">Wealden anticline</a>, the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction: the <a href="/wiki/Weald" title="Weald">Weald</a> itself and the <a href="/wiki/South_Downs" title="South Downs">South Downs</a>. <a href="/wiki/Natural_England" title="Natural England">Natural England</a> has identified the following seven <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_character_area" title="National character area">national character areas</a> in Sussex:</p>

<p>At 280m, <a href="/wiki/Blackdown,_West_Sussex" title="Blackdown, West Sussex">Blackdown</a> is the highest point in Sussex, or <a href="/wiki/List_of_English_counties_by_highest_point" title="List of English counties by highest point">county top</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ditchling_Beacon" title="Ditchling Beacon">Ditchling Beacon</a> (248m) is the highest point in East Sussex. At 113 kilometres (70 miles) long, the River Medway is the longest river flowing through Sussex. The longest river entirely in Sussex is the River Arun, which is 60 kilometres (37 miles) long. Sussex's largest lakes are man-made reservoirs. The largest is Bewl Water on the Kent border, while the largest wholly within Sussex is Ardingly Reservoir.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<p>The coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Hampshire" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom. The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, blowing off the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast. Most of Sussex lies in <a href="/wiki/Hardiness_zone" title="Hardiness zone">Hardiness zone</a> 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.</p>
<p>Rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with 950 mm (37 in) of rainfall per year. The close proximity of Sussex to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Continent" title="The Continent">the Continent</a> of Europe, results in cold spells in winter and hot, humid weather in summer.</p>
<p>The climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea, which, because of its tendency to warm up slower than land, can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer. In the autumn months, the coast sometimes has higher temperatures. Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers; from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems.</p>
<p>In winter, the east winds can be as cold as further inland. <a href="/wiki/Selsey" title="Selsey">Selsey</a> is known as a <a href="/wiki/Tornado" title="Tornado">tornado</a> hotspot, with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986, 1998 and 2000, with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1,000 buildings.</p>
<p>The sunshine average is approximately 1900 hours a year, this is much higher than the UK average of 1340 hours a year.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conurbations">Conurbations</span></h3>
<p>Most of Sussex's population is distributed in an east-west line along the English Channel coast or on the east-west line of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A272" title="A272">A272</a>. The exception to this pattern is the 20th century north-south development on the <a href="/wiki/A23_road" title="A23 road">A23</a>-<a href="/wiki/Brighton_Main_Line" title="Brighton Main Line">Brighton line</a> <a href="/wiki/Transport_corridor" title="Transport corridor">corridor</a>, Sussex's main link to London. Sussex's population is dominated by the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation that, with a population of over 470,000, is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussex's population. According to the <a href="/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics" title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</a> urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 5 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population">Population</span></h2>
<p>The combined population of Sussex is about 1.6 million. In 2011, Sussex had a population density of 425 per km, higher than the average for England of 407 per km.</p>
<p>The earliest statement as to the population of Sussex is made by Bede, who describes the county as containing in 681 land of 7,000 families; allowing ten to a family (a reasonable estimate at that date), the total population would be 70,000.</p>
<p>In 1693 the county is stated to have contained 21,537 houses. The 1801 census found that the population was 159,311. The decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase of population during several centuries, although after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Massacre_of_St_Bartholomew" title="Massacre of St Bartholomew">massacre of St Bartholomew</a> upwards of 1,500 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Huguenots" title="Huguenots">Huguenots</a> landed at Rye, and in 1685, after the revocation of the <a href="/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes" title="Edict of Nantes">Edict of Nantes</a>, many more refugees were added to the county.</p>
<p>The area of the ancient county is 933,887 acres (377,931 ha) with a population in 1891 of 550,446 and in 1901 of 605,202.</p>

<p>Finds at <a href="/wiki/Eartham_Pit,_Boxgrove" title="Eartham Pit, Boxgrove">Eartham Pit</a> in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe, dating back some 500,000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or <a href="/wiki/Homo_heidelbergensis" title="Homo heidelbergensis">Homo heidelbergensis</a>. At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neanderthals" title="Neanderthals">Neanderthals</a> in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans. The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses, bison, <a href="/wiki/Mammoth" title="Mammoth">mammoth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Woolly_rhinoceros" title="Woolly rhinoceros">woolly rhinos</a>. Around 6000BC the ice sheet over the North Sea melted, sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards, creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their <a href="/wiki/Mesolithic" title="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> kinsmen to the south. Later in the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period, the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain's largest and most important <a href="/wiki/Flint" title="Flint">flint</a>-mining centres. The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, has been carbon-dated to 4500BC to 3750BC, making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain. Flint tools from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cissbury" title="Cissbury">Cissbury</a> have been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Sussex is rich in remains from the <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Ages</a>, in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the <a href="/wiki/Devil%27s_Jumps,_Treyford" title="Devil's Jumps, Treyford">Devil's Jumps</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cissbury_Ring" title="Cissbury Ring">Cissbury Ring</a>, one of Britain's largest hillforts. Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75BC people from the <a href="/wiki/Atrebates" title="Atrebates">Atrebates</a>, one of the tribes of the <a href="/wiki/Belgae" title="Belgae">Belgae</a>, a mix of Celtic and German stock, started invading and occupying southern Britain. This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> that temporarily occupied the south-east in 55BC. Soon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic <a href="/wiki/Regnenses" title="Regnenses">Regnenses</a> tribe under their leader <a href="/wiki/Commius" title="Commius">Commius</a> occupied the <a href="/wiki/Manhood_Peninsula" title="Manhood Peninsula">Manhood Peninsula</a>. <a href="/wiki/Tincomarus" title="Tincomarus">Tincomarus</a> and then <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cogidubnus" title="Cogidubnus">Cogidubnus</a> followed Commius as rulers of the Regnenses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roman_Canton">Roman Canton</span></h3>

<p>At the time of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an <i><a href="/wiki/Oppidum" title="Oppidum">oppidum</a></i> in the southern part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region. A number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the <a href="/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain" title="Roman conquest of Britain">Roman invasion of Britain</a> in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of <a href="/wiki/Richborough" title="Richborough">Richborough</a> in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee <a href="/wiki/Verica" title="Verica">Verica</a>, king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the <a href="/wiki/Catuvellauni" title="Catuvellauni">Catuvellauni</a>, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>Sussex was home to the magnificent <a href="/wiki/Fishbourne_Roman_Palace" title="Fishbourne Roman Palace">Roman Palace at Fishbourne</a>, by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps. Much of Sussex was a Roman canton of the <a href="/wiki/Regnenses" title="Regnenses">Regnenses</a> or Regni, with its capital at <a href="/wiki/Noviomagus_Reginorum" title="Noviomagus Reginorum">Noviomagus Reginorum</a>, modern-day Chichester. The Romans built villas, especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester, one of the best preserved being that at <a href="/wiki/Bignor" title="Bignor">Bignor</a>. Christianity first came to Sussex at this time, but faded away when the Romans left in the 5th century. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a>, probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the <a href="/wiki/End_of_Roman_rule_in_Britain" title="End of Roman rule in Britain">Roman departure from Britain</a> around 410 AD.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Saxon_Kingdom">Saxon Kingdom</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sussex" title="Kingdom of Sussex">Kingdom of Sussex</a></div>
<p>The foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, which states that in the year AD 477 <a href="/wiki/%C3%86lle_of_Sussex" title="Ælle of Sussex">Ælle</a> landed with his three sons. Having fought on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mercredesburne" title="Battle of Mercredesburne">Mearcredesburna</a>, it seems Aelle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty. After Aelle’s forces seized the <a href="/wiki/Saxon_Shore" title="Saxon Shore">Saxon Shore</a> fort of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anderida" title="Anderida">Anderida</a>, the South Saxons were able to gradually colonise free of Romano-British control and extend their territory westwards to link with the Saxon settlement at <a href="/wiki/Highdown_Hill" title="Highdown Hill">Highdown Hill</a>. Aelle was recognised as the first '<a href="/wiki/Bretwalda" title="Bretwalda">Bretwalda</a>' or overlord of southern Britain. He was probably the most senior of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> kings and led the ill-fated campaign against <a href="/wiki/King_Arthur" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mount_Badon" title="Mount Badon">Mount Badon</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of the 7th century, the region around Selsey and Chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom. In the 660s-670s, <a href="/wiki/%C3%86thelwealh_of_Sussex" title="Æthelwealh of Sussex">King Aethelwealh</a> of Sussex formed an alliance with the Mercian king <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wulfhere" title="Wulfhere">Wulfhere</a> and together they took the Isle of Wight from the West Saxons, probably at the battle of Biedanheafele. As Mercia's first Christian king, Wulfhere insisted that Æthelwealh also convert to Christianity. Æthelwealh was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baptised" title="Baptised">baptised</a> in Mercia, with Wulfhere as his <a href="/wiki/Baptism" title="Baptism">sponsor</a>. Wulfhere gave the Isle of Wight and Meon Valley to Aethelwealh, with Wulfhere acting as <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">overlord</a>. The alliance with Mercia was sealed with Æthelwealh taking the hand of Eabe, a Mercian princess in marriage.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wilfrid" title="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, the exiled bishop of York, came to Sussex in 681 and with King Æthelwealh's approval set up a mission to convert the people of Sussex to <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Æthelwealh gave Wilfrid land on the Manhood peninsula, close to his own royal estate and Wilfrid founded <a href="/wiki/Selsey_Abbey" title="Selsey Abbey">Selsey Abbey</a>. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh was killed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/C%C3%A6dwalla" title="Cædwalla">Cædwalla</a>, a prince of Wessex. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh's grant of land and Wilfrid built his Selsey Abbey. Cædwalla was driven out by the South Saxon nobles <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Berthun" title="Berthun">Berthun</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Andhun" title="Andhun">Andhun</a>.</p>
<p>The South Saxons fought off the West Saxons in 722 and again in 725. At the end of the 8th century, <a href="/wiki/Ealdwulf_of_Sussex" title="Ealdwulf of Sussex">Ealdwulf</a> was perhaps the last independent king of Sussex, after which Sussex and other southern kingdoms came increasingly under Mercian rule.

<p>Sussex was the venue for the momentous <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, the decisive victory in the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman conquest of England</a>. In September 1066, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_of_Normandy" title="William of Normandy">William of Normandy</a> landed with his forces at <a href="/wiki/Pevensey" title="Pevensey">Pevensey</a> and erected a wooden castle at <a href="/wiki/Hastings" title="Hastings">Hastings</a>, from which they raided the surrounding area. The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king, <a href="/wiki/Harold_Godwinson" title="Harold Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>, who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief <a href="/wiki/Family_seat" title="Family seat">seat</a> was probably in <a href="/wiki/Bosham" title="Bosham">Bosham</a>. After having marched his exhausted army all the way from Yorkshire, Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, where England's army was defeated and Harold was killed. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thegns" title="Thegns">thegns</a> were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. William built <a href="/wiki/Battle_Abbey" title="Battle Abbey">Battle Abbey</a> at the site of the battle, with the exact spot where Harold fell marked by the high altar.</p>
<p>Sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any English county under the Normans, for it was the heartland of King Harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion. The county was of great importance to the Normans; Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy. The county's existing sub-divisions, known as rapes, were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of William's most trusted barons. Castles were built to defend the territories including at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. Sussex's bishop, <a href="/wiki/%C3%86thelric_II" title="Æthelric II">Æthelric II</a>, was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with and William the Conqueror's personal chaplain, <a href="/wiki/Stigand_of_Selsey" title="Stigand of Selsey">Stigand</a>. The Normans also built <a href="/wiki/Chichester_Cathedral" title="Chichester Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a> and moved the seat of Sussex's bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex, including New Shoreham (the centre of modern Shoreham-by-Sea), Battle, Arundel, Uckfield and Winchelsea.</p>
<p>In 1264, the Sussex Downs were the location of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lewes" title="Battle of Lewes">Battle of Lewes</a>, in which <a href="/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester" title="Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a> and his fellow barons captured Prince Edward (later <a href="/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a>), the son and heir of <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_England" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a>. The subsequent treaty, known as the <a href="/wiki/Mise_of_Lewes" title="Mise of Lewes">Mise of Lewes</a>, led to Montfort summoning the <a href="/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort%27s_Parliament" title="Simon de Montfort's Parliament">first parliament</a> in English history without any prior royal authorisation.

<p>Like the rest of the country, the Church of England's split with Rome during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> was felt in Sussex. In 1538 there was a royal order for the demolition of the shrine of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saint_Richard" title="Saint Richard">Saint Richard</a>, in Chichester Cathedral, with Thomas Cromwell saying that there was "a certain kind of idolatry about the shrine". In the reign of <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary</a>, 41 people in Sussex were burnt at the stake for their Protestant beliefs.

<p>The Sussex coast was greatly modified by the social movement of <a href="/wiki/Sea_bathing" title="Sea bathing">sea bathing</a> for health which became fashionable among the wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. Resorts developed all along the coast, including at Brighton, Hastings, Worthing, and Bognor. At the beginning of the 19th century agricultural labourers' conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed, those in work faced their wages being forced down. Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation. The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots, first in neighbouring Kent, and then in Sussex, where they lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the <a href="/wiki/Swing_Riots" title="Swing Riots">Swing Riots</a>.</p>
<p>Railways spread across Sussex in the 19th century and county councils were created for Sussex's eastern and western divisions in 1889.</p>

Over a period of less than five hours the 17 officers and 349 men were killed, including 12 sets of brothers, including three from one family. A further 1,000 men were wounded or taken prisoner.</p>
<p>With the declaration of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Sussex found itself part of the country's frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Britain" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a> and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed.

<p>A rape was a traditional sub-division of the county of Sussex.

Each rape was split into several <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hundred_(division)" title="Hundred (division)">hundreds</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest, there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. The <a href="/wiki/Rape_of_Bramber" title="Rape of Bramber">rape of Bramber</a> was created later in the 11th century and the <a href="/wiki/Rape_of_Chichester" title="Rape of Chichester">rape of Chichester</a> was created in the 13th century.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_local_authority_areas">Modern local authority areas</span></h4>
<p>Sussex is divided into two administrative counties and one unitary authority, Brighton and Hove. The divisions of east Sussex and west Sussex have their roots in the church's division of the county at the river Adur into east and west parts (divided from at least the 11th century into the <a href="/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Chichester" title="Archdeacon of Chichester">archdeaconry of Chichester</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archdeaconry_of_Lewes" title="Archdeaconry of Lewes">archdeaconry of Lewes</a>). With Sussex's cathedral located at Chichester in the far west of the county, 9 miles from the western boundary and 90 miles from the eastern boundary, it became practical to divide the county into two sections. The three eastern rapes of Sussex became east Sussex and the three western rapes became west Sussex.</p>
<p>An act of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII</a> dating from 1504 directed that, for convenience, the two halves of the county should have separate administrations (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quarter_Sessions" title="Quarter Sessions">Quarter Sessions</a>).

<p>Created in the fifth century, the kingdom of Sussex continued until its absorption into the kingdom of Wessex and later England in 825. In charters, Sussex's monarchs were sometimes referred to as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ealdormen" title="Ealdormen">ealdormen</a>, or Dux in Latin, which is sometimes translated as 'duke'. The early Earls of Arundel, up to 1243, were often also called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earls_of_Sussex" title="Earls of Sussex">Earls of Sussex</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<p>Much of the Sussex Weald consists of wet sticky clays or drought-prone acid sands and is often broken up into to small irregular fields and woods by the topography, making it unsuitable for intensive arable farming. In these areas pastoral or mixed farming has always been the pattern, with field boundaries often little changed since the medieval period. Sussex cattle are the descendants of the draught oxen, which continued to be used in the Weald longer than in other parts of England. The chalk downlands were traditionally grazed by large numbers of small <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southdown_(sheep)" title="Southdown (sheep)">Southdown</a> sheep, suited to the low fertility of the pasture, until the coming of artificial fertiliser made cereal growing worthwhile. There are still fishing fleets, notably at Rye and Hastings, but the number of boats is much reduced. There are working harbours at Rye, Hastings, Newhaven and Shoreham; whilst Pagham and Chichester harbours cater for leisure craft, as does Brighton Marina. Sussex had an iron working industry since the Roman period. The large supply of wood in the county made it a favourable centre for the industry, all smelting being done with charcoal till the middle of the 18th century. The glass making industry started on the Sussex/Surrey border in the early 13th century and flourished till the 17th century. The Mid Sussex area had a thriving clay industry in the first quarter of the 20th century.</p>

GVA per capita varies significantly between Sussex's three upper tier local authority areas: in 2009 Brighton and Hove had the highest GVA per head in Sussex with an average of £20,611 (101 per cent of the UK average). The local authority area of East Sussex has the lowest with a GVA per head of £13,521, 66 per cent of the UK average. There is also serious deprivation in Sussex comparable to the most deprived UK inner city areas. Some areas of Sussex are in the top 5 per cent most deprived in the UK and, in some areas, two-thirds of children are living in poverty. In 2011, two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Local_Enterprise_Partnership" title="Local Enterprise Partnership">Local Enterprise Partnerships</a> were formed to improve the economy in Sussex.
