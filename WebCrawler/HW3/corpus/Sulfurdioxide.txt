<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is primarily produced for sulfuric acid manufacture (see <a href="/wiki/Contact_process" title="Contact process">contact process</a>). In the United States in 1979, 23.6 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide were used in this way, compared with 150 thousand tonnes used for other purposes. Most sulfur dioxide is produced by the combustion of elemental sulfur. Some sulfur dioxide is also produced by roasting pyrite and other sulfide ores in air.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Combustion_routes">Combustion routes</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is the product of the burning of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> or of burning materials that contain sulfur:</p>

<p>To aid combustion, liquefied sulfur (140–150 °C) is sprayed through an atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur with a large surface area. The reaction is exothermic, and the combustion produces temperatures of 1000–1600 °C. The significant amount of heat produced is recovered by steam generation that can subsequently be converted to electricity.</p>
<p>The combustion of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> and organosulfur compounds proceeds similarly. For example:</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roasting_(metallurgy)" title="Roasting (metallurgy)">roasting</a> of sulfide ores such as <a href="/wiki/Pyrite" title="Pyrite">pyrite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sphalerite" title="Sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cinnabar" title="Cinnabar">cinnabar</a> (mercury sulfide) also releases SO<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<p>A combination of these reactions is responsible for the largest source of sulfur dioxide, volcanic eruptions. These events can release millions of tonnes of SO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reduction_of_higher_oxides">Reduction of higher oxides</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide can also be a byproduct in the manufacture of <a href="/wiki/Calcium_silicate" title="Calcium silicate">calcium silicate</a> <a href="/wiki/Cement" title="Cement">cement</a>; <a href="/wiki/Calcium_sulfate" title="Calcium sulfate">CaSO<sub>4</sub></a> is heated with <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a> and sand in this process:</p>

<p>Until the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid and cement were produced by this process in <a href="/wiki/Whitehaven" title="Whitehaven">Whitehaven</a>, England. Upon being mixed with <a href="/wiki/Shale" title="Shale">shale</a> or <a href="/wiki/Marl" title="Marl">marl</a>, and roasted, the sulfate liberated sulfur dioxide gas, used in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produced calcium silicate, a precursor in cement production.</p>
<p>On a laboratory scale, the action of hot concentrated sulfuric acid on copper <a href="/wiki/Swarf" title="Swarf">turnings</a> produces sulfur dioxide.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_sulfite">From sulfite</span></h3>
<p>Sulfite results from the reaction of aqueous base and sulfur dioxide. The reverse reaction involves acidification of <a href="/wiki/Sodium_metabisulfite" title="Sodium metabisulfite">sodium metabisulfite</a>:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactions">Reactions</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_reactions">Industrial reactions</span></h3>
<p>Treatment of basic solutions with sulfur dioxide affords sulfite salts:</p>

<p>Featuring sulfur in the +4 oxidation state, sulfur dioxide is a <a href="/wiki/Reducing_agent" title="Reducing agent">reducing agent</a>. It is oxidized by halogens to give the sulfuryl halides, such as <a href="/wiki/Sulfuryl_chloride" title="Sulfuryl chloride">sulfuryl chloride</a>:</p>

<p>Sulfur dioxide is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidising_agent" title="Oxidising agent">oxidising agent</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Claus_process" title="Claus process">Claus process</a>, which is conducted on a large scale in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_refineries" title="Oil refineries">oil refineries</a>. Here, sulfur dioxide is reduced by hydrogen sulfide to give elemental sulfur:</p>

<p>The sequential oxidation of sulfur dioxide followed by its hydration is used in the production of sulfuric acid.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Laboratory_reactions">Laboratory reactions</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is one of the few common acidic yet reducing gases. It turns moist litmus pink (being acidic), then white (due to its bleaching effect). It may be identified by bubbling it through a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dichromate" title="Dichromate">dichromate</a> solution, turning the solution from orange to green (Cr (aq)). It can also reduce ferric ions to ferrous</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide can react with certain 1,3-<a href="/wiki/Diene" title="Diene">dienes</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Cheletropic_reaction" title="Cheletropic reaction">cheletropic reaction</a> to form cyclic <a href="/wiki/Sulfone" title="Sulfone">sulfones</a>. This reaction is exploited on an industrial scale for the synthesis of <a href="/wiki/Sulfolane" title="Sulfolane">sulfolane</a>, which is an important solvent in the petrochemical industry.</p>

<p>Sulfur dioxide can bind to metal ions as a <a href="/wiki/Ligand" title="Ligand">ligand</a> to form <a href="/wiki/Metal_sulfur_dioxide_complex" title="Metal sulfur dioxide complex">metal sulfur dioxide complexes</a>, typically where the transition metal is in oxidation state 0 or +1. Many different bonding modes (geometries) are recognized, but in most cases, the ligand is monodentate, attached to the metal through sulfur, which can be either planar and pyramidal <a href="/wiki/Hapticity" title="Hapticity">η</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Precursor_to_sulfuric_acid">Precursor to sulfuric acid</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is an intermediate in the production of sulfuric acid, being converted to <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_trioxide" title="Sulfur trioxide">sulfur trioxide</a>, and then to <a href="/wiki/Oleum" title="Oleum">oleum</a>, which is made into sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the <a href="/wiki/Contact_process" title="Contact process">contact process</a>. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_preservative">As a preservative</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a <a href="/wiki/Preservative" title="Preservative">preservative</a> for dried <a href="/wiki/Apricot" title="Apricot">apricots</a>, dried <a href="/wiki/Common_fig" title="Common fig">figs</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Dried_fruit" title="Dried fruit">dried fruits</a>, owing to its <a href="/wiki/Antimicrobial" title="Antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> properties, and is called <a href="/wiki/E_number" title="E number">E220</a> when used in this way in Europe. As a preservative, it maintains the colorful appearance of the fruit and prevents <a href="/wiki/Decomposition" title="Decomposition">rotting</a>. It is also added to sulfured <a href="/wiki/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_winemaking">In winemaking</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide was used by the Romans in winemaking, when they discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels keeps them fresh and free from vinegar smell.</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is still an important compound in <a href="/wiki/Winemaking" title="Winemaking">winemaking</a>, and is measured in parts per million in wine. It is present even in so-called unsulfurated wine at concentrations of up to 10 mg/L. It serves as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antibiotic" title="Antibiotic">antibiotic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Antioxidant" title="Antioxidant">antioxidant</a>, protecting wine from spoilage by bacteria and oxidation. Its antimicrobial action also helps to minimize volatile acidity. Sulfur dioxide is responsible for the words "contains <a href="/wiki/Sulfite" title="Sulfite">sulfites</a>" found on wine labels.</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of <a href="/wiki/Acetaldehyde" title="Acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>, varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require "contains sulfites" on the label by US and EU laws. The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and rosé wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.</p>
<p>SO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation. Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of <a href="/wiki/Cork_taint" title="Cork taint">cork taint</a>, a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. Compounds of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) are now used extensively as cleaning products in wineries due to their efficiency, and because these compounds do not affect the wine or equipment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_reducing_agent">As a reducing agent</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is also a good <a href="/wiki/Reducing_agent" title="Reducing agent">reductant</a>. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances. Specifically, it is a useful reducing <a href="/wiki/Bleach" title="Bleach">bleach</a> for <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">papers</a> and delicate materials such as clothes. This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">Oxygen</a> in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color. In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release. Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to <a href="/wiki/Chloride" title="Chloride">chloride</a>.</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is not present to any extent. However, such solutions do show spectra of the hydrogen sulfite ion, HSO<sub>3</sub>, by reaction with water, and it is in fact the actual reducing agent present:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biochemical_and_biomedical_roles">Biochemical and biomedical roles</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is toxic in large amounts. It or its conjugate base bisulfite is produced biologically as an intermediate in both sulfate-reducing organisms and in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as well. The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood. Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_stretch_receptors" title="Pulmonary stretch receptors">pulmonary stretch receptors</a> and abolishes the <a href="/wiki/Hering%E2%80%93Breuer_reflex" title="Hering–Breuer reflex">Hering–Breuer inflation reflex</a>.</p>
<p>It was shown that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a role in diminishing an experimental <a href="/wiki/Lung" title="Lung">lung</a> damage caused by <a href="/wiki/Oleic_acid" title="Oleic acid">oleic acid</a>. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> that produces endogenous SO<sub>2</sub> significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding <a href="/wiki/Acetylcysteine" title="Acetylcysteine">acetylcysteine</a> or <a href="/wiki/Glutathione" title="Glutathione">glutathione</a> to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO<sub>2</sub> produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.</p>
<p>It is considered that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cardiac" title="Cardiac">cardiac</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blood_vessel" title="Blood vessel">blood vessel</a> function, and aberrant or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism can contribute to several different cardiovascular diseases, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arterial_hypertension" title="Arterial hypertension">arterial hypertension</a>, <a href="/wiki/Atherosclerosis" title="Atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pulmonary_arterial_hypertension" title="Pulmonary arterial hypertension">pulmonary arterial hypertension</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stenocardia" title="Stenocardia">stenocardia</a>.</p>
<p>It was shown that in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of <a href="/wiki/Homocysteine" title="Homocysteine">homocysteine</a> is higher and the level of endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered homocysteine to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients.</p>
<p>Endogenous sulfur dioxide also has been shown to lower the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cell_proliferation" title="Cell proliferation">proliferation</a> rate of endothelial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smooth_muscle" title="Smooth muscle">smooth muscle</a> cells in blood vessels, via lowering the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MAPK" title="MAPK">MAPK</a> activity and activating <a href="/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase" title="Adenylyl cyclase">adenylyl cyclase</a> and <a href="/wiki/Protein_kinase_A" title="Protein kinase A">protein kinase A</a>. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is one of important mechanisms of hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels and their <a href="/wiki/Stenosis" title="Stenosis">stenosis</a>, so it is an important pathogenetic mechanism in arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Endogenous sulfur dioxide in low concentrations causes endothelium-dependent <a href="/wiki/Vasodilation" title="Vasodilation">vasodilation</a>. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation and has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating and bronchodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent <a href="/wiki/Calcium_channel" title="Calcium channel">calcium channels</a> and L-type ("dihydropyridine") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Endogenous sulfur dioxide also diminishes myocardial damage, caused by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isoproterenol" title="Isoproterenol">isoproterenol</a> <a href="/wiki/Adrenergic" title="Adrenergic">adrenergic</a> hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve.</p>

<p>Being easily condensed and possessing a high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_of_evaporation" title="Heat of evaporation">heat of evaporation</a>, sulfur dioxide is a candidate material for refrigerants. Prior to the development of <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbons</a>, sulfur dioxide was used as a <a href="/wiki/Refrigerant" title="Refrigerant">refrigerant</a> in home refrigerators.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_reagent_and_solvent_in_the_laboratory">As a reagent and solvent in the laboratory</span></h3>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is a versatile inert solvent widely used for dissolving highly oxidizing salts.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="As_an_air_pollutant">As an air pollutant</span></h2>

<p>Sulfur dioxide is a noticeable component in the atmosphere, especially following volcanic eruptions. According to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the amount of sulfur dioxide released in the U.S. per year was:</p>


<p>Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human health. In addition, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the habitat suitability for plant communities, as well as animal life. Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> and atmospheric particulates. Due largely to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">US</a> EPA’s <a href="/wiki/Acid_Rain_Program" title="Acid Rain Program">Acid Rain Program</a>, the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002. This improvement resulted in part from <a href="/wiki/Flue-gas_desulfurization" title="Flue-gas desulfurization">flue-gas desulfurization</a>, a technology that enables SO<sub>2</sub> to be chemically bound in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_plant" title="Power plant">power plants</a> burning sulfur-containing <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">oil</a>. In particular, <a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" title="Calcium oxide">calcium oxide (lime)</a> reacts with sulfur dioxide to form <a href="/wiki/Calcium_sulfite" title="Calcium sulfite">calcium sulfite</a>:</p>

<p>Sulfur can be removed from coal during burning by using limestone as a bed material in <a href="/wiki/Fluidized_bed_combustion" title="Fluidized bed combustion">fluidized bed combustion</a>.</p>
<p>Sulfur can also be removed from fuels before burning, preventing formation of SO<sub>2</sub> when the fuel is burnt.
