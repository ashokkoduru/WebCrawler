<p><b>Wildlife</b> traditionally refers to un<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domesticated" title="Domesticated">domesticated</a> <a href="/wiki/Animal" title="Animal">animal</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Species_(biology)" title="Species (biology)">species</a>, but has come to include all <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a> that grow or live wild in an area without being <a href="/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduced</a> by <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a>.</p>
<p>Wildlife can be found in all <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including the most developed <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban</a> sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.</p>
<p>Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways including the legal, social, and moral sense. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and gerbils. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the <a href="/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources" title="Exploitation of natural resources">exploitation</a> of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.</p>
<p>The global wildlife population has decreased by 52 percent between 1970 and 2014, according to a report by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund" title="World Wildlife Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthropologists" title="Anthropologists">Anthropologists</a> believe that the <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> people and <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> relied on wildlife, both plants and animals, for their food. In fact, some species may have been hunted to <a href="/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinction</a> by early human hunters. Today, hunting, <a href="/wiki/Fishing" title="Fishing">fishing</a>, and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world. In other areas, hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a <a href="/wiki/Sport" title="Sport">sport</a> or <a href="/wiki/Recreation" title="Recreation">recreation</a>, with the edible meat as mostly a side benefit of it. Meat sourced from wildlife that is not traditionally regarded as game is known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bush_meat" title="Bush meat">bush meat</a>. The increasing demand for wildlife as a source of traditional food in <a href="/wiki/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East Asia</a> is decimating populations of <a href="/wiki/Shark" title="Shark">sharks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Primate" title="Primate">primates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pangolin" title="Pangolin">pangolins</a> and other animals, which they believe have aphrodisiac properties.</p>
<p>In November 2008, almost 900 plucked and "oven-ready" owls and other protected wildlife species were confiscated by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in Malaysia, according to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TRAFFIC" title="TRAFFIC">TRAFFIC</a>. The animals were believed to be bound for China, to be sold in wild meat restaurants. Most are listed in <a href="/wiki/CITES" title="CITES">CITES</a> (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) which prohibits or restricts such trade.</p>

<p>A November 2008 report from biologist and author Sally Kneidel, PhD, documented numerous wildlife species for sale in informal markets along the Amazon River, including wild-caught marmosets sold for as little as $1.60 (5 Peruvian soles). Many Amazon species, including peccaries, agoutis, turtles, turtle eggs, anacondas, armadillos, etc., are sold primarily as food. Others in these informal markets, such as monkeys and parrots, are destined for the pet trade, often smuggled into the United States. Still other Amazon species are popular ingredients in traditional medicines sold in local markets. The medicinal value of animal parts is based largely on superstition.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h2>
<p>Many animal species have spiritual significance in different cultures around the world, and they and their products may be used as <a href="/wiki/Sacred" title="Sacred">sacred</a> objects in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious" title="Religious">religious</a> rituals. For example, <a href="/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawks</a> and their <a href="/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> have great <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cultural" title="Cultural">cultural</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spirituality" title="Spirituality">spiritual</a> value to <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a> as religious objects.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Muslims" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> conduct sacrifices on Eid-ul-Adha to commemorate the sacrificial spirit of Ibrahim [Abraham] in love of God. Camels, sheep, goats, and cows may be offered as sacrifice during the three days of Eid.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h2>
<p>Many nations have established their tourism sector around their natural wildlife. South Africa has, for example, many opportunities for tourists to see the country's wildlife in its national parks, such as the Kruger Park. In South India the Periar Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandipur National Park and Mudamalai Wildlife Sanctuary are situated around and in forests. India is home to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries showing the diversity of its wildlife, much of its unique fauna, and excels in the range. There are 89 national parks, 13 bio reserves and more than 400 wildlife sanctuaries across India which are the best places to go to see tigers, lions, elephants, rhinoceros, birds, and other wildlife which reflect the importance that the country places on nature and wildlife conservation.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Destruction">Destruction</span></h2>

<p>This subsection focuses on <a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">anthropogenic</a> forms of wildlife destruction.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources" title="Exploitation of natural resources">Exploitation</a> of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> 130,000 – 70,000 years ago. The rate of <a href="/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinctions</a> of entire species of plants and animals across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely believed that we are in the sixth great extinction event on this planet; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holocene_Mass_Extinction" title="Holocene Mass Extinction">Holocene Mass Extinction</a>.</p>
<p>Destruction of wildlife does not always lead to an extinction of the species in question, however, the dramatic loss of entire species across Earth dominates any review of wildlife destruction as extinction is the level of damage to a wild population from which there is no return.</p>
<p>The four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill, <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation" title="Habitat fragmentation">fragmentation</a>, impact of introduced species and chains of extinction.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overkill">Overkill</span></h3>
<p>Wildlife is an invaluable treasure but it is being exploited due to illegal trade of many of its species.Overkill happens whenever hunting occurs at rates greater than the reproductive capacity of the population is being exploited. The effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow growing populations such as many larger species of fish. Initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted, an increased availability of resources (food, etc.) is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as <a href="/wiki/Density_dependence" title="Density dependence">density dependent</a> inhibition is lowered. Hunting, <a href="/wiki/Fishing" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and so on, has lowered the competition between members of a population. However, if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young, the population will begin to <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">decrease in numbers</a>.</p>
<p>Populations that are confined to islands, whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an “island” for the species concerned, have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population declines following <a href="/wiki/Unsustainable_fishing_methods" title="Unsustainable fishing methods">unsustainable hunting</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">Habitat destruction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation" title="Habitat fragmentation">Habitat fragmentation</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory. Many processes associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species. In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape. Agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented, or relictual, habitat. Farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.</p>
<p>Examples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals, changes to natural fire regimes, forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Impact_of_introduced_species">Impact of introduced species</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mice" title="Mice">Mice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbits</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dandelion" title="Dandelion">dandelions</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Poison_ivy" title="Poison ivy">poison ivy</a> are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world. Frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates. The reasons for this have not always been clear and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved. The reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully. Occasionally, however, some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly, having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they have become part.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chains_of_extinction">Chains of extinction</span></h3>
<p>This final group is one of secondary effects. All wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them. Large <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herbivorous" title="Herbivorous">herbivorous</a> animals such as the <a href="/wiki/Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> have populations of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insectivorous" title="Insectivorous">insectivorous</a> birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo. Should the hippo die out, so too will these groups of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Birds" title="Birds">birds</a>, leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected. Also referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Domino_effect" title="Domino effect">domino effect</a>, this series of <a href="/wiki/Chain_reaction" title="Chain reaction">chain reactions</a> is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any <a href="/wiki/Biocoenosis" title="Biocoenosis">ecological community</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is the <a href="/wiki/Black_drongo" title="Black drongo">black drongos</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cattle_egret" title="Cattle egret">cattle egrets</a> found in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. These birds feed on insects on the back of cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free. Destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases.</p>
