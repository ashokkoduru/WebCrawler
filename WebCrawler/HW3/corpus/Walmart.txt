<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1945.E2.80.9369:_Early_history">1945–69: Early history</span></h3>

<p>In 1945, a businessman and a former <a href="/wiki/J._C._Penney" title="J. C. Penney">J. C. Penney</a> employee, <a href="/wiki/Sam_Walton" title="Sam Walton">Sam Walton</a>, purchased a branch of the <a href="/wiki/Ben_Franklin_(company)" title="Ben Franklin (company)">Ben Franklin</a> stores from the <a href="/wiki/Butler_Brothers" title="Butler Brothers">Butler Brothers</a>. His primary focus was on selling products at low prices to get higher-volume sales at a lower <a href="/wiki/Profit_margin" title="Profit margin">profit margin</a>, portraying it as a crusade for the consumer. He experienced setbacks, because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high, but he was able to find lower-cost suppliers than those used by other stores. He passed on the savings in the product pricing. Sales increased 45<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent in his first year of ownership to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$105,000</span> in revenue, which increased to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$140,000</span> the next year and <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$175,000</span> the year after that. Within the fifth year, the store was generating <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$250,000</span> in revenue. When the lease for the location expired, Walton was unable to reach an agreement for renewal, so he opened up a new store at 105 N. Main Street in Bentonville, naming it "Walton's Five and Dime". That store is now the Walmart Museum.</p>





<p>On July 2, 1962, Walton opened the first Walmart Discount City store at 719<span class="nowrap"> </span>W. Walnut Street in <a href="/wiki/Rogers,_Arkansas" title="Rogers, Arkansas">Rogers, Arkansas</a>. The building is now occupied by a hardware store and an antique mall, while the company's "Store #1"‍—‌since relocated to a larger discount store and now expanded to a Supercenter‍—‌is located several blocks west at 2110 W. Walnut Street. Within its first five years, the company expanded to 24<span class="nowrap"> </span>stores across <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> and reached <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$12.6<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> in sales. In 1968, it opened its first stores outside Arkansas, in <a href="/wiki/Sikeston,_Missouri" title="Sikeston, Missouri">Sikeston, Missouri</a> and <a href="/wiki/Claremore,_Oklahoma" title="Claremore, Oklahoma">Claremore, Oklahoma</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1969.E2.80.9390:_Incorporation_and_growth_as_a_regional_power">1969–90: Incorporation and growth as a regional power</span></h3>
<p>The company was <a href="/wiki/Incorporation_(business)" title="Incorporation (business)">incorporated</a> as <b>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</b> on October 31, 1969. In 1970, it opened its home office and first distribution center in <a href="/wiki/Bentonville,_Arkansas" title="Bentonville, Arkansas">Bentonville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. It had 38<span class="nowrap"> </span>stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$44.2<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span>. It began trading stock as a <a href="/wiki/Public_company" title="Public company">publicly held company</a> on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="New York Stock Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>. The first <a href="/wiki/Stock_split" title="Stock split">stock split</a> occurred in May 1971 at a price of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$47</span>. By this time, Walmart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As it moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125<span class="nowrap"> </span>stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$340.3<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span>. Walmart opened its first Texas store in <a href="/wiki/Mount_Pleasant,_Texas" title="Mount Pleasant, Texas">Mount Pleasant</a> on November 11, 1975.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Walmart continued to grow rapidly, and by its 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 stores with sales of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$15.9<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> and 200,000 associates. This year also marked the completion of the company's satellite network, a <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$24<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> investment linking all operating units with the Bentonville office via two-way voice and data transmission and one-way video communication. At the time, it was the largest private satellite network, allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate to stores. In 1988, Walton stepped down as CEO and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/David_Glass_(businessman)" title="David Glass (businessman)">David Glass</a>. Walton remained as Chairman of the Board.</p>

<p>In 1988, the first Wal-Mart Supercenter opened in <a href="/wiki/Washington,_Missouri" title="Washington, Missouri">Washington, Missouri</a>. Thanks to its superstores, it surpassed <a href="/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us" title='Toys "R" Us'>Toys "R" Us</a> in toy sales in the late-1990s.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1990.E2.80.932005:_Retail_rise_to_multinational_status">1990–2005: Retail rise to multinational status</span></h3>
<p>While it was the No. 3 retailer in the U.S., Walmart was more profitable than rivals Kmart and Sears by the late 1980s. By 1990, it became the largest U.S. retailer by revenue.</p>
<p>Prior to the summer of 1990, Walmart had no presence on the West Coast or in the Northeast (except for a single Sam's Club in New Jersey which opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year, it opened its first stores in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, respectively. By the mid-1990s, it was far and away the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994. Walmart stores opened throughout the rest of the U.S., with Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1995.</p>
<p>The company also opened stores outside North America, entering South America in 1995 with stores in Argentina and Brazil; and Europe in July 1999, buying <a href="/wiki/Asda" title="Asda">Asda</a> in the United Kingdom for <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$10<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>.</p>
<p>In 1998, Walmart introduced the Neighborhood Market concept with three stores in <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. By 2005, estimates indicate that the company controlled about 20 percent of the retail grocery and consumables business.</p>
<p>In 2000, <a href="/wiki/Lee_Scott_(businessman)" title="Lee Scott (businessman)">H. Lee Scott</a> became Walmart's President and CEO, as the company's sales increased to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$165<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>. In 2002, it was listed for the first time as America's largest corporation on the <a href="/wiki/Fortune_500" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> list, with revenues of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$219.8<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> and profits of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$6.7<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>. It has remained there every year, except in 2006 and 2009.</p>
<p>In 2005, Walmart reported <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$312.4<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> in sales, more than 6,200 facilities around the world – including 3,800 stores in the United States and 2,800 elsewhere, employing more than 1.6<span class="nowrap"> </span>million associates. Its U.S. presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained more than 60 miles (97 kilometres) from the nearest store.</p>
<p>As Walmart rapidly expanded into the world's largest corporation, many critics worried about its effect on local communities, particularly small towns with many "<a href="/wiki/Small_business" title="Small business">mom and pop</a>" stores. There have been several studies on the economic impact of Walmart on small towns and local businesses, jobs, and taxpayers. In one, Kenneth Stone, a Professor of Economics at <a href="/wiki/Iowa_State_University" title="Iowa State University">Iowa State University</a>, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening. However, in another study, he compared the changes to what small town shops had faced in the past – including the development of the railroads, the advent of the Sears Roebuck catalog, as well as the arrival of shopping malls – and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after Walmart arrives. A later study in collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_State_University" title="Mississippi State University">Mississippi State University</a> showed that there are "both positive and negative impacts on existing stores in the area where the new supercenter locates."</p>
<p>In the aftermath of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in September 2005, Walmart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the disaster, donating <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$20<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> in cash, 1,500 truckloads of merchandise, food for 100,000 meals, as well as the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers. An independent study by Steven Horwitz of <a href="/wiki/St._Lawrence_University" title="St. Lawrence University">St. Lawrence University</a> found that Walmart, <a href="/wiki/The_Home_Depot" title="The Home Depot">The Home Depot</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lowe%27s" title="Lowe's">Lowe's</a> made use of their local knowledge about supply chains, infrastructure, decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before FEMA began its response. While the company was overall lauded for its quick response – amidst <a href="/wiki/Criticism_of_government_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina" title="Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina">criticism</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" title="Federal Emergency Management Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> – several critics were nonetheless quick to point out that there still remained issues with the company's labor relations.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2005.E2.80.9310:_Initiatives">2005–10: Initiatives</span></h3>

<p>In October 2005, Walmart announced several environmental measures to increase <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a>. The primary goals included spending <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$500<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> a year to increase fuel efficiency in Walmart's truck fleet by 25 percent over three years and double it within ten, reduce <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions by 20 percent in seven years, reduce energy use at stores by 30 percent, and cut solid waste from U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs by 25 percent in three years. CEO Lee Scott said that Walmart's goal was to be a "good steward for the environment" and ultimately use only <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources and produce zero waste. The company also designed three new experimental stores with <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> solar panels, <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>-capable boilers, water-cooled refrigerators, and <a href="/wiki/Xeriscaping" title="Xeriscaping">xeriscape</a> gardens. Despite much criticism of its environmental record, Walmart took a few steps in what some viewed as a positive direction, which included becoming the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world, as well as reducing packaging and energy costs. Walmart also spent nearly a year working with outside consultants to discover the company's total environmental impact and find areas for improvement. Walmart has also recently created its own <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_industry" title="Electric power industry">electric company</a> in Texas, <i>Texas Retail Energy</i>, and plans to supply its stores with cheap power purchased at wholesale prices. Through this new venture, the company expects to save <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$15<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> annually and also to lay the groundwork and infrastructure to sell electricity to Texas consumers in the future.</p>
<p>In March 2006, Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic. The company launched a new Supercenter concept in <a href="/wiki/Plano,_Texas" title="Plano, Texas">Plano, Texas</a>, intended to compete against stores seen as more upscale and appealing, such as <a href="/wiki/Target_Corporation" title="Target Corporation">Target</a>. The new store has wood floors, wider aisles, a <a href="/wiki/Sushi" title="Sushi">sushi</a> bar, a coffee/sandwich shop with free <a href="/wiki/Wi-Fi" title="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> Internet access, and more expensive beers, wines, electronics, and other goods. The exterior has a hunter green background behind the Walmart letters, similar to Neighborhood Market by Walmarts, instead of the blue previously used at its supercenters.</p>
<p>On September 12, 2007, Walmart introduced new advertising with the <a href="/wiki/Slogan" title="Slogan">slogan</a>, "<i>Save money. Live better.</i>", replacing "<i>Always Low Prices, Always</i>", which it had used for the previous 19 years. <a href="/wiki/Global_Insight" title="Global Insight">Global Insight</a>, which conducted the research that supported the ads, found that Walmart's <a href="/wiki/Price_level" title="Price level">price level</a> reduction resulted in savings for consumers of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$287<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> in 2006, which equated to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$957</span> per person or <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$2,500</span> per household (up 7.3 percent from the 2004 savings estimate of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$2,329</span>).</p>

<p>On June 30, 2008, Walmart removed the hyphen from its logo and replaced the star with a <i>Spark</i> symbol that resembles a sunburst, flower, or star. The new logo received mixed reviews from design critics, who questioned whether the new logo was as bold as those of competitors, such as the <a href="/wiki/Target_Corporation" title="Target Corporation">Target</a> bullseye or as instantly recognizable as the previous company logo, which was used for 18 years. The new logo made its debut on the company's website on July 1, 2008. Walmart's U.S. locations were to update store logos in the fall of 2008, as part of an ongoing evolution of its brand. Walmart Canada started to adopt the logo for its stores in early 2009.</p>
<p>On March 20, 2009, Walmart announced that it was paying a combined <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$933.6<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> in bonuses to every full and part-time hourly worker. This was in addition to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$788.8<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> in <a href="/wiki/Profit_sharing" title="Profit sharing">profit sharing</a>, <a href="/wiki/401(k)" title="401(k)">401(k)</a> pension contributions, hundreds of millions of dollars in merchandise discounts, and contributions to the employees' stock purchase plan. While the economy at large was in an ongoing <a href="/wiki/Recession" title="Recession">recession</a>, Walmart, the largest retailer in the U.S., reported solid financial figures for the most recent fiscal year (ending January 31, 2009), with <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$401.2<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> in net sales, a gain of 7.2<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent from the prior year. Income from continuing operations increased 3<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$13.3<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>, and earnings per share rose 6<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$3.35</span>.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2010, the company confirmed it was acquiring <a href="/wiki/Streaming_media" title="Streaming media">video streaming</a> company <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vudu,_Inc." title="Vudu, Inc.">Vudu, Inc.</a> for an estimated <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$100<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span>.</p>

<li>In July 2014, American actor and comedian <a href="/wiki/Tracy_Morgan" title="Tracy Morgan">Tracy Morgan</a> launched a lawsuit against Walmart seeking punitive damages over a multi-car pile-up which the suit alleges was caused by the driver of one of the firm's tractor-trailers who had not slept for 24 hours. Morgan's limousine was apparently hit by the trailer, injuring him and two fellow passengers and killing a fourth, fellow comedian James McNair. Walmart settled with the McNair family for $10 million, while admitting no liability. Morgan and Walmart reached a settlement in 2015 for an undisclosed amount, though Walmart later accused its insurers of "bad faith" in refusing to pay the settlement.</li>
<li>In 2015, the company closed five stores on short notice for plumbing repairs. However, employees and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers_International_Union" title="United Food and Commercial Workers International Union">United Food and Commercial Workers International Union</a> (UFCW) alleged some stores were closed in retaliation for strikes aimed at increasing wages and improving working conditions.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Growing_crime_problem">Growing crime problem</span></h3>
<p>Police reports from dozens of Walmart stores suggest the number of petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide in 2016 will be in the hundreds of thousands. Additionally, more than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings and multiple stabbings, shootings, and murders, have occurred at the nation’s 4,500 Walmarts as of August 2016, or about one a day, according to an analysis of media reports. The high crime rate is attributable to Walmart's cost-cutting measures. Walmart has taken steps to ameliorate the problem, but critics say that effective action will require it to spend more on security and employees. In September 2016, employees at a McDonough, Georgia Walmart refused to make a police officer’s "Blue Lives Matter" retirement cake.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Former_stores_and_concepts">Former stores and concepts</span></h4>


<p>Walmart opened <b>"Supermercado de Walmart"</b> locations to appeal to <a href="/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans" title="Hispanic and Latino Americans">Hispanic</a> communities in the United States. The first one, a 39,000 square feet (3,600 square metres) store in the <a href="/wiki/Spring_Branch,_Houston" title="Spring Branch, Houston">Spring Branch</a> area of <a href="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, opened on April 29, 2009. The store was a conversion of an existing Walmart Neighborhood Market. The opening was Walmart's first entry in the Hispanic grocery market in Houston. In 2009, another Supermercado de Walmart opened in <a href="/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. Both the two Supermercado de Walmart locations have closed in 2014. In 2009, Walmart opened "Mas Club", a warehouse retail operation patterned after <a href="/wiki/Sam%27s_Club" title="Sam's Club">Sam's Club</a>. It closed its doors in 2014 with only one store.</p>
<p><b>Walmart Express</b> was a chain of smaller discount stores, with a range of services, from groceries to check cashing and gasoline service. The concept was focused on small towns deemed not able to support a larger store, and large cities where space was at a premium. Walmart planned to build 15 to 20 Walmart Express stores, focusing on Arkansas, North Carolina and Chicago, by the end of its fiscal year in January 2012. As of September 8, 2014, Walmart re-branded all of its Express format stores to Neighborhood Markets in an effort to streamline its retail offer. It continued to open new Express stores under the Neighborhood Market name. As of September 30, 2016, there were 34 small format stores in the United States. These include Amigo (19 locations), Walmart on Campus (14 locations), and the first and only Walmart To Go, a gas station/convenience store. As of January 15, 2016, Walmart announced that it will be closing 269 stores globally, including all 102 U.S. Walmart Express stores, including those branded as Neighborhood Markets.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Initiatives">Initiatives</span></h4>
<p>In September 2006, Walmart announced a pilot program to sell <a href="/wiki/Generic_drug" title="Generic drug">generic drugs</a> at <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$4</span><span class="nowrap"> </span>per prescription. The program was launched at stores in the <a href="/wiki/Tampa,_Florida" title="Tampa, Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, area, and by January 2007 had been expanded to all stores in Florida. While the average price of generics is<span class="nowrap"> </span><span style="white-space: nowrap">US$29</span> per prescription, compared to<span class="nowrap"> </span><span style="white-space: nowrap">US$102</span> for name-brand drugs, Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss, or providing them as an act of charity‍—‌instead, they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products. Many of Walmart's low cost generics are imported from India, where they are made by drug makers that include <a href="/wiki/Ranbaxy_Laboratories" title="Ranbaxy Laboratories">Ranbaxy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cipla" title="Cipla">Cipla</a>.</p>
<p>On February 6, 2007, the company launched a "beta" version of a movie download service, which sold about 3,000 films and television episodes from all major studios and television networks. The service was discontinued on December 21, 2007, due to low sales.</p>
<p>From 2008 through 2011, Walmart operated a pilot program in the small grocery store concept called <i>Marketside</i> in the metropolitan <a href="/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, area. The company plans to incorporate what it has learned from this concept into its Walmart Express stores.</p>
<p>In 2015, Walmart began testing a free grocery pickup service, allowing customers to select products online and choose their pickup time. At the store, a Walmart employee loads the groceries into the customer's car. As of September 2015, the program has expanded to 13 U.S. cities, and the company expects more stores to begin offering this service.</p>
<p>In May 2016, Walmart announced a change to ShippingPass, its three-day shipping service, and that it will move from a three-day delivery to two-day delivery to remain competitive with Amazon. Walmart priced it at 49 dollars per year, compared to Amazon Prime's 99 dollar per year price. If you are already a subscriber you get one month free.</p>
<p>In June 2016, Walmart and Sam's Club announced they will begin testing last-mile grocery delivery that uses services including <a href="/wiki/Uber_(company)" title="Uber (company)">Uber</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lyft" title="Lyft">Lyft</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deliv" title="Deliv">Deliv</a>, to bring customers' orders to their homes.

As of September 30, 2016, Walmart China (沃尔玛 <i>Wò'ērmǎ</i>) operates 423 stores under the Walmart Supercenter (388 locations), Sam's Club (13 locations), Neighborhood Market (2<span class="nowrap"> </span>locations), Smart Choice (1<span class="nowrap"> </span>location), and Trust-Mart Hypermarket (19 locations) banners. In Japan, Walmart owns 100 percent of <a href="/wiki/Seiyu_Group" title="Seiyu Group">Seiyu</a> (西友 <i>Seiyū</i>) as of 2008.

<p>In February 2012, Walmart announced that the company raises its stake to 51 percent in Chinese online supermarket <a href="/wiki/Yihaodian" title="Yihaodian">Yihaodian</a> to tap rising consumer wealth and help the company offer more products. Walmart took full ownership in July 2015. In November 2006, the company announced a joint venture with <a href="/wiki/Bharti_Enterprises" title="Bharti Enterprises">Bharti Enterprises</a> to operate in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. As foreign corporations were not allowed to enter the retail sector directly, Walmart operated through franchises and handled the wholesale end of the business. The partnership involves two joint ventures – Bharti manages the front end, involving opening of retail outlets, while Walmart takes care of the back end, such as <a href="/wiki/Cold_chain" title="Cold chain">cold chains</a> and logistics. Walmart operates stores in India under the name Best Price Modern Wholesale. The first store opened in <a href="/wiki/Amritsar" title="Amritsar">Amritsar</a> on 30 May 2009. On September 14, 2012, the Government of India approved 51 percent FDI in multi-brand retails, subject to approval by individual states, effective September 20, 2012. Scott Price, Walmart's president and CEO for Asia, told <a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a> that the company would be able to start opening Walmart stores in India within two years. Expansion into India faced some significant problems. In November 2012, Walmart admitted to spending <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$25<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> lobbying the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Congress" title="Indian National Congress">Indian National Congress</a>;‍—‌lobbying is conventionally considered bribery in India. Walmart is conducting an internal investigation into potential violations of the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act" title="Foreign Corrupt Practices Act">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a>. Bharti Walmart suspended a number of employees, rumored to include its CFO and legal team, to ensure "a complete and thorough investigation". As of September 30, 2016, there are 21 Best Price locations. In October 2013, Bharti and Walmart separated to pursue businesses independently.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Setbacks">Setbacks</span></h4>
<p>In the mid-1990s, Walmart tried with a large financial investment to get a foothold in the German retail market. In 1997, Walmart took over the supermarket chain Wertkauf with its 21 stores for DEM750<span class="nowrap"> </span>million and in 1998 Walmart acquired 74 Interspar stores for DEM1.3<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion.</p>
<p>The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among companies which used a similar low price strategy as Walmart. As a result, Walmart's low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage. Also, Walmart's <a href="/wiki/Organizational_culture" title="Organizational culture">corporate culture</a> was not viewed positively among employees and customers, particularly Walmart's "statement of ethics", which restricted relationships between employees and led to a public discussion in the media, resulting in a bad reputation among customers.</p>
<p>In July 2006, Walmart announced its withdrawal from Germany due to sustained losses. The stores were sold to the German company <a href="/wiki/Metro_AG" title="Metro AG">Metro</a> during Walmart's fiscal third quarter. Walmart did not disclose its losses from its German investment, but they were estimated to be around €3 billion.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Corruption_charges">Corruption charges</span></h4>
<p>An April 2012 investigative report by <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> reported the allegations of a former executive of Walmart de Mexico that, in September 2005, the company had paid <a href="/wiki/Bribery" title="Bribery">bribes</a> via local fixers to officials throughout Mexico in exchange for construction permits, information, and other favors, which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over competitors. Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken. Concerns were also raised that Walmart executives in the United States had "hushed up" the allegations. A follow-up investigation by <i>The New York Times,</i> published December 17, 2012, revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting, construction, and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery. There was evidence that a bribe of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$52,000</span> was paid to change a zoning map, which enabled the opening of a Walmart store a mile from a historical site in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Juan_Teotihuac%C3%A1n" title="San Juan Teotihuacán">San Juan Teotihuacán</a> in 2004. After the initial article was released, Walmart released a statement denying the allegations and describing its anti-corruption policy. While an official Walmart report states that it had found no evidence of corruption, the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public. <i><a href="/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a></i> contributor Adam Hartung also commented that the bribery scandal was a reflection of Walmart's "serious management and strategy troubles", stating, "[s]candals are now commonplace<span class="nowrap"> </span>... [e]ach scandal points out that Walmart's strategy is harder to navigate and is running into big problems".</p>
<p>As of December 2012, internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Walmart has invested <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$99<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> on internal investigations, which expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China, Brazil, and India. The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity, or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by "foreign financial and corporate interests".</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sam%27s_Club" title="Sam's Club">Sam's Club</a></div>

<p><b>Sam's Club</b> is a chain of <a href="/wiki/Warehouse_club" title="Warehouse club">warehouse clubs</a> that sell groceries and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_merchandise" title="General merchandise">general merchandise</a>, often in bulk. They range from 71,000 to 168,000 square feet (6,600 to 15,600 square metres), with an average size of 134,000 square feet (12,400 square metres). Sam's Clubs are membership warehouse clubs where most customers buy annual memberships. There are three kinds of memberships of Sam's Club: Sam's Plus, Sam's Business and Sam's Savings. Each of these memberships provides customers various benefits and convenience. However, non-members can make purchases either by buying a one-day membership or paying a surcharge based on the price of the purchase. Some locations also sell gasoline. The first Sam's Club opened in 1983 in <a href="/wiki/Midwest_City,_Oklahoma" title="Midwest City, Oklahoma">Midwest City, Oklahoma</a> under the name "Sam's Wholesale Club".</p>
<p>Sam's Club has found a niche market in recent years as a supplier to small businesses. All Sam's Clubs are open early hours exclusively for business members and their old slogan was "We're in Business for Small Business." Their slogan has been "Savings Made Simple" since late 2009, as Sam's Club attempts to attract a more diverse member base. In March 2009, the company announced that it plans to enter the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_medical_record" title="Electronic medical record">electronic medical records</a> business by offering a software package to physicians in small practices for <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$25,000</span>. Walmart is partnering with <a href="/wiki/Dell" title="Dell">Dell</a> and eClinicalWorks.com in this new venture.</p>
<p>Sam's Club's sales were <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$56.828<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>, or 11.9<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of total Walmart sales, during fiscal 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there were 655<span class="nowrap"> </span>Sam's Clubs in 47 states and Puerto Rico. Oregon, Rhode Island (which that state's only location closed in 2016), Vermont, and the District of Columbia are the only states and territories where a Sam's Club does not operate. Walmart, through Walmart International, also operates 200<span class="nowrap"> </span>international Sam's Clubs, including 160<span class="nowrap"> </span>in Mexico, 27<span class="nowrap"> </span>in <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and 13<span class="nowrap"> </span>in China.</p>

Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the U.S. and Canada and <a href="/wiki/Asda" title="Asda">Smart Price</a> in Britain. A 2006 study talked of "the magnitude of mind-share Walmart appears to hold in the shoppers' minds when it comes to the awareness of private label brands and retailers."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Corporate_affairs">Corporate affairs</span></h2>

<p>Walmart is headquartered in the Walmart Home Office complex in <a href="/wiki/Bentonville,_Arkansas" title="Bentonville, Arkansas">Bentonville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. The company's <a href="/wiki/Business_model" title="Business model">business model</a> is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices. Doug McMillon became Walmart's CEO on February 1, 2014. McMillon began his Walmart career in warehouses while in high school. He has also worked as the head of Sam's Club and Walmart International. The company refers to employees as "associates". All Walmart stores in the U.S. and Canada also have designated "greeters" at the entrance, a practice pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Sam_Walton" title="Sam Walton">Sam Walton</a> and later imitated by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions.</p>
<p>For many years, associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest, but this practice was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with khaki pants and polo shirts. The wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul to increase sales and rejuvenate the company's stock price. In September 2014 the uniform was again updated to bring back a vest (paid for by the company) for store employees over the same polo's and khaki or black pants paid for by the employee. The vest is navy blue for Walmart employees at Supercenters and discount stores and lime green for Walmart Neighborhood Market employees, both state "Proud Walmart Associate" on the left breast and the "Spark" logo covering the back. Reportedly one of the main reasons the vest was reintroduced was because some customers had trouble identifying employees. By requiring employees to wear uniforms that are made up of standard "street wear" Walmart is not required to purchase or reimbursement employees which is required in some states, as long as that clothing can be worn elsewhere. Businesses are only legally required to pay for branded shirts and pants or clothes that would be difficult to wear outside of work.</p>
<p>Unlike many other retailers, Walmart does not charge <a href="/wiki/Slotting_fee" title="Slotting fee">slotting fees</a> to suppliers for their products to appear in the store. Instead, it focuses on selling more popular products and provides incentives for store managers to drop unpopular products.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2006, the company announced that it would phase out its <a href="/wiki/Layaway" title="Layaway">layaway</a> program, citing declining use and increased costs. Layaway ceased on November 19, 2006, and required merchandise pickup by December 8, 2006. Walmart now focuses on other payment options, such as increased use of six- and twelve-month, zero-interest financing. The layaway location in most stores is now used for Walmart's Site-To-Store program, which was introduced in March 2007. This enables <i>walmart.com</i> customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option, and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Finance_and_governance">Finance and governance</span></h3>
<p>For the <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_year" title="Fiscal year">fiscal year</a> ending January 31, 2015, Walmart reported <a href="/wiki/Net_income" title="Net income">net income</a> of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$17<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> on <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$485.7<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> of revenue. The company's international operations accounted for <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$197.7<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>, or 40.7 percent, of sales.

<p>After Sam Walton's death in 1992, Don Soderquist, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice Chairman, became known as the "Keeper of the Culture."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Competition">Competition</span></h3>
<p>In North America, Walmart's primary competitors include <a href="/wiki/Department_store" title="Department store">department stores</a> like <a href="/wiki/Kmart" title="Kmart">Kmart</a>, <a href="/wiki/Publix" title="Publix">Publix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Target_Corporation" title="Target Corporation">Target</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shopko" title="Shopko">Shopko</a> and <a href="/wiki/Meijer" title="Meijer">Meijer</a>, Canada's The <a href="/wiki/Real_Canadian_Superstore" title="Real Canadian Superstore">Real Canadian Superstore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giant_Tiger" title="Giant Tiger">Giant Tiger</a>, and Mexico's <a href="/wiki/Comercial_Mexicana" title="Comercial Mexicana">Comercial Mexicana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soriana" title="Soriana">Soriana</a>. Competitors of Walmart's Sam's Club division are <a href="/wiki/Costco" title="Costco">Costco</a> and the smaller <a href="/wiki/BJ%27s_Wholesale_Club" title="BJ's Wholesale Club">BJ's Wholesale Club</a> chain. Walmart's move into the grocery business in the late 1990s also set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada. Some retail analysts see regional grocery store chain <a href="/wiki/WinCo_Foods" title="WinCo Foods">WinCo Foods</a> as serious competition for Walmart. Several smaller retailers, primarily <a href="/wiki/Variety_store" title="Variety store">dollar stores</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Family_Dollar" title="Family Dollar">Family Dollar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dollar_General" title="Dollar General">Dollar General</a>, have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Walmart. In 2004, Walmart responded by testing its own dollar store concept, a subsection of some stores called "Pennies-n-Cents."</p>
<p>Walmart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets. For example, in Germany it had captured just 2<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of the German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained "a secondary player" behind <a href="/wiki/Aldi" title="Aldi">Aldi</a> with 19<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent. Walmart continues to do well in the UK, where its <a href="/wiki/Asda" title="Asda">Asda</a> subsidiary is the second largest retailer.</p>
<p>In May 2006, after entering the South Korean market in 1998, Walmart sold all 16<span class="nowrap"> </span>of its South Korean outlets to <a href="/wiki/Shinsegae" title="Shinsegae">Shinsegae</a>, a local retailer, for <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$882<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span>. Shinsegae re-branded the Walmarts as <a href="/wiki/E-mart" title="E-mart">E-mart</a> stores.</p>
<p>Walmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas. In China, Walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens. For example, it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood; stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks, leading to higher sales.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Customer_base">Customer base</span></h3>

<p>Walmart customers cite low prices as the most important reason for shopping there. The average U.S. Walmart customer's income is below the national average, and analysts estimated that more than one-fifth of them lack a bank account; twice the national rate. A 2006 Walmart report also indicated that Walmart customers are sensitive to higher utility costs and gas prices. A poll indicated that after the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004" title="United States presidential election, 2004">2004 US Presidential Election</a>, 76<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of voters who shopped at Walmart once a week voted for <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, while only 23 percent supported senator <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>. When measured against similar retailers in the U.S., frequent Walmart shoppers were rated the most politically <a href="/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="Conservatism in the United States">conservative</a>. Thus, as of 2014, the "majority (54<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent) [of] Americans who prefer shopping at Walmart report that they oppose <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a>, while 40 percent are in favor of it."</p>
<p>Due to its prominence in the <a href="/wiki/Bible_Belt" title="Bible Belt">Bible Belt</a>, Walmart is known for its "tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers". Walmart only carries <a href="/wiki/Censorship_of_music" title="Censorship of music">clean versions</a> of hip-hop <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compact_Disc" title="Compact Disc">audio CDs</a> and in cooperation with <a href="/wiki/The_Timothy_Plan" title="The Timothy Plan">The Timothy Plan</a>, places "plastic sheathes over suggestive women's periodicals and banned 'lad mags' such as <a href="/wiki/Maxim_(magazine)" title="Maxim (magazine)">Maxim</a>" magazine. In addition, Walmart also caters to its Christian customer base by selling <a href="/wiki/Christian_media" title="Christian media">Christian books and media</a>, "such as <a href="/wiki/VeggieTales" title="VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a> videos and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Purpose-Driven_Life" title="The Purpose-Driven Life">The Purpose-Driven Life</a>", which earns the company over <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$1<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> annually.</p>
<p>In 2006, Walmart took steps to expand its U.S. customer base, announcing a modification in its U.S. stores from a "one-size-fits-all" merchandising strategy to one designed to "reflect each of six demographic groups – African-Americans, the affluent, empty-nesters, Hispanics, suburbanites and rural residents." Around six months later, it unveiled a new slogan: <i>"Saving people money so they can live better lives"</i>. This reflects the three main groups into which Walmart categorizes its 200<span class="nowrap"> </span>million customers: "brand aspirationals" (people with low incomes who are obsessed with names like <a href="/wiki/KitchenAid" title="KitchenAid">KitchenAid</a>), "price-sensitive affluents" (wealthier shoppers who love deals), and "value-price shoppers" (people who like low prices and cannot afford much more). Walmart has also made steps to appeal to more <a href="/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="Liberalism in the United States">liberal</a> customers, for example, by rejecting the <a href="/wiki/American_Family_Association" title="American Family Association">American Family Association</a>'s recommendations and carrying the DVD <i><a href="/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a>,</i> a love story between two gay cowboys in Wyoming.</p>

<p>Sam Walton believed that the company's contribution to society was the fact that it operated efficiently, thereby lowering the <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_living" title="Cost of living">cost of living</a> for customers, and therefore in that sense was a "powerful force for good", despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes. Having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a "handout", he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education, they could not be expected to "solve every personal problem that comes to [their] attention". He explained later in his autobiography, "We feel very strongly that Wal-Mart really is <i>not</i>, and <i>should not</i> be, in the charity business," stating "any debit has to be passed along to somebody‍—‌either shareholders or our customers." Since Sam Walton's death in 1992, however, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation dramatically increased charitable giving. For example, in 2005, Walmart donated <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$20<span class="nowrap"> </span>million</span> in cash and merchandise for <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> relief. Today, Walmart's charitable donations approach <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$1<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> each year.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_impact">Economic impact</span></h2>
<p>Kenneth Stone, Professor of Economics at <a href="/wiki/Iowa_State_University" title="Iowa State University">Iowa State University</a>, in a paper published in <i>Farm Foundation</i> in 1997, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening. He compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past‍—‌from the development of the railroads and the Sears Roebuck catalog to shopping malls. He concludes that small towns are more affected by "discount mass merchandiser stores" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever changing retail market can "co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment."</p>
<p>One study found Walmart's entry into a new market has a profound impact on its competition. When a Walmart opens in a new market, median sales drop 40 percent at similar high-volume stores, 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at <a href="/wiki/Pharmacy" title="Pharmacy">drugstores</a>, according to a June 2009 study by researchers at several universities and led by the Tuck School of Business at <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Loyola_University_Chicago" title="Loyola University Chicago">Loyola University Chicago</a> study suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store. The leader of that study admits that this factor is stronger in smaller towns and doesn't apply to more urban areas saying "It'd be so tough to nail down what's up with Wal-Mart". These findings are underscored by another study conducted in 2009 by the National Bureau of <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">Economics</a> that showed "large, negative effects" for competing businesses within five to ten <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miles" title="Miles">miles</a> of the new opening big box retailer. This same study also found that the local retailers experience virtually no benefit. This particularly contrasts with studies that find that local firms re-invest nearly 63% more of <a href="/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" title="Profit (accounting)">profits</a> in other local businesses compared to chain retailers, as found by the <a href="/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a> Center of Economic Policy in 2011.</p>
<p>Walmart has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_union" title="Labor union">labor unions</a>, community groups, <a href="/wiki/Grassroots" title="Grassroots">grassroots</a> organizations, religious organizations, environmental groups, and the company's own customers and employees. They have protested against the company's policies and business practices, including charges of racial and gender discrimination. Other areas of criticism include the company's foreign product sourcing, treatment of suppliers, employee compensation and working conditions, environmental practices, <a href="/wiki/Corporate_welfare" title="Corporate welfare">the use of public subsidies</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_spies#Wal-Mart_surveillance_of_employees" title="Labor spies">the company's security policies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. Walmart denies doing anything wrong and maintains that low prices are the result of efficiency.</p>

<li>A 2001 <a href="/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company" title="McKinsey &amp; Company">McKinsey</a> Global Institute study of U.S. labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 concluded that "Wal-Mart directly and indirectly caused the bulk of the productivity acceleration" in the retail sector. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Solow" title="Robert Solow">Robert Solow</a>, a Nobel laureate in economics and an adviser to the study, stated that "[b]y far the most important factor in that [growth] is Wal-Mart."</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Economic_Policy_Institute" title="Economic Policy Institute">Economic Policy Institute</a> estimates that between 2001 and 2006, Wal-Mart's trade deficit with China alone eliminated nearly 200,000 U.S. jobs. Another study at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Missouri" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a> found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by 100 jobs in the short term, half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close.</li>
<li>A 2004 paper by two professors at <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University" title="Pennsylvania State University">Pennsylvania State University</a> found that U.S. counties with Walmart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without Wal-Marts. They hypothesized that this could be due to the displacement of workers from higher-paid jobs in the retailers customers no longer choose to patronize, Wal-Mart providing less local charity than the replaced businesses, or a shrinking pool of local leadership and reduced <a href="/wiki/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a> due to a reduced number of local independent businesses. Dr <a href="/wiki/Raj_Patel" title="Raj Patel">Raj Patel</a>, author of "<a href="/wiki/Stuffed_and_Starved" title="Stuffed and Starved">Stuffed and Starved</a>: Markets, Power and the Hidden Battle for the World Food System", said in a lecture at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Melbourne" title="University of Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> on September 18, 2007, that a study in Nebraska looked at two different Wal-Marts, the first of which had just arrived and "was in the process of driving everyone else out of business but, to do that, they cut their prices to the bone, very, very low prices". In the other Wal-Mart, "they had successfully destroyed the local economy, there was a sort of economic crater with Wal-Mart in the middle; and, in that community, the prices were 17<span class="nowrap"> </span> percent higher".</li>
<li>A 2005 story in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> reported that "Wal-Mart's discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of American shoppers by at least <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$50<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> per year." A study in 2005 at the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) measured the effect on <a href="/wiki/Welfare_economics" title="Welfare economics">consumer welfare</a> and found that the poorest segment of the population benefits the most from the existence of discount retailers.</li>
<li>A June 2006 article published by the <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises_Institute" title="Ludwig von Mises Institute">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a> suggested that Wal-Mart has a positive impact on small business. It argued that while Wal-Mart's low prices caused some existing businesses to close, the chain also created new opportunities for other small business, and so "the process of <a href="/wiki/Creative_destruction" title="Creative destruction">creative destruction</a> unleashed by Wal-Mart has no statistically significant impact on the overall size of the small business sector in the United States."</li>
<li>In 2006, American newspaper columnist <a href="/wiki/George_Will" title="George Will">George Will</a> named Wal-Mart "the most prodigious job-creator in the history of the private sector in this galaxy" and that "[b]y lowering consumer prices, Wal-Mart costs about 50 retail jobs among competitors <i>for every 100 jobs Wal-Mart creates</i>". In terms of economic effects, Will states that "Wal-Mart and its effects save shoppers more than <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$200<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> a year, dwarfing such government programs as <a href="/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program" title="Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program">food stamps</a> (<span style="white-space: nowrap">US$28.6<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>) and the <a href="/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit" title="Earned income tax credit">earned income tax credit</a> <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$34.6<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span>)".</li>
<li>A 2014 story in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> reported that the Wal-Mart Foundation was boosting its efforts to work with U.S. manufacturers. In February 2014, the Walmart Foundation pledged <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$10<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> to support domestic manufacturers and announced plans to buy <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$250<span class="nowrap"> </span>billion</span> worth of American-made products in the next decade.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Labor_relations">Labor relations</span></h2>

<p>With over 2.2 million employees worldwide, Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve <a href="/wiki/Wage" title="Wage">low wages</a>, <a href="/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health" title="Occupational safety and health">poor working conditions</a>, inadequate <a href="/wiki/Health_care" title="Health care">health care</a>, as well as issues involving the company's strong <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">anti-union</a> policies. In November 2013 the <a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board" title="National Labor Relations Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) announced that it had found that in 13<span class="nowrap"> </span>U.S. states Wal-Mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday, and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes. Critics point to Walmart's high <a href="/wiki/Turnover_(employment)" title="Turnover (employment)">turnover</a> rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved. Approximately 70<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of its employees leave within the first year. Despite this turnover rate, the company is still able to affect unemployment rates. This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states, "Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present, but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account."</p>
<p>Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States, employing almost five times as many people as <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>, the second largest employer. Walmart employs more <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> than any other private employer in the United States.</p>
<p>On February 23, 2015, Walmart announced that it is bumping its minimum wage to <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$10</span><span class="nowrap"> </span>an<span class="nowrap"> </span>hour by February 2016.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gender_and_sexual_orientation">Gender and sexual orientation</span></h3>
<p>In 2007, a <a href="/wiki/Discrimination" title="Discrimination">gender discrimination</a> lawsuit, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dukes_v._Wal-Mart_Stores,_Inc." title="Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.">Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</a></i>, was filed against Walmart, alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions. A <a href="/wiki/Class_action" title="Class action">class action</a> suit was sought, which would have been the nation's largest in history, covering 1.5<span class="nowrap"> </span>million past and current employees. On June 20, 2011, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">United States Supreme Court</a> ruled in Wal-Mart's favor, stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class. The court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs' circumstances, the class action could not proceed as presented, and furthermore, in a 5–4 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit. Several plaintiffs, including the lead plaintiff, Betty Dukes, expressed their intent to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately.</p>
<p>According to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit, in 2001, Wal-Mart's EEOC filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly paid workforce, but only 33<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of its management. Just 35<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of its store managers were women, compared to 57 percent at similar retailers. Wal-Mart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair, because it classifies employees differently; if department managers were included in the totals, women would make up 60<span class="nowrap"> </span>percent of the managerial ranks. Others have criticized the lawsuit as without basis in the law and as an abuse of the class action mechanism. In 2007, Wal-Mart was named by the National Association for Female Executives as one of the top<span class="nowrap"> </span>35 companies for Executive Women.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart's rating on the <a href="/wiki/Human_Rights_Campaign" title="Human Rights Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Corporate_Equality_Index" title="Corporate Equality Index">Corporate Equality Index</a>, a measure of how companies treat <a href="/wiki/LGBT" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> employees and customers, has increased greatly during the past decade. The company was praised for expanding its anti-discrimination policy protecting gay and lesbian employees, as well as for a new definition of "family" that included same-sex partners. However, they have been criticized by the HRC in other areas, such as not renewing its membership in the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>In January 2006, Wal-Mart announced that "diversity efforts include new groups of minority, female and gay employees that meet at Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion. There are seven Business Resource Groups: women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, Gays and Lesbians, and a disabled group."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Animal_welfare">Animal welfare</span></h2>
<p>In April 2016, Walmart announced that it plans to eliminate eggs from <a href="/wiki/Battery_cage" title="Battery cage">battery cages</a> from its supply chain by 2025. The decision was particularly important because of Walmart's large <a href="/wiki/Market_share" title="Market share">market share</a> and influence on the rest of the industry. The move was praised by major <a href="/wiki/Animal_welfare" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a> groups and heralded as an "end of an era" by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States" title="Humane Society of the United States">HSUS</a> president <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Pacelle" title="Wayne Pacelle">Wayne Pacelle</a>, but a poultry trade group representative expressed skepticism about the decision's impact. Walmart's cage-free eggs will not come from <a href="/wiki/Free_range" title="Free range">free range</a> producers, but rather <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Factory_farming" title="Factory farming">industrial-scale farms</a> where the birds will be alotted between 1 and 1.5 square feet each, a stressful arrangement which can cause <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism_in_poultry" title="Cannibalism in poultry">cannibalism</a>. Unlike battery cages, the systems Walmart's suppliers will use allow the hens to move around, but relative to battery cages they have higher hen mortality rates and present distinct environmental and worker health problems.</p>
