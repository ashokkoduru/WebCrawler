<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Morrill_Act" title="Morrill Act">Morrill Act</a> of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the <b><a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire_College_of_Agriculture_and_the_Mechanic_Arts" title="New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts">New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts</a></b> in <a href="/wiki/Hanover,_New_Hampshire" title="Hanover, New Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, in association with <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Thompson_(farmer)" title="Benjamin Thompson (farmer)">Benjamin Thompson</a> left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891 Gov. Hiram Americus Tuttle signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Gov. Tuttle signed a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law)" title="Bill (proposed law)">bill</a> authorizing the college's move to <a href="/wiki/Durham,_New_Hampshire" title="Durham, New Hampshire">Durham, New Hampshire</a>.</p>
<p>In 1892, the Board of Trustees hired <a href="/wiki/Charles_Eliot_(landscape_architect)" title="Charles Eliot (landscape architect)">Charles Eliot</a> to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to "authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham." The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished <a href="/wiki/Thompson_Hall_(University_of_New_Hampshire)" title="Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)">Thompson Hall</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Romanesque_Revival" title="Romanesque Revival">Romanesque Revival</a> campus centerpiece designed by the prominent <a href="/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire" title="Concord, New Hampshire">Concord</a> architectural firm of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Dow_(architect)" title="Edward Dow (architect)">Dow &amp; Randlett</a>.</p>
<p>In fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_year" title="First year">freshmen</a> and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greek_system" title="Greek system">Greek system</a>. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.</p>
<p>In 1923, Gov. Fred Herbert Brown signed a bill changing the name of the college to <b>University of New Hampshire</b>.</p>

<p>In the 2006 academic year the university cut women's crew, men's swimming &amp; diving, and men's and women's tennis at the varsity level, and trimmed the size of the men's ski team from 27 to 12.

<p>The University of New Hampshire is located in the town of <a href="/wiki/Durham,_New_Hampshire" title="Durham, New Hampshire">Durham</a>, and is a "traditional New England campus." The Durham campus is 1,100 acres (4.5 km), with 300 acres (1.2 km) in the "campus core" and 800 acres (3.2 km) of open land on the west edge of campus. The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of 2,600 acres (11 km) of land.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Housing">Housing</span></h3>



<p>The university offers all underclassmen the opportunity to live in university housing. As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.</p>
<p>The university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.</p>
<p>Undergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president <a href="/wiki/Ralph_D._Hetzel" title="Ralph D. Hetzel">Ralph D. Hetzel</a>. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.</p>
<p>For the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables ("North" and "South") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A &amp; B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.</p>
<p>Due to the over-enrollment of the 2006–2007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH "Dining Dollars" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.</p>
<p>Stoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.</p>
<p>In 2015, UNH installed life-saving <a href="/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator" title="Automated external defibrillator">automated external defibrillators</a> in two fraternity houses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Themed_housing">Themed housing</span></h3>
<p>The University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality. Common themes include: first year, leadership, green living, multi-cultural, honors, chem-free, and the arts.</p>
<p>Housing is guaranteed to all new first-year students, with many of them housed in Christensen Hall and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Williamson_Hall&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Williamson Hall (page does not exist)">Williamson Hall</a>, the two largest first-year-only halls. Alexander Hall is also an all first-year student hall, specifically for students in the College of Liberal Arts who have not declared a major yet. These halls offer a living environment of commonality, where all are new to the university. The university guarantees students who live on-campus the ability to live on campus all four years. However, students who move off campus (with the exception of students studying abroad) lose this guarantee, and must complete a housing wait-list application each semester in order to be considered for on-campus housing the following semester.</p>
<p>Transfer students can generally get on campus housing if transferring to UNH for the spring semester (but must submit a completed housing wait-list application prior to transferring); however, transfer students transferring for the fall semester have a relatively low chance of getting on campus housing due to the high demand of returning students, and the incoming freshman class. Transfer students are also not guaranteed housing, unless transferring from a community college after graduating with their associates.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainability">Sustainability</span></h3>
<p>With the UNH Sustainability Institute, UNH possesses the oldest endowed <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a> program in higher education in the U.S. and has been integrating sustainability across the university's curriculum, operations, research and engagement since the office was founded in 1997. Examples of efforts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual major available in <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a></li>
<li>Dual major available in EcoGastronomy</li>
<li>The first organic dairy research farm at a US land grant university</li>
<li>EcoLine (a <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a> pipeline) that meets up to 85% of the university's energy needs (while selling REC's off the electricity generated to invest back in the EcoLine project and a revolving energy efficiency fund)</li>
<li>WildCAP, UNH's Climate Action Plan, with goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2020 and 80% by 2050 (compared to a 1990 baseline)</li>
<li>Energy and Ecosystem Task Forces</li>
<li>Signature of the international <a href="/wiki/Slow_Food" title="Slow Food">Slow Food</a> principles, the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, and the Taillories Declaration</li>
<li>~22% of dining hall purchases coming from local, regional and organic sources</li>
<li>Engaged scholarship for sustainability through programs like Carbon Solutions New England, Food Solutions New England, the Sustainability Research Collaboratory, and more</li>
<li>NH Farm to School Program</li>
</ul>
<p>UNH has received numerous awards and "top ten" recognition for its sustainability leadership, including from AASHE, the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the Princeton Review, the Sierra Club, <i>KIWI Magazine</i>, <i>Business NH Magazine</i>, the USEPA, and the USDOT.</p>
<p>UNH released a book about its sustainability efforts in 2009, titled <i>The Sustainable Learning Community: One University's Journey to the Future</i>. Coauthored by over 60 faculty, staff and community partners, it is one of the first to focus on a higher education institute's entire suite of integrated sustainability efforts. The text cites university efforts to integrate sustainable behavior within its own educational structure, encouraging a critical outlook on local and global sustainability practices.</p>
