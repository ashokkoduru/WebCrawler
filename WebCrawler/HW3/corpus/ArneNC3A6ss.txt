<p><b>Arne Dekke Eide Næss</b> (<span title="English pronunciation respelling"><a href="/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key" title="Help:Pronunciation respelling key"><i><b><span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">AR</span></span></b>-nə</i></a></span> <span title="English pronunciation respelling"><a href="/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key" title="Help:Pronunciation respelling key"><i><b><span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">NASS</span></span></b></i></a></span>; 27 January 1912 – 12 January 2009) was a Norwegian philosopher who coined the term "<a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecology</a>" and was an important intellectual and inspirational figure within the <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmental movement</a> of the late twentieth century. Næss cited <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s 1962 book <i><a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a></i> as being a key influence in his vision of deep ecology. Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian <a href="/wiki/Nonviolence" title="Nonviolence">nonviolence</a> and on several occasions participated in <a href="/wiki/Direct_action" title="Direct action">direct action</a>.</p>
<p>Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early <a href="/wiki/Post-war" title="Post-war">post-war</a> period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time, they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems. Naess believed that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_crisis" title="Environmental crisis">environmental crisis</a> of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged.</p>
<p>He thereby distinguished between what he called <i>deep</i> and <i>shallow</i> ecological thinking. In contrast to the prevailing utilitarian pragmatism of western businesses and governments he advocated that a true understanding of nature would give rise to a point of view that appreciates the value of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_diversity" title="Biological diversity">biological diversity</a>, understanding that each living thing is dependent on the existence of other creatures in the complex web of interrelationships that is the natural world.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Life_and_career">Life and career</span></h2>
<p>Næss was born in Slemdal, Oslo, Norway, the son of Christine (Dekke) and Ragnar Eide Næss. In 1939, Næss was the youngest person to be appointed full professor at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oslo" title="University of Oslo">University of Oslo</a> and the only professor of philosophy in the country at the time. He was a noted mountaineer, who in 1950 led the expedition that made the first ascent of <a href="/wiki/Tirich_Mir" title="Tirich Mir">Tirich Mir</a> (7,708 m). The Tvergastein hut in the <a href="/wiki/Hallingskarvet" title="Hallingskarvet">Hallingskarvet</a> massif played an important role in Ecosophy T, as "T" is said to represent his mountain hut Tvergastein. In 1958, he founded the interdisciplinary journal of philosophy <i><a href="/wiki/Inquiry:_An_Interdisciplinary_Journal_of_Philosophy" title="Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy">Inquiry</a></i>.</p>

<p>In 1970, together with a large number of protesters, he chained himself to rocks in front of <a href="/wiki/Mardalsfossen" title="Mardalsfossen">Mardalsfossen</a>, a waterfall in a Norwegian <a href="/wiki/Fjord" title="Fjord">fjord</a>, and refused to descend until plans to build a dam were dropped. Though the demonstrators were carried away by police and the dam was eventually built, the demonstration launched a more activist phase of Norwegian environmentalism.</p>
<p>In 1996, he won the <a href="/wiki/Swedish_Academy_Nordic_Prize" title="Swedish Academy Nordic Prize">Swedish Academy Nordic Prize</a>, known as the 'little Nobel'. In 2005 he was decorated as a Commander with Star of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Norwegian_Order_of_St._Olav" title="Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav">Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav</a> for socially useful work. Næss was a minor political candidate for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Milj%C3%B8partiet_De_Gr%C3%B8nne" title="Miljøpartiet De Grønne">Norwegian Green Party</a> in 2005.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy">Philosophy</span></h2>
<p>Næss' <i><a href="/wiki/Erkenntnis_und_wissenschaftliches_Verhalten" title="Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten">Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten</a></i> (1936) anticipated many themes familiar in post-war analytic philosophy. Næss' main philosophical work from the 1950s was entitled "Interpretation and Preciseness". This was an application of <a href="/wiki/Set_theory" title="Set theory">set theory</a> to the problems of language interpretation, extending the work of semanticists such as <a href="/wiki/Charles_Kay_Ogden" title="Charles Kay Ogden">Charles Kay Ogden</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Meaning_of_Meaning" title="The Meaning of Meaning">The Meaning of Meaning</a></i>. A simple way of explaining it is that any given utterance (word, phrase, or sentence) can be considered as having different potential interpretations, depending on prevailing language norms, the characteristics of particular persons or groups of users, and the language situation in which the utterance occurred. These differing interpretations are to be formulated in more precise language represented as subsets of the original utterance. Each subset can, in its turn, have further subsets (theoretically ad infinitum). The advantages of this conceptualisation of interpretation are various. It enables systematic demonstration of possible interpretation, making possible evaluation of which are the more and less "reasonable interpretations". It is a logical instrument for demonstrating language vagueness, undue generalisation, conflation, pseudo-agreement and effective communication.</p>
<p>Næss developed a simplified, practical textbook embodying these advantages, entitled <i>Communication and Argument</i>, which became a valued introduction to this pragmatics or "language logic", and was used over many decades as a <i><a href="/wiki/Sine_qua_non" title="Sine qua non">sine qua non</a></i> for the preparatory examination at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oslo" title="University of Oslo">University of Oslo</a>, later known as "Examen Philosophicum" ("Exphil").</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_public_debate">Recommendations for public debate</span></h3>
<p><i>Communication and Argument</i> included his recommendations for objective public debate. Næss argued for adhering to the following rules to make discussions as fruitful and pleasant as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Avoid tendentious irrelevance</b><br/>
Examples: Personal attacks, claims of opponents' motivation, explaining reasons for an argument.</li>
<li><b>Avoid tendentious quoting</b><br/>
Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate.</li>
<li><b>Avoid tendentious ambiguity</b><br/>
Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism.</li>
<li><b>Avoid tendentious use of <a href="/wiki/Straw_man" title="Straw man">straw men</a></b><br/>
Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold.</li>
<li><b>Avoid tendentious statements of fact</b><br/>
Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete, and one should not withhold relevant information.</li>
<li><b>Avoid tendentious tone of presentation</b><br/>
Examples: irony, sarcasm, pejoratives, exaggeration, subtle (or open) threats.</li>
</ol>
<p>For many years these points were part of two compulsory courses in <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> taught in Norwegian universities ("Examen philosophicum" and "Examen facultatum").</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecosophy_T">Ecosophy T</span></h3>
<p><b>Ecosophy T</b>, as distinct from deep ecology, was originally the name of his personal philosophy. Others such as <a href="/wiki/Warwick_Fox" title="Warwick Fox">Warwick Fox</a> have interpreted deep ecology as a commitment to <a href="/wiki/Ecosophy" title="Ecosophy">ecosophy</a> T, Næss's personal beliefs. The T referred to Tvergastein, a mountain hut where he wrote many of his books, and reflected Næss's view that everyone should develop his own philosophy.</p>
<p>Although a very rich and complex philosophy, Næss's <a href="/wiki/Ecosophy" title="Ecosophy">ecosophy</a> can be summed up as having Self-realization as its core. According to Næss, every being, whether <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a>, <a href="/wiki/Animal" title="Animal">animal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetable</a> has an equal right to live and to blossom. Through this capitalized Self, Næss emphasizes, in distinction to realization of man’s narrow selves, the realization of our selves as part of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_spheres" title="Earth's spheres">ecospheric</a> whole. It is in this whole that our true ecological Self can be realized. Practically Self-realization for Næss means that, if one does not know how the outcomes of one's actions will affect other beings, one should not act, similar to the <a href="/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> <a href="/wiki/Harm_principle" title="Harm principle">harm principle</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Family">Family</span></h2>
<p>Næss' father, Ragnar Næss, was a successful banker and Næss was the younger brother of shipowner <a href="/wiki/Erling_Dekke_N%C3%A6ss" title="Erling Dekke Næss">Erling Dekke Næss</a>. Næss himself was a married father of two and was the uncle of mountaineer and businessman <a href="/wiki/Arne_N%C3%A6ss_Jr." title="Arne Næss Jr.">Arne Næss Jr.</a> (1937–2004), who was once married to <a href="/wiki/Diana_Ross" title="Diana Ross">Diana Ross</a>.</p>
