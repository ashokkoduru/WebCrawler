<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Although chemicals were made and used throughout history, the birth of the heavy chemical industry (production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses) coincided with the beginnings of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in general.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</span></h3>
<p>One of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial process was <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a>. In 1736, the pharmacist <a href="/wiki/Joshua_Ward" title="Joshua Ward">Joshua Ward</a> developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter, allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water. It was the first practical production of sulfuric acid on a large scale. <a href="/wiki/John_Roebuck" title="John Roebuck">John Roebuck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Garbett" title="Samuel Garbett">Samuel Garbett</a> were the first to establish a large-scale factory in <a href="/wiki/Prestonpans" title="Prestonpans">Prestonpans, Scotland</a>, in 1749, which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid.</p>

<p>In the early 18th century, cloth was bleached by treating it with stale <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sour_milk" title="Sour milk">sour milk</a> and exposing it to <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production. Sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as <a href="/wiki/Lime_(material)" title="Lime (material)">lime</a> by the middle of the century, but it was the discovery of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bleaching_powder" title="Bleaching powder">bleaching powder</a> by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Tennant" title="Charles Tennant">Charles Tennant</a> that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise. His powder was made by reacting <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> with dry <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slaked_lime" title="Slaked lime">slaked lime</a> and proved to be a cheap and successful product. He opened a factory in <a href="/wiki/Glasgow_St_Rollox_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Glasgow St Rollox (UK Parliament constituency)">St Rollox</a>, north of <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soda_ash" title="Soda ash">Soda ash</a> was used since ancient times in the production of <a href="/wiki/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Textile" title="Textile">textile</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soap" title="Soap">soap</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>, and the source of the <a href="/wiki/Potash" title="Potash">potash</a> had traditionally been <a href="/wiki/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a> ashes in <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>. By the 18th century, this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation, and the <a href="/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences" title="French Academy of Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a> offered a prize of 2400 <a href="/wiki/French_livre" title="French livre">livres</a> for a method to produce alkali from sea salt (<a href="/wiki/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">sodium chloride</a>). The <a href="/wiki/Leblanc_process" title="Leblanc process">Leblanc process</a> was patented in 1791 by <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Leblanc" title="Nicolas Leblanc">Nicolas Leblanc</a> who then built a Leblanc plant at <a href="/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis" title="Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis">Saint-Denis</a>. He was denied his prize money because of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process really took off. <a href="/wiki/William_Losh" title="William Losh">William Losh</a> built the first soda works in Britain at the <a href="/wiki/Losh,_Wilson_and_Bell" title="Losh, Wilson and Bell">Losh, Wilson and Bell</a> works on the <a href="/wiki/River_Tyne" title="River Tyne">River Tyne</a> in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large <a href="/wiki/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. <a href="/wiki/James_Muspratt" title="James Muspratt">James Muspratt</a>'s chemical works in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and Charles Tennant's complex near <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.</p>

<p>These huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> matured. Originally, large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda, provoking one of the <a href="/wiki/Alkali_Act_1863" title="Alkali Act 1863">first pieces of environmental legislation</a> to be passed in 1863. This provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution. Methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Solvay_process" title="Solvay process">Solvay process</a> was developed by the <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> industrial chemist <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Solvay" title="Ernest Solvay">Ernest Solvay</a> in 1861. In 1864, Solvay and his brother Alfred constructed a plant in the Belgian town of <a href="/wiki/Charleroi" title="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> and in 1874, they expanded into a larger plant in <a href="/wiki/Nancy,_France" title="Nancy, France">Nancy</a>, France. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In the same year, <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Mond" title="Ludwig Mond">Ludwig Mond</a> visited Solvay to acquire the rights to use his process, and he and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Tomlinson_Brunner" title="John Tomlinson Brunner">John Brunner</a> formed the firm of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brunner_Mond" title="Brunner Mond">Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.</a>, and built a Solvay plant at <a href="/wiki/Winnington" title="Winnington">Winnington</a>, England. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success; he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Expansion_and_maturation">Expansion and maturation</span></h3>
<p>The late 19th century saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured. Large chemical industries also took shape in Germany and later in the United States.</p>

<p>Production of artificial manufactured <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a> for <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> was pioneered by Sir <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Lawes" title="John Lawes">John Lawes</a> at his purpose-built <a href="/wiki/Rothamsted_Research" title="Rothamsted Research">Rothamsted Research</a> facility. In the 1840s he established large works near <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> for the manufacture of <a href="/wiki/Monocalcium_phosphate" title="Monocalcium phosphate">superphosphate of lime</a>. Processes for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vulcanization_of_rubber" title="Vulcanization of rubber">vulcanization of rubber</a> were patented by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Goodyear" title="Charles Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a> in the United States and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hancock_(inventor)" title="Thomas Hancock (inventor)">Thomas Hancock</a> in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Perkin" title="William Henry Perkin">William Henry Perkin</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. He partly transformed <a href="/wiki/Aniline" title="Aniline">aniline</a> into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms <a href="/wiki/BASF" title="BASF">BASF</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bayer_AG" title="Bayer AG">Bayer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hoechst_AG" title="Hoechst AG">Hoechst</a> produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad. In the United States, <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Henry_Dow" title="Herbert Henry Dow">Herbert Henry Dow's</a> use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from <a href="/wiki/Brine" title="Brine">brine</a> was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> industry can be traced back to the oil works of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Young_(Scottish_chemist)" title="James Young (Scottish chemist)">James Young</a> in Scotland and <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Pineo_Gesner" title="Abraham Pineo Gesner">Abraham Pineo Gesner</a> in Canada. The first plastic was invented by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Parkes" title="Alexander Parkes">Alexander Parkes</a>, an English <a href="/wiki/Metallurgy" title="Metallurgy">metallurgist</a>. In 1856, he patented <a href="/wiki/Parkesine" title="Parkesine">Parkesine</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Celluloid" title="Celluloid">celluloid</a> based on <a href="/wiki/Nitrocellulose" title="Nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a> treated with a variety of solvents. This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The industrial production of <a href="/wiki/Soap" title="Soap">soap</a> from vegetable oils was started by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_Lever" title="William Lever">William Lever</a> and his brother <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Darcy_Lever" title="James Darcy Lever">James</a> in 1885 in <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glycerin" title="Glycerin">glycerin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oils</a>.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, chemical firms consolidated into large <a href="/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)" title="Conglomerate (company)">conglomerates</a>; <a href="/wiki/IG_Farben" title="IG Farben">IG Farben</a> in Germany, <a href="/wiki/Rh%C3%B4ne-Poulenc" title="Rhône-Poulenc">Rhône-Poulenc</a> in France and <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Chemical_Industries" title="Imperial Chemical Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> in Britain. <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">Dupont</a> became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in America.</p>
<p>Currently chemical production is a high-tech industry, where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Products">Products</span></h2>
<p>Polymers and plastics, especially <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" title="Polyethylene">polyethylene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polypropylene" title="Polypropylene">polypropylene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate" title="Polyethylene terephthalate">polyethylene terephthalate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" title="Polystyrene">polystyrene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polycarbonate" title="Polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a> comprise about 80% of the industry’s output worldwide. These materials are often converted to <a href="/wiki/Fluoropolymer" title="Fluoropolymer">fluoropolymer</a> tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials. Chemicals are used to make a wide variety of consumer goods, as well as thousands of inputs to agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and service industries. The chemical industry itself consumes 26 percent of its own output. Major industrial customers include rubber and <a href="/wiki/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> products, <a href="/wiki/Textile" title="Textile">textiles</a>, apparel, petroleum refining, <a href="/wiki/Paper_chemicals" title="Paper chemicals">pulp and paper</a>, and primary metals. Chemicals are nearly a $3 trillion global enterprise, and the EU and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.</p>
<p>Sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories, including basic chemicals (about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output), life sciences (30 percent), specialty chemicals (20 to 25 percent) and consumer products (about 10 percent).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_chemicals_.26_Commodity_Chemicals_to_Polymers_and_Speciality_Chemicals">Basic chemicals &amp; Commodity Chemicals to Polymers and Speciality Chemicals</span></h3>

<p>Basic chemicals, or "commodity chemicals" are a broad chemical category including polymers, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, <a href="/wiki/Inorganic_chemistry" title="Inorganic chemistry">inorganic chemicals</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>. Typical growth rates for basic chemicals are about 0.5 to 0.7 times GDP. Product prices are generally less than fifty cents per pound.</p>
<p><b>Polymers</b>, the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value, includes all categories of <a href="/wiki/Plastics_industry" title="Plastics industry">plastics</a> and man-made fibers. The major markets for plastics are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packaging" title="Packaging">packaging</a>, followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and games.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest-volume polymer product, <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" title="Polyethylene">polyethylene</a> (PE), is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles, containers, and pipe.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">Polyvinyl chloride</a> (PVC), another large-volume product, is principally used to make pipe for construction markets as well as siding and, to a much smaller extent, transportation and packaging materials.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Polypropylene" title="Polypropylene">Polypropylene</a> (PP), similar in volume to PVC, is used in markets ranging from packaging, appliances, and containers to clothing and carpeting.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Polystyrene" title="Polystyrene">Polystyrene</a> (PS), another large-volume plastic, is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Life_sciences">Life sciences</span></h3>
<p>Life sciences (about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business) include differentiated chemical and biological substances, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceuticals</a>, diagnostics, <a href="/wiki/Veterinary_medicine" title="Veterinary medicine">animal health products</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin" title="Vitamin">vitamins</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a>. While much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors, their products tend to have very high prices—over ten dollars per pound—growth rates of 1.5 to 6 times GDP, and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales. Life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. Pesticides, also called "crop protection chemicals", are about 10 percent of this category and include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herbicides" title="Herbicides">herbicides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" title="Insecticide">insecticides</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fungicide" title="Fungicide">fungicides</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialty_chemicals">Specialty chemicals</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specialty_chemicals" title="Specialty chemicals">Specialty chemicals</a> are a category of relatively high valued, rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets. Typical growth rates are one to three times GDP with prices over a dollar per pound. They are generally characterized by their innovative aspects. Products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain. Products include electronic chemicals, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_gases" title="Industrial gases">industrial gases</a>, adhesives and sealants as well as coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals, and catalysts. In 2012, excluding fine chemicals, the $546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33% Paints, Coating and Surface Treatments, 27% Advanced Polymer, 14% Adhesives and Sealants, 13% additives and 13% pigments and inks.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Speciality_chemicals" title="Speciality chemicals">Speciality chemicals</a> are sold as effect or performance chemicals. Sometimes they are mixtures of formulations, unlike "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fine_chemicals" title="Fine chemicals">fine chemicals</a>," which are almost always single-molecule products.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumer_products">Consumer products</span></h3>
<p>Consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as <a href="/wiki/Soap" title="Soap">soaps</a>, <a href="/wiki/Detergent" title="Detergent">detergents</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cosmetics" title="Cosmetics">cosmetics</a>. Typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times GDP.</p>
<p>Consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives, such as in plastics, cleaning materials, cosmetics, paints &amp; coatings, electronic gadgets, automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes. These speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polymers" title="Polymers">speciality polymers</a>, electronic chemicals, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surfactants" title="Surfactants">surfactants</a>, construction chemicals, Industrial Cleaners, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flavours" title="Flavours">flavours</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fragrances" title="Fragrances">fragrances</a>, speciality coatings, printing inks, water-soluble polymers, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_additives" title="Food additives">food additives</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paper_chemicals" title="Paper chemicals">paper chemicals</a>, oil field chemicals, plastic adhesives, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adhesives" title="Adhesives">adhesives</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sealants" title="Sealants">sealants</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cosmetic_ingredients" title="Cosmetic ingredients">cosmetic chemicals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">water management chemicals</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalysts" title="Catalysts">catalysts</a>, textile chemicals. Chemical companies rarely supply these products directly to the consumer.</p>
<p>Every year, the <a href="/wiki/American_Chemistry_Council" title="American Chemistry Council">American Chemistry Council</a> tabulates the U.S. production volume of the top 100 basic chemicals. In 2000, the aggregate production volume of the top 100 chemicals totalled 502 million tons, up from 397 million tons in 1990. Inorganic chemicals tend to be the largest volume, though much smaller in dollar revenue terms due to their low prices.

The products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a> especially <a href="/wiki/Fractional_distillation" title="Fractional distillation">fractional distillation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)" title="Precipitation (chemistry)">precipitation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crystallization" title="Crystallization">crystallization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">adsorption</a>, <a href="/wiki/Filtration" title="Filtration">filtration</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)" title="Sublimation (chemistry)">sublimation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Drying" title="Drying">drying</a>.</p>
<p>The processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site <a href="/wiki/Quality_control" title="Quality control">quality control</a> <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratories</a> to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specification" title="Specification">specifications</a>. More organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> standards. The products are packaged and delivered by many methods, including pipelines, tank-cars, and tank-trucks (for both solids and liquids), cylinders, drums, bottles, and boxes. Chemical companies often have a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Research-and-development" title="Research-and-development">research-and-development</a> laboratory for developing and testing products and processes. These facilities may include pilot plants, and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant(s).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="World_Chemical_Production">World Chemical Production</span></h2>

<p>The scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume (<a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemicals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commodity_chemicals" title="Commodity chemicals">commodity chemicals</a>), to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specialty_chemicals" title="Specialty chemicals">specialty chemicals</a>, and the smallest, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fine_chemicals" title="Fine chemicals">fine chemicals</a>.</p>
<p>The petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.</p>
<p>Those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> along the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="Gulf Coast of the United States">Gulf Coast</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, on <a href="/wiki/Teesside" title="Teesside">Teesside</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Northeast_of_England" title="Northeast of England">Northeast of England</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. The large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_stations" title="Power stations">power stations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Port" title="Port">port facilities</a>, road and rail terminals. To demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Northeast_of_England_Process_Industry_Cluster" title="Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster">Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster</a> on <a href="/wiki/Teesside" title="Teesside">Teesside</a>.</p>
<p>Specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes. These manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Continents_and_Countries">Continents and Countries</span></h3>
<p>In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies. They operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. The U.S. chemical output is $750 billion a year. The U.S. industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the United States alone. The chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over $5 billion annually on pollution abatement.</p>
<p>In Europe the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors. Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. Since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the EU.</p>
<p>in 2012 The chemical sector accounted for 12% of the EU manufacturing industry's added value. Europe remains world’s biggest chemical trading region with 43% of the world’s exports and 37%of the world’s imports, although the latest data shows that Asia is catching up with 34% of the exports and 37% of imports. Even so, Europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except Japan and China where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance. Europe’s trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion Euros.</p>
<p>Over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the European Chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion Euros to 539 billion Euros a picture of constant growth. Despite this the European industry’s share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36% to 20%. This has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like India and China. The data suggest that 95% of this impact is from China alone. In 2012 the data from the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)shows that 5 European countries account for 71% of the EU's chemicals sales. These are Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years. The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_polymer" title="Organic polymer">organic polymers</a> used as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plastics" title="Plastics">plastics</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fibres" title="Fibres">fibres</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elastomers" title="Elastomers">elastomers</a>. Historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world, Western Europe, North America and Japan (the Triad). The European Community remains the largest producer area followed by the US and Japan.</p>
<p>The traditional dominance of chemical production by the Triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price, labour cost, energy cost, differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures. Instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in China, India, Korea, the Middle East, South East Asia, Nigeria, and Brazil.</p>
<p>Just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry, we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank, with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export. Though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope, the bulk of the world’s $3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations. The United States alone produced $689 billion, 18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008.</p>
