<p>Historically, the production of wood charcoal in locations where there is an abundance of wood dates back to a very ancient period, and generally consists of piling <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Billet_(disambiguation)" title="Billet (disambiguation)">billets</a> of wood on their ends so as to form a conical pile, openings being left at the bottom to admit <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a>, with a central shaft to serve as a <a href="/wiki/Flue" title="Flue">flue</a>. The whole pile is covered with turf or moistened <a href="/wiki/Clay" title="Clay">clay</a>. The firing is begun at the bottom of the flue, and gradually spreads outwards and upwards. The success of the operation depends upon the rate of the <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a>. Under average conditions, 100 parts of wood yield about 60 parts by <a href="/wiki/Volume" title="Volume">volume</a>, or 25 parts by <a href="/wiki/Weight" title="Weight">weight</a>, of charcoal; small-scale production on the spot often yields only about 50%, while large-scale became efficient to about 90% even by the seventeenth century. The operation is so delicate that it was generally left to colliers (professional charcoal burners). They often lived alone in small huts in order to tend their wood piles. For example, in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harz_Mountains" title="Harz Mountains">Harz Mountains</a> of <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charcoal_burner" title="Charcoal burner">charcoal burners</a> lived in conical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Huts" title="Huts">huts</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6te" title="Köte">Köten</a></i> which are still much in evidence today.</p>

<p>The massive production of charcoal (at its height employing hundreds of thousands, mainly in Alpine and neighbouring forests) was a major cause of <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, especially in <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a>. In <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, many woods were managed as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coppice" title="Coppice">coppices</a>, which were cut and regrew cyclically, so that a steady supply of charcoal would be available (in principle) forever; complaints (as early as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stuart_period_(England)" title="Stuart period (England)">Stuart period</a>) about shortages may relate to the results of temporary <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Over-exploitation" title="Over-exploitation">over-exploitation</a> or the impossibility of increasing production to match growing demand. The increasing scarcity of easily harvested wood was a major factor behind the switch to <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> equivalents, mainly <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brown_coal" title="Brown coal">brown coal</a> for industrial use.</p>
<p>The modern process of carbonizing wood, either in small pieces or as <a href="/wiki/Sawdust" title="Sawdust">sawdust</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cast_iron" title="Cast iron">cast iron</a> <a href="/wiki/Retort" title="Retort">retorts</a>, is extensively practiced where wood is scarce, and also for the recovery of valuable byproducts (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wood_spirit" title="Wood spirit">wood spirit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pyroligneous_acid" title="Pyroligneous acid">pyroligneous acid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tar" title="Tar">wood tar</a>), which the process permits. The question of the <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Carbonization" title="Carbonization">carbonization</a> is important; according to J. Percy, wood becomes brown at 220 °C (428 °F), a deep brown-black after some time at 280 °C (536 °F), and an easily powdered mass at 310 °C (590 °F). Charcoal made at 300 °C (572 °F) is brown, soft and friable, and readily inflames at 380 °C (716 °F); made at higher temperatures it is hard and brittle, and does not fire until heated to about 700 °C (1,292 °F).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, the charcoal was considered the by-product of <a href="/wiki/Tar" title="Tar">wood tar</a> production. The best tar came from <a href="/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a>, thus pinewoods were cut down for tar <a href="/wiki/Pyrolysis" title="Pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a>. The residual charcoal was widely used as substitute for <a href="/wiki/Metallurgy" title="Metallurgy">metallurgical</a> <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a> in <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" title="Blast furnace">blast furnaces</a> for <a href="/wiki/Smelting" title="Smelting">smelting</a>. Tar production led to rapid <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>: it has been estimated all Finnish forests are younger than 300 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Years" title="Years">years</a>. The end of tar production at the end of the 19th century resulted in rapid re-forestation.</p>
<p>The charcoal <a href="/wiki/Briquette" title="Briquette">briquette</a> was first invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer of Pennsylvania in 1897 and was produced by the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Zwoyer_Fuel_Company&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Zwoyer Fuel Company (page does not exist)">Zwoyer Fuel Company</a>. The process was further popularized by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ford" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, who used wood and sawdust byproducts from <a href="/wiki/History_of_Ford_Motor_Company#Early_developments" title="History of Ford Motor Company">automobile fabrication</a> as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feedstock" title="Feedstock">feedstock</a>. Ford Charcoal went on to become the <a href="/wiki/Kingsford_(charcoal)" title="Kingsford (charcoal)">Kingsford Company</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production_methods">Production methods</span></h2>
<p>Charcoal has been made by various methods. The traditional method in <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> used a clamp. This is essentially a pile of wooden logs (e.g. seasoned oak) leaning against a chimney (logs are placed in a circle). The chimney consists of 4 wooden stakes held up by some rope. The logs are completely covered with soil and straw allowing no air to enter. It must be lit by introducing some burning fuel into the chimney; the logs burn very slowly and transform into charcoal in a period of 5 days' burning. If the soil covering gets torn (cracked) by the fire, additional soil is placed on the cracks. Once the burn is complete, the chimney is plugged to prevent air from entering. The true art of this production method is in managing the sufficient generation of heat (by combusting part of the wood material), and its transfer to wood parts in the process of being carbonised. A strong disadvantage of this production method is the huge amount of emissions that are harmful to human health and the environment (emissions of unburnt methane). As a result of the partial combustion of wood material, the efficiency of the traditional method is low.</p>
<p>Modern methods employ retorting technology, in which process heat is recovered from, and solely provided by, the combustion of gas released during carbonisation. (Illustration:). Yields of retorting are considerably higher than those of kilning, and may reach 35%-40%.</p>
<p>The properties of the charcoal produced depend on the material charred. The charring temperature is also important. Charcoal contains varying amounts of hydrogen and oxygen as well as <a href="/wiki/Wood_ash" title="Wood ash">ash</a> and other impurities that, together with the structure, determine the properties. The approximate composition of charcoal for <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowders</a> is sometimes empirically described as C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O. To obtain a coal with high purity, source material should be free of non-volatile compounds.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h2>



<ul>
<li><b>Common charcoal</b> is made from peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum.</li>
<li><b>Sugar charcoal</b> is obtained from the carbonization of sugar and is particularly pure. It is purified by boiling with acids to remove any mineral matter and is then burned for a long time in a current of chlorine in order to remove the last traces of hydrogen. It was used by <a href="/wiki/Henri_Moissan" title="Henri Moissan">Henri Moissan</a> in his early attempt to create <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_diamond" title="Synthetic diamond">synthetic diamonds</a>.</li>
<li><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Activated_charcoal" title="Activated charcoal">Activated charcoal</a></b> is similar to common charcoal but is made especially for medical use. To produce activated charcoal, manufacturers heat common charcoal in the presence of a gas that causes the charcoal to develop many internal spaces or "pores." These pores help activated charcoal trap chemicals.</li>
<li><b>Lump charcoal</b> is a traditional charcoal made directly from <a href="/wiki/Hardwood" title="Hardwood">hardwood</a> material. It usually produces far less ash than briquettes.</li>
<li><b>Japanese charcoal</b> has had <a href="/wiki/Pyroligneous_acid" title="Pyroligneous acid">pyroligneous acid</a> removed during the charcoal making; it therefore produces almost no smell or smoke when burned. The traditional charcoal of Japan is classified into two types:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>

<p>Charcoal has been used since earliest times for a large range of purposes including art and medicine, but by far its most important use has been as a metallurgical fuel. Charcoal is the traditional fuel of a blacksmith's forge and other applications where an intense heat is required. Charcoal was also used historically as a source of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_black" title="Carbon black">carbon black</a> by grinding it up. In this form charcoal was important to early chemists and was a constituent of formulas for mixtures such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_powder" title="Black powder">black powder</a>. Due to its high <a href="/wiki/Surface_area" title="Surface area">surface area</a> charcoal can be used as a filter, and as a <a href="/wiki/Carbocatalysis" title="Carbocatalysis">catalyst</a> or as an adsorbent.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Metallurgical_fuel">Metallurgical fuel</span></h3>
<p>Charcoal burns at intense temperatures, up to 2,700 °C (4,890 °F). By comparison the melting point of <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a> is approximately 1,200 to 1,550 °C (2,190 to 2,820 °F). Due to its porosity it is sensitive to the flow of air and the heat generated can be moderated by controlling the air flow to the fire. For this reason charcoal is still widely used by blacksmiths. Charcoal has been used for the production of iron since Roman times and <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> in modern times where it also provided the necessary carbon. Charcoal briquettes can burn up to approximately 2300 °F (1,260 °C) with a forced air blower forges.</p>
<p>In the 16th century England had to pass laws to prevent the country from becoming completely denuded of trees due to production of iron. In the 19th century charcoal was largely replaced by <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a>, baked coal, in steel production due to cost.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_fuel">Industrial fuel</span></h3>
<p>Historically, charcoal was used in great quantities for smelting <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bloomery" title="Bloomery">bloomeries</a> and later <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" title="Blast furnace">blast furnaces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Finery_forge" title="Finery forge">finery forges</a>. This use was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a> in the 19th Century as part of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooking_fuel">Cooking fuel</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the industrial revolution charcoal was occasionally used as a cooking fuel. Modern "charcoal <a href="/wiki/Briquette" title="Briquette">briquettes</a>", widely used for outdoor cooking, are not charcoal though they may contain some.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Syngas_production.2C_automotive_fuel">Syngas production, automotive fuel</span></h3>
<p>Like many other sources of carbon, charcoal can be used for the production of various <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a> compositions; i.e., various CO + H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> mixtures. The syngas is typically used as fuel, including automotive propulsion, or as a chemical feedstock.</p>
<p>In times of scarce petroleum, automobiles and even buses have been converted to burn <a href="/wiki/Wood_gas" title="Wood gas">wood gas</a> (a gas mixture consisting primarily of diluting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric" title="Atmospheric">atmospheric</a> <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, but also containing combustible gasses, mostly <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>) released by burning charcoal or wood in a <a href="/wiki/Wood_gas_generator" title="Wood gas generator">wood gas generator</a>. In 1931 <a href="/wiki/Tang_Zhongming" title="Tang Zhongming">Tang Zhongming</a> developed an automobile powered by charcoal, and these cars were popular in China until the 1950s and in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Occupied_France" title="Occupied France">occupied France</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> (called <i>gazogènes</i>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carbon_source">Carbon source</span></h3>
<p>Charcoal may be used as a source of carbon in chemical reactions. One example of this is the production of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_disulphide" title="Carbon disulphide">carbon disulphide</a> through the reaction of sulfur vapors with hot charcoal. In that case the wood should be charred at high temperature to reduce the residual amounts of hydrogen and oxygen that lead to side reactions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Purification_and_filtration">Purification and filtration</span></h3>

<p>Charcoal may be <i>activated</i> to increase its effectiveness as a filter. <a href="/wiki/Activated_carbon" title="Activated carbon">Activated charcoal</a> readily <a href="/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">adsorbs</a> a wide range of organic compounds dissolved or suspended in gases and liquids. In certain industrial processes, such as the purification of sucrose from cane sugar, impurities cause an undesirable color, which can be removed with activated charcoal. It is also used to absorb <a href="/wiki/Odor" title="Odor">odors</a> and toxins in gases, such as air. Charcoal filters are also used in some types of <a href="/wiki/Gas_mask" title="Gas mask">gas masks</a>. The medical use of activated charcoal is mainly the <a href="/wiki/Absorption_(chemistry)" title="Absorption (chemistry)">absorption</a> of <a href="/wiki/Toxin" title="Toxin">poisons</a>. Activated charcoal is available without a prescription, so it is used for a variety of health-related applications. For example, it is often used to reduce discomfort and embarrassment due to excessive gas (<a href="/wiki/Flatulence" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>) in the digestive tract.</p>
<p>Animal charcoal or bone black is the carbonaceous <a href="/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)" title="Residue (chemistry)">residue</a> obtained by the dry distillation of bones. It contains only about 10% carbon, the remainder being calcium and <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> phosphates (80%) and other inorganic material originally present in the bones. It is generally manufactured from the residues obtained in the <a href="/wiki/Animal_glue" title="Animal glue">glue</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a> industries. Its decolorizing power was applied in 1812 by Derosne to the clarification of the <a href="/wiki/Syrup" title="Syrup">syrups</a> obtained in <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> refining; but its use in this direction has now greatly diminished, owing to the introduction of more active and easily managed reagents. It is still used to some extent in <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> practice. The decolorizing power is not permanent, becoming lost after using for some time; it may be revived, however, by washing and reheating. Wood charcoal also to some extent removes coloring material from solutions, but animal charcoal is generally more effective.</p>
