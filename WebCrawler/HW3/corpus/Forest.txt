<p>A <b>forest</b> is a large area dominated by <a href="/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">trees</a>. Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function. According to the widely used <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> definition, forests covered four billion hectares (15 million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land area in 2006.</p>
<p>Forests are the dominant terrestrial <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of Earth, and are distributed across the globe. Forests account for 75% of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gross_primary_productivity" title="Gross primary productivity">gross primary productivity</a> of the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.</p>
<p>Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecozone" title="Ecozone">ecozones</a>: <a href="/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">boreal forests</a> near the poles, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests">tropical forests</a> near the equator and <a href="/wiki/Temperate_forest" title="Temperate forest">temperate forests</a> at mid-latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.</p>
<p>Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways. Forests provide <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people's health. Human activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>

<p>Although <i>forest</i> is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised precise definition, with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world. Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees, under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past, will grow trees in the future, or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type.</p>
<p>There are three broad categories of forest definitions in use: administrative, <a href="/wiki/Land_use" title="Land use">land use</a>, and land cover. Administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land, and commonly bear little relationship to the vegetation growing on the land: land that is legally designated as a forest is defined as a forest even if no trees are growing on it. Land use definitions are based upon the primary purpose that the land serves. For example, a forest may defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a land use definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry, or areas within the region that have been cleared by harvesting, disease or fire are still considered forests even if they contain no trees. Land cover definitions define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are typically the number of trees per area (density), the area of ground under the tree canopy (canopy cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area). Under such land cover definitions, and area of land only be defined as forest if it is growing trees. Areas that fail to meet the land cover definition may be still included under while immature trees are establishing if they are expected to meet the definition at maturity.</p>
<p>Under land use definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest, <a href="/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a>. Under some definitions, forests require very high levels of tree canopy cover, from 60% to 100%, excluding savannas and woodlands in which trees have a lower <a href="/wiki/Crown_closure" title="Crown closure">canopy cover</a>. Other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest, and include all areas with tree canopies over 10%.</p>
<p>Conversely some areas covered in trees are legally defined as agricultural areas. For example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norway_spruce" title="Norway spruce">Norway spruce</a> plantations in Austrian forest law when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and below a certain height.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>

<p>The word <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/forest" title="wikt:forest">forest</a></i> comes from <a href="/wiki/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> <i>forest</i> (also <i>forès</i>) "forest, vast expanse covered by trees"; first introduced in English as the word for wild land set aside for hunting without the necessity in definition for the existence of trees. Possibly a borrowing (probably via <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Old_Frankish" title="Old Frankish">Frankish</a> or <a href="/wiki/Old_High_German" title="Old High German">Old High German</a>) of the <a href="/wiki/Medieval_Latin" title="Medieval Latin">Medieval Latin</a> word <i>foresta</i> "open wood", <i>foresta</i> was first used by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carolingian" title="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> scribes in the Capitularies of <a href="/wiki/Charlemagne" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> to refer specifically to the king's royal hunting grounds. The term was not endemic to Romance languages (e.g. native words for "forest" in the Romance languages evolved out of the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>silva</i> "forest, wood" (English <i>sylvan</i>); cf. Italian, Spanish, Portuguese <i>selva</i>; Romanian <i>silvă</i>; Old French <i>selve</i>); and cognates in Romance languages, such as Italian <i>foresta</i>, Spanish and Portuguese <i>floresta</i>, etc. are all ultimately borrowings of the French word.</p>
<p>The exact origin of Medieval Latin <i>foresta</i> is obscure. Some authorities claim the word derives from the <a href="/wiki/Late_Latin" title="Late Latin">Late Latin</a> phrase <i>forestam silvam</i>, meaning "the outer wood"; others claim the term is a latinisation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Old_Frankish" title="Old Frankish">Frankish</a> word *<i>forhist</i> "forest, wooded country", assimilated to <i>forestam silvam</i> (a common practice among Frankish scribes). Frankish *<i>forhist</i> is attested by <a href="/wiki/Old_High_German" title="Old High German">Old High German</a> <i>forst</i> "forest", <a href="/wiki/Middle_Low_German" title="Middle Low German">Middle Low German</a> <i>vorst</i> "forest", <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> <i>fyrhþ</i> "forest, woodland, game preserve, hunting ground" (English <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frith" title="wikt:frith">frith</a></i>), and <a href="/wiki/Old_Norse" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a> <i>fýri</i> "coniferous forest", all of which derive from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proto-Germanic" title="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> *<i>furhísa-</i>, *<i>furhíþija-</i> "a fir-wood, coniferous forest", from <a href="/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European</a> *<i>perku-</i> "a coniferous or mountain forest, wooded height".</p>
<p>Uses of the word "forest" in English to denote any uninhabited area of non-enclosure are now considered archaic. The word was introduced by the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman rulers of England</a> as a legal term (appearing in Latin texts like the <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>) denoting an uncultivated area legally set aside for hunting by feudal nobility (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Forest" title="Royal Forest">Royal Forest</a>).</p>

<p>These hunting forests were not necessarily wooded much, if at all. However, as hunting forests did often include considerable areas of woodland, the word "forest" eventually came to mean wooded land more generally. By the start of the 14th century, the word appeared in English texts, indicating all three senses: the most common one, the legal term and the archaic usage. Other terms used to mean "an area with a high density of trees" are <i>wood, woodland, wold, weald, holt, frith</i> and <i>firth</i>. Unlike <i>forest</i>, these are all derived from Old English and were not borrowed from another language. Some classifications now reserve the term <i>woodland</i> for an area with more open space between trees and distinguish among woodlands, <i>open forests</i>, and <i>closed forests</i> based on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crown_cover" title="Crown cover">crown cover</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Evolution">Evolution</span></h2>
<p>The first known forests on Earth arose in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Late_Devonian" title="Late Devonian">Late Devonian</a> (approximately 380 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mya_(unit)" title="Mya (unit)">million years ago</a>), with the evolution of <i><a href="/wiki/Archaeopteris" title="Archaeopteris">Archaeopteris</a></i>. <i>Archaeopteris</i> was a plant that was both tree-like and fern-like, growing to 10 metres (33 ft) in height. <i>Archaeopteris</i> quickly spread throughout the world, from the equator to subpolar latitudes. <i>Archaeopteris</i> formed the first forest by being the first known species to cast shade due to its fronds and forming soil from its roots. <i>Archaeopteris</i> was deciduous, dropping its fronds onto the forest floor. The shade, soil, and forest duff from the dropped fronds created the first forest. The shed organic matter altered the freshwater environment, slowing it down and providing food. This promoted freshwater fish.</p>

Forest ecosystems can be found in all regions capable of sustaining tree growth, at altitudes up to the <a href="/wiki/Tree_line" title="Tree line">tree line</a>, except where natural fire frequency or other disturbance is too high, or where the environment has been altered by human activity.</p>
<p>The latitudes 10° north and south of the <a href="/wiki/Equator" title="Equator">equator</a> are mostly covered in <a href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>, and the latitudes between <a href="/wiki/53rd_parallel_north" title="53rd parallel north">53°N</a> and <a href="/wiki/67th_parallel_north" title="67th parallel north">67°N</a> have <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boreal_forest" title="Boreal forest">boreal forest</a>. As a general rule, forests dominated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angiosperms" title="Angiosperms">angiosperms</a> (<i>broadleaf forests</i>) are more species-rich than those dominated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gymnosperms" title="Gymnosperms">gymnosperms</a> (<i>conifer</i>, <i>montane</i>, or <i>needleleaf forests</i>), although exceptions exist.</p>
<p>Forests sometimes contain many tree species within a small area (as in <a href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temperate_deciduous_forest" title="Temperate deciduous forest">temperate deciduous forests</a>), or relatively few species over large areas (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a> and arid <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Montane" title="Montane">montane</a> coniferous forests). Forests are often home to many animal and plant species, and <a href="/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)" title="Biomass (ecology)">biomass</a> per unit area is high compared to other vegetation communities. Much of this biomass occurs below ground in the root systems and as partially decomposed plant <a href="/wiki/Detritus" title="Detritus">detritus</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Components">Components</span></h3>

<p>A forest consists of many components that can be broadly divided into two categories that are biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. The living parts include <a href="/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">trees</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrubs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vine" title="Vine">vines</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grasses</a> and other herbaceous (non-woody) plants, <a href="/wiki/Moss" title="Moss">mosses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amphibian" title="Amphibian">amphibians</a>, and microorganisms living on the plants and animals and in the soil.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Layers">Layers</span></h3>


<p>A forest is made up of many layers. Starting from the ground level and moving up, the main layers of all forest types are the forest floor, the understory and the canopy. The emergent layer exists in tropical rainforests. Each layer has a different set of plants and animals depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture and food.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Forest floor</b> contains decomposing leaves, animal droppings, and dead trees. All of decay on the forest floor and form the new soil and provides nutrients to the plants. The forest floor supports ferns, grasses, mushroom and trees seedlings.</li>
<li><b>Understory</b> is made up of bushes, shrubs, and young trees that are adapted to living in the shades of the canopy.</li>
<li><b>Canopy</b> is formed by the mass of intertwined branches, twigs and leaves of the mature trees. The crowns of the dominant trees receive most of the sunlight. This is the most productive part of the trees where maximum food is produced. The canopy forms a shady, protective "umbrella" over the rest of the forest.</li>
<li><b>Emergent layer</b> exists in the tropical rain forest and is composed of a few scattered trees that tower over the canopy.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h3>
<p><span id="Types_of_forest"></span> <span id="Classification"></span> Forests can be classified in different ways and to different degrees of specificity. One such way is in terms of the <a href="/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">biome</a> in which they exist, combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are <a href="/wiki/Evergreen" title="Evergreen">evergreen</a> or <a href="/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a>). Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer">coniferous</a> (needle-leaved) trees, or mixed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boreal_forest" title="Boreal forest">Boreal forests</a> occupy the <a href="/wiki/Subarctic" title="Subarctic">subarctic</a> zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate">Temperate</a> zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests (<i>e.g.</i>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests" title="Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests">temperate deciduous forest</a>) and evergreen coniferous forests (<i>e.g.</i>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate_coniferous_forests" title="Temperate coniferous forests">temperate coniferous forests</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temperate_rainforest" title="Temperate rainforest">temperate rainforests</a>). Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including <a href="/wiki/Laurel_forest" title="Laurel forest">laurel forests</a>.</li>
<li>Tropical and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subtropical" title="Subtropical">subtropical</a> forests include <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests">tropical and subtropical moist forests</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests">tropical and subtropical dry forests</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests">tropical and subtropical coniferous forests</a>.</li>
<li>Physiognomy classifies forests based on their overall physical structure or <a href="/wiki/Ecological_succession" title="Ecological succession">developmental</a> stage (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Old_growth" title="Old growth">old growth</a> vs. <a href="/wiki/Secondary_forest" title="Secondary forest">second growth</a>).</li>
<li>Forests can also be classified more specifically based on the climate and the dominant tree species present, resulting in numerous different forest types (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ponderosa_pine" title="Ponderosa pine">Ponderosa pine</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Douglas-fir" title="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> forest).</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3 trillion, of which 1.4 trillion are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.6 trillion in the temperate zones, and 0.7 trillion in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, and is based on tree densities <a href="/wiki/Forest_inventory" title="Forest inventory">measured</a> on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Forests can also be classified according to the amount of human alteration. <a href="/wiki/Old-growth_forest" title="Old-growth forest">Old-growth forest</a> contains mainly natural patterns of biodiversity in established <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seral" title="Seral">seral</a> patterns, and they contain mainly species native to the region and habitat. In contrast, <a href="/wiki/Secondary_forest" title="Secondary forest">secondary forest</a> is regrowing forest following timber harvest and may contain species originally from other regions or habitats.</p>
<p>Different global forest classification systems have been proposed, but none has gained universal acceptance. UNEP-WCMC's forest category classification system is a simplification of other more complex systems (e.g. <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>'s forest and woodland 'subformations'). This system divides the world's forests into 26 major types, which reflect climatic zones as well as the principal types of trees. These 26 major types can be reclassified into 6 broader categories: temperate needleleaf; temperate broadleaf and mixed; tropical moist; tropical dry; sparse trees and parkland; and forest plantations. Each category is described as a separate section below.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Temperate_needleleaf">Temperate needleleaf</span></h4>
<p><span id="Coniferous_forests"></span> Temperate needleleaf forests mostly occupy the higher latitude regions of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Northern_hemisphere" title="Northern hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a>, as well as high altitude zones and some warm temperate areas, especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soils" title="Soils">soils</a>. These forests are composed entirely, or nearly so, of coniferous species (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coniferophyta" title="Coniferophyta">Coniferophyta</a>). In the Northern Hemisphere pines <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pinus" title="Pinus">Pinus</a></i>, spruces <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Picea" title="Picea">Picea</a></i>, larches <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Larix" title="Larix">Larix</a></i>, firs <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abies" title="Abies">Abies</a></i>, Douglas firs <i><a href="/wiki/Pseudotsuga" title="Pseudotsuga">Pseudotsuga</a></i> and hemlocks <i><a href="/wiki/Tsuga" title="Tsuga">Tsuga</a></i>, make up the canopy, but other taxa are also important. In the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, most coniferous trees (members of the <a href="/wiki/Araucariaceae" title="Araucariaceae">Araucariaceae</a> and <a href="/wiki/Podocarpaceae" title="Podocarpaceae">Podocarpaceae</a>) occur in mixtures with broadleaf species, and are classed as broadleaf and mixed forests.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed">Temperate broadleaf and mixed</span></h4>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests" title="Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests">Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests</a> include a substantial component of trees in the <a href="/wiki/Anthophyta" title="Anthophyta">Anthophyta</a>. They are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes, but extend to cool temperate ones, particularly in the southern hemisphere. They include such forest types as the mixed deciduous forests of the United States and their counterparts in China and Japan, the broadleaf evergreen <a href="/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforests</a> of Japan, <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sclerophyllous" title="Sclerophyllous">sclerophyllous</a> forests of Australia, central Chile, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and California, and the southern beech <a href="/wiki/Nothofagus" title="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a> forests of Chile and New Zealand.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tropical_moist">Tropical moist</span></h4>
<p>There are many different types of <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests">tropical moist forests</a>, with lowland evergreen broad leaf <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforests" title="Tropical rainforests">tropical rainforests</a>, for example <a href="/wiki/V%C3%A1rzea_forest" title="Várzea forest">várzea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cant%C3%A3o#Natural_Communities" title="Cantão">igapó forests</a> and the terra firma forests of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amazon_Basin" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon Basin</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Peat_swamp_forest" title="Peat swamp forest">peat swamp forests</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dipterocarp" title="Dipterocarp">dipterocarp</a> forests of Southeast Asia; and the <a href="/wiki/High_forest_(woodland)" title="High forest (woodland)">high forests</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Congo_Basin" title="Congo Basin">Congo Basin</a>. <a href="/wiki/Seasonal_tropical_forest" title="Seasonal tropical forest">Seasonal tropical forests</a>, perhaps the best description for the colloquial term "<a href="/wiki/Jungle" title="Jungle">jungle</a>", typically range from the rainforest zone 10 degrees north or south of the <a href="/wiki/Equator" title="Equator">equator</a>, to the <a href="/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer" title="Tropic of Cancer">Tropic of Cancer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn" title="Tropic of Capricorn">Tropic of Capricorn</a>. Forests located on mountains are also included in this category, divided largely into upper and lower <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Montane_ecology" title="Montane ecology">montane</a> formations on the basis of the variation of physiognomy corresponding to changes in altitude.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tropical_dry">Tropical dry</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests">Tropical dry forests</a> are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought. The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy, with most trees being leafless for several months of the year. However, under some conditions, e.g. less fertile soils or less predictable drought regimes, the proportion of evergreen species increases and the forests are characterised as "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sclerophyllous" title="Sclerophyllous">sclerophyllous</a>". <a href="/wiki/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands" title="Deserts and xeric shrublands">Thorn forest</a>, a dense forest of low stature with a high frequency of thorny or spiny species, is found where drought is prolonged, and especially where grazing animals are plentiful. On very poor soils, and especially where fire or herbivory are recurrent phenomena, <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannas</a> develop.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sparse_trees_and_parkland">Sparse trees and parkland</span></h4>

<p>Sparse trees and <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a> are forests with lower <a href="/wiki/Canopy_(biology)" title="Canopy (biology)">canopy</a> cover of trees. They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> occur are in the <a href="/wiki/Boreal_ecosystem" title="Boreal ecosystem">boreal</a> region and in the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Seasonally_dry_tropics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Seasonally dry tropics (page does not exist)">seasonally dry tropics</a>. At high latitudes, north of the main zone of boreal forest, growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuous closed forest cover, so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous. This vegetation is variously called open <a href="/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a>, open <a href="/wiki/Lichen" title="Lichen">lichen</a> woodland, and forest tundra. A savanna is a mixed <a href="/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a> <a href="/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grassland</a> <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canopy_(forest)" title="Canopy (forest)">canopy</a> does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herbaceous" title="Herbaceous">herbaceous</a> layer consisting primarily of grasses. Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Forest_plantations">Forest plantations</span></h4>
<p>Forest plantations are generally intended for the production of timber and <a href="/wiki/Pulpwood" title="Pulpwood">pulpwood</a>. Commonly mono-specific and/or composed of introduced tree species, these <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystems" title="Ecosystems">ecosystems</a> are not generally important as habitat for native <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. However, they can be managed in ways that enhance their biodiversity protection functions and they can provide ecosystem services such as maintaining nutrient capital, protecting <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">watersheds</a> and soil structure, and storing carbon.</p>

<p>The management of forests is often referred to as <a href="/wiki/Forestry" title="Forestry">forestry</a>. <a href="/wiki/Forest_management" title="Forest management">Forest management</a> has changed considerably over the last few centuries, with rapid changes from the 1980s onwards culminating in a practice now referred to as <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_forest_management" title="Sustainable forest management">sustainable forest management</a>. Forest ecologists concentrate on forest patterns and processes, usually with the aim of elucidating cause-and-effect relationships. <a href="/wiki/Forester" title="Forester">Foresters</a> who practice <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_forest_management" title="Sustainable forest management">sustainable forest management</a> focus on the integration of ecological, social, and economic values, often in <a href="/wiki/Stakeholder_engagement" title="Stakeholder engagement">consultation with local communities and other stakeholders</a>.</p>
<p>Humans have generally decreased the amount of forest worldwide. Anthropogenic factors that can affect forests include logging, <a href="/wiki/Urban_sprawl" title="Urban sprawl">urban sprawl</a>, human-caused <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forest_fire" title="Forest fire">forest fires</a>, <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Invasive_species" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slash_and_burn" title="Slash and burn">slash and burn</a> practices of swidden agriculture or <a href="/wiki/Shifting_cultivation" title="Shifting cultivation">shifting cultivation</a>. The loss and re-growth of forest leads to a distinction between two broad types of forest, primary or <a href="/wiki/Old-growth_forest" title="Old-growth forest">old-growth forest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Secondary_forest" title="Secondary forest">secondary forest</a>. There are also many natural factors that can cause changes in forests over time including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forest_fires" title="Forest fires">forest fires</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forest_pathology#Animals" title="Forest pathology">insects</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forest_pathology" title="Forest pathology">diseases</a>, weather, competition between species, etc. In 1997, the World Resources Institute recorded that only 20% of the world's original forests remained in large intact tracts of undisturbed forest. More than 75% of these intact forests lie in three countries—the <a href="/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">boreal forests</a> of Russia and Canada and the rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization_of_the_United_Nations" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> reported that world deforestation, mainly the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land, had decreased over the past ten years but still continues at a high rate in many countries. Globally, around 13 million hectares of forests were converted to other uses or lost through natural causes each year between 2000 and 2010 as compared to around 16 million hectares per year during the 1990s. The study covered 233 countries and areas. Brazil and Indonesia, which had the highest loss of forests in the 1990s, have significantly reduced their deforestation rates. China instituted a ban on logging, beginning in 1998, due to the erosion and flooding that it caused. In addition, ambitious tree planting programmes in countries such as China, India, the United States and Vietnam - combined with natural expansion of forests in some regions - have added more than seven million hectares of new forests annually. As a result, the net loss of forest area was reduced to 5.2 million hectares per year between 2000 and 2010, down from 8.3 million hectares annually in the 1990s. In 2015, a study for <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_Climate_Change" title="Nature Climate Change">Nature Climate Change</a></i> showed that the trend has recently been reversed, leading to an "overall gain" in global biomass and forests. This gain is due especially to reforestation in China and Russia. However new forests are not completely equivalent to old growth forests in terms of species diversity, resilience and carbon capture. On September 7, 2015, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization_of_the_United_Nations" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> released a new study stating that, over the last 25 years, the global <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> rate has decreased by 50% due to improved <a href="/wiki/Forest_management" title="Forest management">management of forests</a> and greater government protection.</p>
<p>Smaller areas of <a href="/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a> in cities may be managed as <a href="/wiki/Urban_forestry" title="Urban forestry">urban forestry</a>, sometimes within public parks. These are often created for human benefits; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attention_Restoration_Theory" title="Attention Restoration Theory">Attention Restoration Theory</a> argues that spending time in nature reduces stress and improves health, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forest_School_(education)" title="Forest School (education)">forest schools</a> and <a href="/wiki/Forest_kindergarten" title="Forest kindergarten">kindergartens</a> help young people to develop social as well as scientific skills in forests. These typically need to be close to where the children live, for practical logistics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h3>

<p>Canada has about 4,020,000 square kilometres (1,550,000 sq mi) of forest land. More than 90% of forest land is publicly owned and about 50% of the total forest area is allocated for harvesting. These allocated areas are managed using the principles of <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_forest_management" title="Sustainable forest management">sustainable forest management</a>, which includes extensive consultation with local stakeholders. About eight percent of Canada’s forest is legally protected from resource development. Much more forest land—about 40 percent of the total forest land base—is subject to varying degrees of protection through processes such as integrated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Land_use_planning" title="Land use planning">land use planning</a> or defined management areas such as certified forests.</p>
<p>By December 2006, over 1,237,000 square kilometers of forest land in Canada (about half the global total) had been certified as being sustainably managed. <a href="/wiki/Clearcutting" title="Clearcutting">Clearcutting</a>, first used in the latter half of the 20th century, is less expensive, but devastating to the environment, and companies are required by law to ensure that harvested areas are adequately regenerated. Most Canadian provinces have regulations limiting the size of clearcuts, although some older clearcuts can range upwards of 110 square kilometres (27,000 acres) in size which were cut over several years.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>

<p>In the United States, most forests have historically been affected by humans to some degree, though in recent years improved forestry practices has helped regulate or moderate large scale or severe impacts. However, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service" title="United States Forest Service">United States Forest Service</a> estimates a net loss of about 2 million hectares (4,942,000 acres) between 1997 and 2020; this estimate includes conversion of forest land to other uses, including urban and suburban development, as well as afforestation and natural reversion of abandoned crop and pasture land to forest. However, in many areas of the United States, the area of forest is stable or increasing, particularly in many northern states. The opposite problem from flooding has plagued national forests, with loggers complaining that a lack of thinning and proper forest management has resulted in large forest fires.</p>
