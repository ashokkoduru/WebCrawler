<p>In the abstract, <b>property</b> is that which belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, property is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether <a href="/wiki/Tangible_property" title="Tangible property">physical</a> or <a href="/wiki/Intangible_property" title="Intangible property">incorporeal</a>, of a person's <a href="/wiki/Estate_(law)" title="Estate (law)">estate</a>; or so belonging to, as in being <a href="/wiki/Ownership" title="Ownership">owned</a> by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a <a href="/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">corporation</a> or even a <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>. (Given such meaning, the word property is <a href="/wiki/Mass_noun" title="Mass noun">uncountable</a>, and as such, is not described with an indefinite article or as plural.) Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consumable" title="Consumable">consume</a>, alter, <a href="/wiki/Easement" title="Easement">share, redefine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Renting" title="Renting">rent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mortgage_law" title="Mortgage law">mortgage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Collateral_(finance)" title="Collateral (finance)">pawn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sales" title="Sales">sell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barter" title="Barter">exchange</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transfer_payment" title="Transfer payment">transfer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gift" title="Gift">give away</a> or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps <a href="/wiki/Lost,_mislaid,_and_abandoned_property" title="Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property">abandon</a> it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a <a href="/wiki/Durable_good" title="Durable good">durable</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fixed_investment" title="Fixed investment">mean or factor</a>, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.</p>
<p>In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private property</a>, <a href="/wiki/Public_property" title="Public property">public property</a>, and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Collective_property&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Collective property (page does not exist)">collective property</a> (also called <a href="/wiki/Cooperative" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a> property).</p>
<p>Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be <a href="/wiki/Unanimity" title="Unanimity">unanimous</a>, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Restatements_of_the_Law" title="Restatements of the Law">Restatement</a> (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between "collective property" and "private property" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.</p>
<p>Important widely recognized types of property include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Realty" title="Realty">real property</a> (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), <a href="/wiki/Personal_property" title="Personal property">personal property</a> (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> (exclusive rights over artistic <a href="/wiki/Gene_theft#Property_and_Commercialization_of_Body_Tissue" title="Gene theft">creations, inventions</a>, etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A <a href="/wiki/Title_(property)" title="Title (property)">title</a>, or a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Right" title="Right">right</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ownership" title="Ownership">ownership</a>, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Often property is defined by the code of the local <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a>, and protected wholly or more usually partially by such entity, the owner being responsible for any remainder of protection. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Standard_of_proof" title="Standard of proof">standards of proof</a> concerning proofs of ownerships are also addressed by the code of the local sovereignty, and such entity plays a role accordingly, typically <a href="/wiki/Recorder_of_deeds" title="Recorder of deeds">somewhat managerial</a>. Some philosophers assert that property <a href="/wiki/Rights" title="Rights">rights</a> arise from <a href="/wiki/Convention_(norm)" title="Convention (norm)">social convention</a>, while others find justifications for them in <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a> or in <a href="/wiki/Natural_law" title="Natural law">natural law</a>.</p>
<p>Property, in the first instance, is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thing-in-itself" title="Thing-in-itself">thing-in-itself</a>. When a person finds a thing and takes that thing into that person's possession and control, then that thing becomes a thing-for-you for that person. Once the person has that thing in that person's possession, that thing becomes that person's property by reason of discovery and conquest, and that person has the individual right to defend that property (property interest) against all others by reason of <a href="/wiki/Self-help" title="Self-help">self-help</a>. Typically, persons join together to form a political <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> which may develop a formal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legal_system" title="Legal system">legal system</a> which enforces and protects property rights so that the individual can go to court to get protection and enforcement of that person's property rights, rather than having to use self-help. It is possible that when a person has <a href="/wiki/Constructive_possession" title="Constructive possession">constructive possession</a> of personal property, but another person has actual possession, then the person having constructive possession has bare legal title, while the other person has actual possession. Generally, the ground and any buildings which are permanently attached are considered <a href="/wiki/Real_property" title="Real property">real property</a>, while movable goods and intangibles such as a copyright are considered personal property. Also, property cannot be considered a <a href="/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)" title="Reification (fallacy)">reified concept</a>, because in the first instance, property is very concrete as a physical thing-in-itself.</p>
<p>Various scholarly disciplines (such as <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a>) may treat the concept more systematically, but definitions vary, most particularly when involving <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contracts" title="Contracts">contracts</a>. <a href="/wiki/Positive_law" title="Positive law">Positive law</a> defines such rights, and the <a href="/wiki/Judiciary" title="Judiciary">judiciary</a> can adjudicate and enforce property rights.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, the expectation of profit from "improving one's stock of capital" rests on private property rights. <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a> has as a central assumption that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">wealth</a>, and efficiently allocate <a href="/wiki/Factors_of_production" title="Factors of production">resources</a> based on the operation of markets. From this has evolved the modern conception of property as a right enforced by positive law, in the expectation that this will produce more wealth and better standards of living. However, Smith also expressed a very critical view on the effects of property laws on inequality:</p>

<p>In his text <i>The Common Law</i>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr." title="Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> describes property as having two fundamental aspects. The first, possession, can be defined as control over a resource based on the practical inability of another to contradict the ends of the possessor. The second, title, is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resource, even when it is not in possession. He elaborates the differences between these two concepts, and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or to entities such as the church.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Classical_liberalism" title="Classical liberalism">Classical liberalism</a> subscribes to the <a href="/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property" title="Labor theory of property">labor theory of property</a>. They hold that individuals each own their own life, it follows that one must own the products of that life, and that those products can be traded in free exchange with others.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a> subscribes to the concept that freedom and property are closely linked. That the more widespread the possession of private property, the more stable and productive is a state or nation. Economic leveling of property, conservatives maintain, especially of the forced kind, is not economic progress.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>'s fundamental principles center on a critique of this concept, stating (among other things) that the cost of defending property exceeds the returns from private-property ownership, and that, even when property rights encourage their holders to develop their property or generate wealth, they do so only for their own benefit, which may not coincide with benefit to other people or to society at large.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Libertarian_socialism" title="Libertarian socialism">Libertarian socialism</a> generally accepts property rights, but with a short abandonment period. In other words, a person must make (more-or-less) continuous use of the item or else lose ownership rights. This is usually referred to as "possession property" or "<a href="/wiki/Usufruct" title="Usufruct">usufruct</a>". Thus, in this usufruct system, absentee ownership is illegitimate and workers own the machines or other equipment that they work with.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a> argues that only collective ownership of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> through a <a href="/wiki/Body_politic" title="Body politic">polity</a> (though not necessarily a <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a>) will assure the minimization of unequal or unjust outcomes and the maximization of benefits, and that therefore humans should abolish private ownership of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a> (as opposed to property).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both communism and some kinds of socialism have also upheld the notion that private ownership of capital is inherently illegitimate. This argument centers mainly on the idea that private ownership of capital always benefits one <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a> over another, giving rise to domination through the use of this privately owned capital. Communists do not oppose personal property that is "hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned" (as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communist_Manifesto" title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a> puts it) by members of the <a href="/wiki/Proletariat" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a>. Both socialism and communism distinguish carefully between private ownership of capital (land, factories, resources, etc.) and private property (homes, material objects and so forth).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_property">Types of property</span></h3>
<p>Most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legal_system" title="Legal system">legal systems</a> distinguish between different types of property, especially between land (<a href="/wiki/Immovable_property" title="Immovable property">immovable property</a>, <a href="/wiki/Estate_in_land" title="Estate in land">estate in land</a>, <a href="/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">real estate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Real_property" title="Real property">real property</a>) and all other forms of property—goods and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chattels" title="Chattels">chattels</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Movable_property" title="Movable property">movable property</a> or <a href="/wiki/Personal_property" title="Personal property">personal property</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Face_value" title="Face value">value of legal tender</a> if not the <a href="/wiki/Legal_tender" title="Legal tender">legal tender itself</a>, as the <a href="/wiki/Currency#Control_and_production" title="Currency">manufacturer</a> rather than the possessor might be the owner. They often distinguish <a href="/wiki/Tangible_property" title="Tangible property">tangible</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intangible_property" title="Intangible property">intangible property</a>. One categorization scheme specifies three species of property: land, improvements (immovable man-made things), and personal property (movable man-made things).</p>
<p>Dead Investment property, it is a property from which you cannot derive any profits. Scenario the property might be not in a suitable condition to use or cannot be used to earn profits. Investors also say that the properties where we stay are Dead Investments.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Real_property" title="Real property">real property</a> (<a href="/wiki/Immovable_property" title="Immovable property">immovable property</a>) is the combination of <a href="/wiki/Rights" title="Rights">interests</a> in land and improvements thereto, and <a href="/wiki/Personal_property" title="Personal property">personal property</a> is interest in movable property. Real property rights are rights relating to the land. These rights include ownership and usage. Owners can grant rights to persons and entities in the form of <a href="/wiki/Lease" title="Lease">leases</a>, <a href="/wiki/License" title="License">licenses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Easement" title="Easement">easements</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the last centuries of the <a href="/wiki/2nd_millennium" title="2nd millennium">second millennium</a>, with the development of more complex theories of property, the concept of personal property had become divided into tangible property (such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">cars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clothing" title="Clothing">clothing</a>) and intangible property (such as <a href="/wiki/Financial_instrument" title="Financial instrument">financial instruments</a>—including <a href="/wiki/Stock" title="Stock">stocks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bond_(finance)" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a>—<a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a>—including <a href="/wiki/Patent" title="Patent">patents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyrights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trademark" title="Trademark">trademarks</a>—<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_file" title="Digital file">digital files</a>, <a href="/wiki/Channel_(communications)" title="Channel (communications)">communication channels</a>, and certain forms of <a href="/wiki/Identifier" title="Identifier">identifier</a>—including <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">Internet domain names</a>, some forms of <a href="/wiki/Network_address" title="Network address">network address</a>, some forms of <a href="/wiki/Call_sign" title="Call sign">handle</a> and again trademarks).</p>
<p>Treatment of intangible property is such that an article of property is, by law or otherwise by traditional conceptualization, subject to expiration even when <a href="/wiki/Inheritance" title="Inheritance">inheritable</a>, which is a key distinction from tangible property. Upon expiration, the property, if of the intellectual category, becomes a part of <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a>, to be used by but not owned by anybody, and possibly used by more than one party simultaneously due the inapplicability of <a href="/wiki/Scarcity" title="Scarcity">scarcity</a> to intellectual property. Whereas things such as communications channels and pairs of electromagnetic spectrum band and signal transmission power can only be used by a single party at a time, or a single party in a divisible context, if owned or used at all. Thus far or usually those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_can_be_property.3F">What can be property?</span></h3>
<p>The two major justifications given for original property, or the <a href="/wiki/Homestead_principle" title="Homestead principle">homestead principle</a>, are <b>effort</b> and <b>scarcity</b>. <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> emphasized effort, "mixing your labor" with an object, or clearing and cultivating virgin land. <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Tucker" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> preferred to look at the <a href="/wiki/Telos_(philosophy)" title="Telos (philosophy)">telos</a> of property, i.e. What is the purpose of property? His answer: to solve the scarcity problem. Only when items are relatively scarce with respect to people's desires do they become property. For example, hunter-gatherers did not consider land to be property, since there was no shortage of land. Agrarian societies later made arable land property, as it was scarce. For something to be economically scarce it must necessarily have the <i>exclusivity property</i>—that use by one person excludes others from using it. These two justifications lead to different conclusions on what can be property. <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">Intellectual property</a>—incorporeal things like ideas, plans, orderings and arrangements (musical compositions, novels, computer programs)—are generally considered valid property to those who support an effort justification, but invalid to those who support a scarcity justification, since the things don't have the exclusivity property (however, those who support a scarcity justification may still support other "intellectual property" laws such as <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">Copyright</a>, as long as these are a subject of <a href="/wiki/Contract" title="Contract">contract</a> instead of government arbitration). Thus even ardent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Propertarian" title="Propertarian">propertarians</a> may disagree about IP. By either standard, one's body is one's property.</p>
<p>From some <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchist</a> points of view, the validity of property depends on whether the "property right" requires enforcement by the state. Different forms of "property" require different amounts of enforcement: <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> requires a great deal of state intervention to enforce, ownership of distant physical property requires quite a lot, ownership of carried objects requires very little, while ownership of one's own body requires absolutely no state intervention. Some <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> don't believe in property at all.</p>
<p>Many things have existed that did not have an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Owner" title="Owner">owner</a>, sometimes called the <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons">commons</a>. The term "commons," however, is also often used to mean something quite different: "general collective ownership"—i.e. <a href="/wiki/Common_ownership" title="Common ownership">common ownership</a>. Also, the same term is sometimes used by <a href="/wiki/Statism" title="Statism">statists</a> to mean government-owned property that the general public is allowed to access (<a href="/wiki/Public_property" title="Public property">public property</a>). Law in all societies has tended to develop towards reducing the number of things not having clear owners. Supporters of property rights argue that this enables better protection of scarce resources, due to the <a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>, while critics argue that it leads to the 'exploitation' of those resources for personal gain and that it hinders taking advantage of potential <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Network_effects" title="Network effects">network effects</a>. These arguments have differing validity for different types of "property"—things that are not scarce are, for instance, not subject to the <a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. Some apparent critics advocate general collective ownership rather than ownerlessness.</p>
<p>Things that do not have owners include: <a href="/wiki/Idea" title="Idea">ideas</a> (except for <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a>), <a href="/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">seawater</a> (which is, however, protected by anti-pollution laws), parts of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seafloor" title="Seafloor">seafloor</a> (see the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" title="United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> for restrictions), gases in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, animals in the wild (although in most nations, animals are tied to the land. In the United States and Canada wildlife are generally defined in statute as property of the state. This public ownership of wildlife is referred to as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and is based on The Public Trust Doctrine.), celestial bodies and outer space, and land in <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>.</p>
<p>The nature of children under the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_majority" title="Age of majority">age of majority</a> is another contested issue here. In ancient societies children were generally considered the property of their parents. Children in most modern societies theoretically own their own bodies but are not considered competent to exercise their rights, and their parents or <a href="/wiki/Legal_guardian" title="Legal guardian">guardians</a> are given most of the actual rights of control over them.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the nature of ownership of the body also come up in the issue of <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drugs" title="Drugs">drugs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Euthanasia" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a>.</p>
<p>In many ancient legal systems (e.g. early <a href="/wiki/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman law</a>), religious sites (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Temple" title="Temple">temples</a>) were considered property of the <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a> or gods they were devoted to. However, <a href="/wiki/Religious_pluralism" title="Religious pluralism">religious pluralism</a> makes it more convenient to have religious sites owned by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_body" title="Religious body">religious body</a> that runs them.</p>

<p>Ownership laws may vary widely among countries depending on the nature of the property of interest (e.g. firearms, real property, personal property, animals). Persons can own property directly. In most societies <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Juristic_person" title="Juristic person">legal entities</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corporations" title="Corporations">corporations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trust_law" title="Trust law">trusts</a> and nations (or governments) own property.</p>
<p>In many countries women have limited access to property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal rights to own property.</p>
<p>In the Inca empire, the dead emperors, who were considered gods, still controlled property after death.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Whether_and_to_what_extent_the_state_may_interfere_with_property">Whether and to what extent the state may interfere with property</span></h3>
<p>Under <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> law the principal limitations on whether and the extent to which the State may interfere with property rights are set by the Constitution. The "Takings" clause requires that the government (whether state or federal—for the 14th Amendment's due process clause imposes the 5th Amendment's takings clause on state governments) may take private property only for a public purpose, after exercising due process of law, and upon making "just compensation." If an interest is not deemed a "property" right or the conduct is merely an intentional tort, these limitations do not apply and the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_immunity" title="Sovereign immunity">sovereign immunity</a> precludes relief. Moreover, if the interference does not almost completely make the property valueless, the interference will not be deemed a taking but instead a mere regulation of use. On the other hand, some governmental regulations of property use have been deemed so severe that they have been considered "<a href="/wiki/Regulatory_taking" title="Regulatory taking">regulatory takings</a>." Moreover, conduct sometimes deemed only a nuisance or other tort has been held a taking of property where the conduct was sufficiently persistent and severe.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Theories_of_property">Theories of property</span></h2>
<p>There exist many theories of property. One is the relatively rare <a href="/wiki/First_possession_theory_of_property" title="First possession theory of property">first possession theory of property</a>, where ownership of something is seen as justified simply by someone seizing something before someone else does. Perhaps one of the most popular is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_rights" title="Natural rights">natural rights</a> definition of property rights as advanced by <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>. Locke advanced the theory that God granted dominion over nature to man through Adam in the book of Genesis. Therefore, he theorized that when one mixes one’s labor with nature, one gains a relationship with that part of nature with which the labor is mixed, subject to the limitation that there should be "enough, and as good, left in common for others." (see <a href="/wiki/Lockean_proviso" title="Lockean proviso">Lockean proviso</a>)</p>
<p>From the RERUM NOVARUM, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII" title="Pope Leo XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> wrote "It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and thereafter to hold it as his very own."</p>
<p>Anthropology studies the diverse systems of ownership, rights of use and transfer, and possession under the term "theories of property." Western legal theory is based, as mentioned, on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.</p>
<p>In every culture studied ownership and possession are the subject of custom and regulation, and "law" where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual ownership with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Sec. 2. The lands of the Cherokee Nation shall remain common property; but the improvements made thereon, and in the possession of the citizens respectively who made, or may rightfully be in possession of them: Provided, that the citizens of the Nation possessing exclusive and indefeasible right to their improvements, as expressed in this article, shall possess no right or power to dispose of their improvements, in any manner whatever, to the United States, individual States, or to individual citizens thereof; and that, whenever any citizen shall remove with his effects out of the limits of this Nation, and become a citizen of any other government, all his rights and privileges as a citizen of this Nation shall cease: Provided, nevertheless, That the National Council shall have power to re-admit, by law, to all the rights of citizenship, any such person or persons who may, at any time, desire to return to the Nation, on memorializing the National Council for such readmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principal writings of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> appeared between 1640 and 1651—during and immediately following <a href="/wiki/First_English_Civil_War" title="First English Civil War">the war between forces</a> loyal to King <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> and those loyal to <a href="/wiki/Parliament" title="Parliament">Parliament</a>. In his own words, Hobbes' reflection began with the idea of "giving to every man his own," a phrase he drew from the writings of <a href="/wiki/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a>. But he wondered: How can anybody call anything his own? He concluded: My own can only truly be mine if there is one unambiguously strongest power in the realm, and that power treats it as mine, protecting its status as such.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="James_Harrington_.2817th_century.29">James Harrington (17th century)</span></h4>
<p>A contemporary of Hobbes, <a href="/wiki/James_Harrington_(author)" title="James Harrington (author)">James Harrington</a>, reacted to the same tumult in a different way: he considered property natural but not inevitable. The author of <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Oceana_(book)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Oceana (book) (page does not exist)">Oceana</a></i>, he may have been the first political theorist to postulate that political power is a consequence, not the cause, of the distribution of property. He said that the worst possible situation is one in which the commoners have half a nation's property, with crown and nobility holding the other half—a circumstance fraught with instability and violence. A much better situation (a stable republic) will exist once the commoners own most property, he suggested.</p>
<p>In later years, the ranks of Harrington's admirers included American revolutionary and founder <a href="/wiki/John_Adams" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Robert_Filmer_.2817th_century.29">Robert Filmer (17th century)</span></h4>
<p>Another member of the Hobbes/Harrington generation, Sir <a href="/wiki/Robert_Filmer" title="Robert Filmer">Robert Filmer</a>, reached conclusions much like Hobbes', but through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biblical" title="Biblical">Biblical</a> <a href="/wiki/Exegesis" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a>. Filmer said that the institution of kingship is analogous to that of fatherhood, that subjects are but children, whether obedient or unruly, and that property rights are akin to the household goods that a father may dole out among his children—his to take back and dispose of according to his pleasure.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="John_Locke_.2817th_century.29">John Locke (17th century)</span></h4>
<p>In the following generation, <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> sought to answer Filmer, creating a rationale for a balanced <a href="/wiki/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a> in which the monarch had a part to play, but not an overwhelming part. Since Filmer's views essentially require that the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Stuart" title="House of Stuart">Stuart</a> family be uniquely descended from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Patriarchs" title="Patriarchs">patriarchs</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>, and since even in the late 17th century that was a difficult view to uphold, Locke attacked Filmer's views in his <a href="/wiki/Two_Treatises_of_Government#First_Treatise" title="Two Treatises of Government">First Treatise on Government</a>, freeing him to set out his own views in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Treatise_on_Civil_Government" title="Second Treatise on Civil Government">Second Treatise on Civil Government</a>. Therein, Locke imagined a pre-social world, each of the unhappy residents of which are willing to create a <a href="/wiki/Social_contract" title="Social contract">social contract</a> because otherwise "the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure," and therefore the "great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property." They would, he allowed, create a <a href="/wiki/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, but its task would be to execute the will of an elected legislature. "To this end" (to achieve the previously specified goal), he wrote, "it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into, and the community put the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legislative_power" title="Legislative power">legislative power</a> into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the <a href="/wiki/State_of_nature" title="State of nature">state of nature</a>."</p>
<p>Even when it keeps to proper legislative form, though, Locke held that there are limits to what a government established by such a contract might rightly do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It cannot be supposed that [the hypothetical contractors] they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that both "persons <i>and</i> estates" are to be protected from the arbitrary power of any magistrate, inclusive of the "power and will of a legislator." In Lockean terms, depredations against an estate are just as plausible a justification for resistance and revolution as are those against persons. In neither case are subjects required to allow themselves to become prey.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="David_Hume_.2818th_century.29">David Hume (18th century)</span></h4>
<p>In contrast to the figures discussed in this section thus far <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> lived a relatively quiet life that had settled down to a relatively stable social and political structure. He lived the life of a solitary writer until 1763 when, at 52 years of age, he went off to <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> to work at the British embassy.</p>
<p>In contrast, one might think, to his polemical works on <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a>-driven <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism" title="Philosophical skepticism">skeptical</a> <a href="/wiki/Epistemology" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a>, Hume's views on law and property were quite conservative.</p>
<p>He did not believe in hypothetical contracts, or in the love of mankind in general, and sought to ground politics upon actual human beings as one knows them. "In general," he wrote, "it may be affirmed that there is no such passion in human mind, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, or services, or of relation to ourselves." Existing customs should not lightly be disregarded, because they have come to be what they are as a result of human nature. With this endorsement of custom comes an endorsement of existing governments, because he conceived of the two as complementary: "A regard for <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a>, though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subordinate to a reverence for established <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a>."</p>
<p>Therefore, Hume's view was that there are property rights because of and to the extent that the existing law, supported by social customs, secure them. He offered some practical home-spun advice on the general subject, though, as when he referred to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avarice" title="Avarice">avarice</a> as "the spur of <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a>," and expressed concern about excessive levels of taxation, which "destroy industry, by engendering despair."</p>

<p>"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive." - (Source: <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" title="The Wealth of Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a></i>, 1776, Book I, Chapter X, Part II.)</p>
<p>By the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States, and had begun in France. The established conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods in general. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.</p>

<p>Section VIII, "<a href="/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital" title="Primitive accumulation of capital">Primitive Accumulation</a>" of Capital involves a critique of Liberal Theories of property rights. Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally as entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, which were then seized by the aristocracy. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures (sheep heading). Marx sees this "Primitive Accumulation as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a large unlanded class which had to work for wages in order to survive. Marx asserts that Liberal theories of property are "idyllic" fairy tales that hide a violent historical process.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Charles_Comte_.E2.80.93_legitimate_origin_of_property">Charles Comte – legitimate origin of property</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Charles_Comte" title="Charles Comte">Charles Comte</a>, in <i>Traité de la propriété</i> (1834), attempted to justify the legitimacy of private property in response to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bourbon_Dynasty,_Restored" title="Bourbon Dynasty, Restored">Bourbon Restoration</a>. According to David Hart, Comte had three main points: "firstly, that interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity; secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone; and thirdly, that historically some, but by no means all, property which has evolved has done so legitimately, with the implication that the present distribution of property is a complex mixture of legitimately and illegitimately held titles."</p>
<p>Comte, as Proudhon later did, rejected <a href="/wiki/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman legal tradition</a> with its toleration of slavery. He posited a communal "national" property consisting of non-scarce goods, such as land in ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Since agriculture was so much more efficient than hunting and gathering, private property appropriated by someone for farming left remaining hunter-gatherers with more land per person, and hence did not harm them. Thus this type of land appropriation did not violate the <a href="/wiki/Lockean_proviso" title="Lockean proviso">Lockean proviso</a> – there was "still enough, and as good left." Comte's analysis would be used by later theorists in response to the socialist critique on property.</p>

<p>In his 1849 treatise <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/What_is_Property%3F" title="What is Property?">What is Property?</a></i>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pierre_Proudhon" title="Pierre Proudhon">Pierre Proudhon</a> answers with "<a href="/wiki/Property_is_theft!" title="Property is theft!">Property is theft!</a>" In natural resources, he sees two types of property, <i>de jure</i> property (legal title) and <i>de facto</i> property (physical possession), and argues that the former is illegitimate. Proudhon's conclusion is that "property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition."</p>
<p>His analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property (usufruct) is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of mankind with the product of labor being the property of the producer. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of labor to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create and therefore did not own.</p>
<p>Proudhon's theory of property greatly influenced the budding socialist movement, inspiring anarchist theorists such as <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> who modified Proudhon's ideas, as well as antagonizing theorists like <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fr.C3.A9d.C3.A9ric_Bastiat_.E2.80.93_property_is_value">Frédéric Bastiat – property is value</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Bastiat" title="Frédéric Bastiat">Frédéric Bastiat</a>'s main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book <i>Economic Harmonies</i> (1850). In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people with respect to an object. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for <i>I may justly gift or trade this water to another person</i>. In essence, what one owns is not the object but the value of the object. By "value," Bastiat apparently means <i>market value</i>; he emphasizes that this is quite different from utility. <i>"In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but of their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services."</i></p>
<p>Bastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g. 100 liters of wheat decreases over time, thus amounting to "gratis" satisfaction. Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of mankind. <i>"Since the human race started from the point of greatest poverty, that is, from the point where there were the most obstacles to be overcome, it is clear that all that has been gained from one era to the next has been due to the spirit of property."</i></p>
<p>This transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that private property will ever totally disappear. This is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Andrew_J._Galambos_.E2.80.93_A_Precise_Definition_of_Property">Andrew J. Galambos – A Precise Definition of Property</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Andrew_Joseph_Galambos" title="Andrew Joseph Galambos">Andrew J. Galambos</a> (1924–1997) was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. Galambos’ concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a man’s life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life. (Because the English language is deficient in omitting the feminine from “man” when referring to humankind, it is implicit and obligatory that the feminine is included in the term “man”.)</p>
<p>Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: “Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property.” Galambos defines property as having the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Primordial property</b>, which is an individual’s life</li>
<li><b>Primary property</b>, which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions</li>
<li><b>Secondary property</b>, which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individual's primary property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual’s life; this means children are not the property of their parents. and "primary property" (a person's own ideas).</p>
<p>Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property. For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual’s money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person’s primordial property.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Contemporary_views">Contemporary views</span></h3>
<p>Contemporary political thinkers who believe that natural persons enjoy rights to own property and to enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as <a href="/wiki/William_Harold_Hutt" title="William Harold Hutt">W.H. Hutt</a> (1956), who praised Locke for laying down the "quintessence of individualism". On the other hand, those such as <a href="/wiki/Richard_Pipes" title="Richard Pipes">Richard Pipes</a> regard Locke's arguments as weak, and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Locke's work "marked a regression because it rested on the concept of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_Law" title="Natural Law">Natural Law</a>" rather than upon Harrington's sociological framework.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hernando_de_Soto_(economist)" title="Hernando de Soto (economist)">Hernando de Soto</a> has argued that an important characteristic of capitalist market economy is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Property_system&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Property system (page does not exist)">property system</a> which clearly records ownership and transactions. These property rights and the whole formal system of property make possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater independence for individuals from local community arrangements to protect their assets</li>
<li>Clear, provable, and protectable ownership</li>
<li>The standardization and integration of property rules and property information in a country as a whole</li>
<li>Increased trust arising from a greater certainty of punishment for cheating in economic transactions</li>
<li>More formal and complex written statements of ownership that permit the easier assumption of shared risk and ownership in companies, and insurance against risk</li>
<li>Greater availability of loans for new projects, since more things can serve as collateral for the loans</li>
<li>Easier access to and more reliable information regarding such things as credit history and the worth of assets</li>
<li>Increased <a href="/wiki/Fungibility" title="Fungibility">fungibility</a>, standardization and transferability of statements documenting the ownership of property, which paves the way for structures such as national markets for companies and the easy transportation of property through complex networks of individuals and other entities</li>
