<p>The <b>Internet</b> is the global system of interconnected <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">networks</a> that use the <a href="/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" title="Internet protocol suite">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a <i>network of networks</i> that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked <a href="/wiki/Hypertext" title="Hypertext">hypertext</a> documents and <a href="/wiki/Web_application" title="Web application">applications</a> of the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> (WWW), <a href="/wiki/Email" title="Email">electronic mail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Voice_over_IP" title="Voice over IP">telephony</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networks for <a href="/wiki/File_sharing" title="File sharing">file sharing</a>.</p>
<p>The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">United States federal government</a> in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. The primary precursor network, the <a href="/wiki/ARPANET" title="ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s. The funding of the <a href="/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network" title="National Science Foundation Network">National Science Foundation Network</a> as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mobile_device" title="Mobile device">mobile</a> computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by <a href="/wiki/Academia" title="Academia">academia</a> since the 1980s, the <a href="/wiki/Commercialization_of_the_Internet" title="Commercialization of the Internet">commercialization</a> incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.</p>
<p>Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s and from the late 1990s in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_world" title="Developing world">developing world</a>. In the 20 years since 1995, Internet use has grown 100-times, measured for the period of one year, to over one third of the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world population</a>. Most traditional communications media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as <a href="/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_telephony" title="Internet telephony">Internet telephony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Internet_television" title="Internet television">Internet television</a> music, digital newspapers, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Video_streaming" title="Video streaming">video streaming</a> websites.

<p>The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Name_space" title="Name space">name spaces</a> in the Internet, the <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">Internet Protocol address</a> space and the <a href="/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_Corporation_for_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers" title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN).

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Capitalization_of_%22Internet%22" title='Capitalization of "Internet"'>Capitalization of "Internet"</a></div>
<p>The term <i>Internet</i>, when used to refer to the specific global system of interconnected <a href="/wiki/Internet_Protocol" title="Internet Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) networks, is a <a href="/wiki/Proper_noun" title="Proper noun">proper noun</a> and may be written with an initial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capital_letter" title="Capital letter">capital letter</a>. In common use and the media, it is often not capitalized, viz. <i>the internet.</i> Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. The Internet is also often referred to as <i>the Net</i>, as a short form of <i>network</i>. Historically, as early as 1849, the word <i>internetted</i> was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning <i>interconnected</i> or <i>interwoven</i>. The designers of early computer networks used <i>internet</i> both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internetwork" title="Internetwork">internetwork</a> or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks.</p>
<p>The terms <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i> are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of "<i>going on the Internet</i>" when invoking a <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browser</a> to view <a href="/wiki/Web_page" title="Web page">web pages</a>. However, the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> or <i>the Web</i> is only one of a large number of Internet services. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other <a href="/wiki/Web_resource" title="Web resource">web resources</a>, linked by <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink" title="Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator" title="Uniform resource locator">URLs</a>. As another point of comparison, <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a>, or HTTP, is the language used on the Web for information transfer, yet it is just one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.

<p>Research into <a href="/wiki/Packet_switching" title="Packet switching">packet switching</a> started in the early 1960s, and packet switched networks such as the <a href="/wiki/ARPANET" title="ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, <a href="/wiki/CYCLADES" title="CYCLADES">CYCLADES</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Merit_Network" title="Merit Network">Merit Network</a>, <a href="/wiki/NPL_network" title="NPL network">NPL network</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tymnet" title="Tymnet">Tymnet</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Telenet" title="Telenet">Telenet</a>, were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of <a href="/wiki/Communications_protocol" title="Communications protocol">protocols</a>. The ARPANET project led to the development of protocols for <a href="/wiki/Internetworking" title="Internetworking">internetworking</a>, by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks. ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the Network Measurement Center at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="University of California, Los Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a> (UCLA) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Henry_Samueli_School_of_Engineering_and_Applied_Science" title="Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science">Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> directed by <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Kleinrock" title="Leonard Kleinrock">Leonard Kleinrock</a>, and the NLS system at <a href="/wiki/SRI_International" title="SRI International">SRI International</a> (SRI) by <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart" title="Douglas Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a> in <a href="/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California" title="Menlo Park, California">Menlo Park</a>, California, on 29 October 1969. The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara" title="University of California, Santa Barbara">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, followed by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Utah" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, fifteen sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971. These early years were documented in the 1972 film <i><a href="/wiki/Computer_Networks:_The_Heralds_of_Resource_Sharing" title="Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing">Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing</a></i>.</p>
<p>Early international collaborations on the ARPANET were rare. European developers were concerned with developing the <a href="/wiki/X.25" title="X.25">X.25</a> networks. Notable exceptions were the Norwegian Seismic Array (<a href="/wiki/NORSAR" title="NORSAR">NORSAR</a>) in June 1973, followed in 1973 by Sweden with satellite links to the <a href="/wiki/Tanum_Municipality" title="Tanum Municipality">Tanum</a> Earth Station and <a href="/wiki/Peter_T._Kirstein" title="Peter T. Kirstein">Peter T.

In December 1974, <a class="external mw-magiclink-rfc" href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675" rel="nofollow">RFC 675</a> (<i>Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program</i>), by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, used the term <i>internet</i> as a shorthand for <i>internetworking</i> and later <a href="/wiki/Request_for_Comments" title="Request for Comments">RFCs</a> repeated this use. Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the <a href="/wiki/National_Science_Foundation" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) funded the <a href="/wiki/CSNET" title="CSNET">Computer Science Network</a> (CSNET). In 1982, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite" title="Internet Protocol Suite">Internet Protocol Suite</a> (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks.</p>

<p>TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the <a href="/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network" title="National Science Foundation Network">National Science Foundation Network</a> (NSFNet) provided access to <a href="/wiki/Supercomputer" title="Supercomputer">supercomputer</a> sites in the United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s. Commercial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_service_providers" title="Internet service providers">Internet service providers</a> (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic. The Internet rapidly expanded in Europe and Australia in the mid to late 1980s and to Asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The beginning of dedicated <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transatlantic" title="wikt:transatlantic">transatlantic</a> communication between the NSFNET and networks in Europe was established with a low-speed satellite relay between <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stockholm,_Sweden" title="Stockholm, Sweden">Stockholm, Sweden</a> in December 1988. Although other network protocols such as <a href="/wiki/UUCP" title="UUCP">UUCP</a> had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network.</p>
<p>Slightly over a year later in March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> and <a href="/wiki/CERN" title="CERN">CERN</a>, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites. Six months later <a href="/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> would begin writing <a href="/wiki/WorldWideWeb" title="WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb</a>, the first <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browser</a> after two years of lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HyperText_Transfer_Protocol" title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP) 0.9, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language" title="HyperText Markup Language">HyperText Markup Language</a> (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also a <a href="/wiki/HTML_editor" title="HTML editor">HTML editor</a> and could access <a href="/wiki/Usenet" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroups and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FTP" title="FTP">FTP</a> files), the first HTTP <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Server_application" title="Server application">server software</a> (later known as <a href="/wiki/CERN_httpd" title="CERN httpd">CERN httpd</a>), the first <a href="/wiki/Web_server" title="Web server">web server</a> (<a class="external free" href="http://info.cern.ch" rel="nofollow">http://info.cern.ch</a>), and the first Web pages that described the project itself. Public commercial use of the Internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of MCI Mail and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compuserve" title="Compuserve">Compuserve</a>'s email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the Internet.  Just months later on January 1, 1990, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=PSInet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="PSInet (page does not exist)">PSInet</a> launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that would grow into the commercial Internet we know today. In 1991 the <a href="/wiki/Commercial_Internet_eXchange" title="Commercial Internet eXchange">Commercial Internet eXchange</a> was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Since 1995 the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, <a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a>, telephony (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol" title="Voice over Internet Protocol">Voice over Internet Protocol</a> or VoIP), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Video_chat" title="Video chat">two-way interactive video calls</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> with its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Discussion_forums" title="Discussion forums">discussion forums</a>, blogs, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_networking" title="Social networking">social networking</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Online_shopping" title="Online shopping">online shopping</a> sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.</p>

<p>The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_networking" title="Social networking">social networking</a>. During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%. This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network. As of 31 March 2011, the estimated total number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_users" title="Internet users">Internet users</a> was 2.095 billion (30.2% of world population). It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication, by 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet.</p>

Various terms are used, such as <i>public Internet kiosk</i>, <i>public access terminal</i>, and <i>Web <a href="/wiki/Payphone" title="Payphone">payphone</a></i>. Many hotels also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. <a href="/wiki/Hotspot_(Wi-Fi)" title="Hotspot (Wi-Fi)">Hotspots</a> providing such access include <a href="/wiki/Wi-Fi#Internet_access" title="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi cafes</a>, where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_Digital_Assistant" title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</a>. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Grassroots" title="Grassroots">Grassroots</a> efforts have led to <a href="/wiki/Wireless_community_network" title="Wireless community network">wireless community networks</a>. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a>, <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench. Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like <a href="/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)" title="Ricochet (Internet service)">Ricochet</a>, various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a> in general come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as <a href="/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)" title="Opera (web browser)">Opera</a> are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used. An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure">Structure</span></h3>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer scientists</a> describe the Internet as a "prime example of a large-scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system". The structure was found to be highly robust to random failures, yet, very vulnerable to intentional attacks. The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively and the possibility of developing alternative structures has been investigated.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Protocols">Protocols</span></h2>

<p>While the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF). The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as <i><a href="/wiki/Request_for_Comments" title="Request for Comments">Request for Comments</a></i> (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Standard" title="Internet Standard">Internet Standards</a>. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.</p>
<p>The Internet standards describe a framework known as the <a href="/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" title="Internet protocol suite">Internet protocol suite</a>. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in <a class="external mw-magiclink-rfc" href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122" rel="nofollow">RFC 1122</a> and <a class="external mw-magiclink-rfc" href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123" rel="nofollow">RFC 1123</a>. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the <a href="/wiki/Application_layer" title="Application layer">application layer</a>, space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Client-server" title="Client-server">client-server</a> application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> paradigm. Below this top layer, the <a href="/wiki/Transport_layer" title="Transport layer">transport layer</a> connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.</p>
<p>Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and hosts via the physical connections. The <a href="/wiki/Internet_layer" title="Internet layer">Internet layer</a> enables computers to identify and locate each other via <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">Internet Protocol (IP) addresses</a>, and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture is the <a href="/wiki/Link_layer" title="Link layer">link layer</a>, which provides connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a physical connection in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Local_area_network" title="Local area network">local area network</a> (LAN) or a <a href="/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access" title="Dial-up Internet access">dial-up connection</a>. The model, also known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TCP/IP" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>, is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware, which the model, therefore, does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the <a href="/wiki/OSI_model" title="OSI model">OSI model</a>, that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation; indeed, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.</p>

<p>The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems (<a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">IP addresses</a>) for computers on the Internet. IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. <a href="/wiki/IPv4" title="IPv4">Internet Protocol Version 4</a> (IPv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (10) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to <a href="/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion" title="IPv4 address exhaustion">IPv4 address exhaustion</a>, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. <a href="/wiki/IPv6" title="IPv6">IPv6</a> is currently in growing <a href="/wiki/IPv6_deployment" title="IPv6 deployment">deployment</a> around the world, since Internet address registries (<a href="/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry" title="Regional Internet registry">RIRs</a>) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.</p>
<p>IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, is still lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peering_agreement" title="Peering agreement">peering agreements</a>, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Services">Services</span></h2>
<p>The Internet carries many <a href="/wiki/Network_service" title="Network service">network services</a>, most prominently <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mobile_apps" title="Mobile apps">mobile apps</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Social_media" title="Social media">social media</a> apps, the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_mail" title="Electronic mail">electronic mail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Multiplayer_online_game" title="Multiplayer online game">multiplayer online games</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_telephony" title="Internet telephony">Internet telephony</a>, and <a href="/wiki/File_sharing" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> services.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</span></h3>

<p>Many people use the terms <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i>, or just the <i>Web</i>, interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. The <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> is the primary application that billions of people use on the Internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably. However, the Internet provides many other services. The Web is a global set of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Documents" title="Documents">documents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_graphics" title="Computer graphics">images</a> and other resources, logically interrelated by <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink" title="Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> and referenced with <a href="/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" title="Uniform Resource Identifier">Uniform Resource Identifiers</a> (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_servers" title="Web servers">servers</a>, and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. <a href="/wiki/Web_service" title="Web service">Web services</a> also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.</p>
<p>World Wide Web browser software, such as <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Internet_Explorer" title="Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)" title="Opera (web browser)">Opera</a>, <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)" title="Safari (web browser)">Safari</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Google_Chrome" title="Google Chrome">Google Chrome</a>, lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_data" title="Computer data">computer data</a>, including graphics, sounds, <a href="/wiki/Plain_text" title="Plain text">text</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_video" title="Web video">video</a>, <a href="/wiki/Multimedia" title="Multimedia">multimedia</a> and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. <a href="/wiki/Client-side_scripting" title="Client-side scripting">Client-side software</a> can include animations, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_game" title="Web game">games</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Office_applications" title="Office applications">office applications</a> and scientific demonstrations. Through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keyword_(Internet_search)" title="Keyword (Internet search)">keyword</a>-driven <a href="/wiki/Internet_research" title="Internet research">Internet research</a> using <a href="/wiki/Web_search_engine" title="Web search engine">search engines</a> like <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!_Search" title="Yahoo! Search">Yahoo!</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Google_(search_engine)" title="Google (search engine)">Google</a>, users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.</p>
<p>The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Publish" title="Publish">publish</a> ideas and information to a potentially large <a href="/wiki/Audience" title="Audience">audience</a> online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial <a href="/wiki/Cost" title="Cost">cost</a> and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use <i>web logs</i> or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Employees" title="Employees">staff</a> to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.</p>
<p>One example of this practice is <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, whose <a href="/wiki/Software_developer" title="Software developer">product developers</a> publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work. Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as <a href="/wiki/Angelfire" title="Angelfire">Angelfire</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GeoCities" title="GeoCities">GeoCities</a> have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_network_service" title="Social network service">social network services</a> rather than simply as web page hosts.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Online_advertising" title="Online advertising">Advertising</a> on popular web pages can be lucrative, and <a href="/wiki/E-commerce" title="E-commerce">e-commerce</a> or the sale of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of <a href="/wiki/Marketing" title="Marketing">marketing</a> and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver <a href="/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)" title="Promotion (marketing)">promotional</a> marketing messages to consumers. It includes email marketing, <a href="/wiki/Search_engine_marketing" title="Search engine marketing">search engine marketing</a> (SEM), social media marketing, many types of <a href="/wiki/Display_advertising" title="Display advertising">display advertising</a> (including <a href="/wiki/Web_banner" title="Web banner">web banner</a> advertising), and <a href="/wiki/Mobile_advertising" title="Mobile advertising">mobile advertising</a>. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of <a href="/wiki/Cable_television" title="Cable television">cable television</a> and nearly exceeded those of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Broadcast_television" title="Broadcast television">broadcast television</a>. Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.</p>
<p>When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in <a href="/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a>, complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using <a href="/wiki/Content_management" title="Content management">content management</a> software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Communication">Communication</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Email" title="Email">Email</a> is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as <a href="/wiki/Email_attachment" title="Email attachment">email attachments</a>. Emails can be <a href="/wiki/Carbon_copy" title="Carbon copy">cc-ed</a> to multiple <a href="/wiki/Email_address" title="Email address">email addresses</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_telephony" title="Internet telephony">Internet telephony</a> is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VoIP" title="VoIP">VoIP</a> stands for Voice-over-<a href="/wiki/Internet_Protocol" title="Internet Protocol">Internet Protocol</a>, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with <a href="/wiki/Walkie-talkie" title="Walkie-talkie">walkie-talkie</a>-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as <a href="/wiki/Cable_modem" title="Cable modem">cable</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ADSL" title="ADSL">ADSL</a>. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.</p>
<p>Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include <a href="/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number" title="Emergency telephone number">emergency telephone number</a> dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no "extra features" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a <a href="/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply" title="Uninterruptible power supply">backup power source</a> for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include <a href="/wiki/Ventrilo" title="Ventrilo">Ventrilo</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Teamspeak" title="Teamspeak">Teamspeak</a>. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Data_transfer">Data transfer</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/File_sharing" title="File sharing">File sharing</a> is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A <a href="/wiki/Computer_file" title="Computer file">computer file</a> can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or <a href="/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" title="File Transfer Protocol">File Transfer Protocol</a> (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a <a href="/wiki/File_server" title="File server">file server</a> for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_mirror" title="Web mirror">mirror</a>" servers or <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">authentication</a>, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a>, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed – usually fully encrypted – across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by <a href="/wiki/Digital_signature" title="Digital signature">digital signatures</a> or by <a href="/wiki/MD5" title="MD5">MD5</a> or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Streaming_media" title="Streaming media">Streaming media</a> is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical <a href="/wiki/Webcast" title="Webcast">webcasts</a> to on-demand popular multimedia services. <a href="/wiki/Podcast" title="Podcast">Podcasting</a> is a variation on this theme, where – usually audio – material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a <a href="/wiki/Portable_media_player" title="Portable media player">portable media player</a> to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.</p>
<p>Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Webcam" title="Webcam">Webcams</a> are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chat_rooms" title="Chat rooms">chat rooms</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Video_conferencing" title="Video conferencing">video conferencing</a> are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a <a href="/wiki/Adobe_Flash" title="Adobe Flash">flash</a>-based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily. Currently, YouTube also uses an <a href="/wiki/HTML5" title="HTML5">HTML5</a> player.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_impact">Social impact</span></h2>

<p>Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion. By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>. In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population, but two-thirds of the users came from richest countries, with 78.0 percent of Europe countries population using the Internet, followed by 57.4 percent of the Americas.</p>
<p>The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a <a href="/wiki/Lingua_franca" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a>. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the <a href="/wiki/ASCII" title="ASCII">American Standard Code for Information Interchange</a> (ASCII), a subset of the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>.</p>
<p>After English (27%), the most requested languages on the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%). By region, 42% of the world's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_users" title="Internet users">Internet users</a> are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> taken together, 6% in Africa, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania. The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of <a href="/wiki/Unicode" title="Unicode">Unicode</a>, that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as <i><a href="/wiki/Mojibake" title="Mojibake">mojibake</a></i> (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.</p>
<p>In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking. More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age. In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more. In terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog.</p>
<p>According to forecasts by <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Euromonitor_International&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Euromonitor International (page does not exist)">Euromonitor International</a>, 44% of the world's population will be users of the Internet by 2020.

Mobile phones, <a href="/wiki/Datacard" title="Datacard">datacards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Handheld_game_console" title="Handheld game console">handheld game consoles</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cellular_router" title="Cellular router">cellular routers</a> allow users to connect to the Internet <a href="/wiki/Wireless" title="Wireless">wirelessly</a>. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.</p>
<p>Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from <a href="/wiki/CBeebies" title="CBeebies">CBeebies</a>, through school and high-school revision guides and <a href="/wiki/Virtual_university" title="Virtual university">virtual universities</a>, to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of <a href="/wiki/Google_Scholar" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>. For <a href="/wiki/Distance_education" title="Distance education">distance education</a>, help with <a href="/wiki/Homework" title="Homework">homework</a> and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> in particular are important enablers of both <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">formal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Informal_education" title="Informal education">informal education</a>. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.</p>
<p>The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made <a href="/wiki/Collaboration" title="Collaboration">collaborative</a> work dramatically easier, with the help of <a href="/wiki/Collaborative_software" title="Collaborative software">collaborative software</a>. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the <a href="/wiki/Free_software_movement" title="Free software movement">free software movement</a>, which has produced, among other things, <a href="/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, and <a href="/wiki/OpenOffice.org" title="OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>.

Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Content_management" title="Content management">Content management</a> systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and <a href="/wiki/Computer_literacy" title="Computer literacy">computer literacy</a> spread.</p>
<p>The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with <a href="/wiki/Computer_security" title="Computer security">computer security</a>, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can <a href="/wiki/Audit" title="Audit">audit</a> the books of a company based in another country, on a <a href="/wiki/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">server</a> situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private <a href="/wiki/Leased_line" title="Leased line">leased lines</a> would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using <a href="/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="Cloud computing">cloud computing</a>, or open a <a href="/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol" title="Remote Desktop Protocol">remote desktop</a> session into their office PC using a secure <a href="/wiki/Virtual_private_network" title="Virtual private network">virtual private network</a> (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among <a href="/wiki/System_administrator" title="System administrator">system administrators</a> as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.</p>

<p>Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use <a href="/wiki/Online_chat" title="Online chat">chat</a>, messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had <a href="/wiki/Pen_pal" title="Pen pal">pen pals</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_network_service" title="Social network service">Social networking</a> websites such as <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Myspace" title="Myspace">Myspace</a> have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like <a href="/wiki/LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and <a href="/wiki/Flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to "<a href="/wiki/Viral_marketing" title="Viral marketing">go viral</a>". "Black hat" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as <a href="/wiki/Spamming" title="Spamming">spam</a> accounts and <a href="/wiki/Astroturfing" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>.</p>
<p>A risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial <i>offline</i> behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and <a href="/wiki/Hate_speech" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>, to, in extreme cases, rape and death <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_crime#Threats" title="Computer crime">threats</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect" title="Online disinhibition effect">online disinhibition effect</a> describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feminist" title="Feminist">feminist</a> women have been the target of various forms of <a href="/wiki/Harassment" title="Harassment">harassment</a> in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.</p>
<p>For organizations, such a backlash can cause overall <a href="/wiki/Public_relations" title="Public relations">brand damage</a>, especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.</p>
<p>Some websites, such as <a href="/wiki/Reddit" title="Reddit">Reddit</a>, have rules forbidding the posting of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_information" title="Personal information">personal information</a> of individuals (also known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Doxxing" title="Doxxing">doxxing</a>), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Censored" title="Censored">censored</a> in Facebook <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Screenshots" title="Screenshots">screenshots</a> posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.</p>
<p>Children also face dangers online such as <a href="/wiki/Cyberbullying" title="Cyberbullying">cyberbullying</a> and <a href="/wiki/Child_grooming" title="Child grooming">approaches by sexual predators</a>, who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable <a href="/wiki/Content-control_software" title="Content-control software">Internet filtering</a>, and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.</p>
<p>The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining <a href="/wiki/Social_experiment" title="Social experiment">social experiments</a> such as <a href="/wiki/MUD" title="MUD">MUDs</a> and <a href="/wiki/MOO" title="MOO">MOOs</a> being conducted on university servers, and humor-related <a href="/wiki/Usenet" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> groups receiving much traffic. Today, many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_forums" title="Internet forums">Internet forums</a> have sections devoted to games and funny videos. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The <a href="/wiki/Internet_pornography" title="Internet pornography">Internet pornography</a> and <a href="/wiki/Online_gambling" title="Online gambling">online gambling</a> industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general, this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.</p>
<p>Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multiplayer_gaming" title="Multiplayer gaming">multiplayer gaming</a>. This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MMORPG" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> to <a href="/wiki/First-person_shooter" title="First-person shooter">first-person shooters</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_video_game" title="Role-playing video game">role-playing video games</a> to <a href="/wiki/Online_gambling" title="Online gambling">online gambling</a>. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as <a href="/wiki/GameSpy_Arcade" title="GameSpy Arcade">GameSpy</a> and <a href="/wiki/MPlayer.com" title="MPlayer.com">MPlayer</a>. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.</p>
<p>Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness. Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the "<a href="/wiki/I_am_lonely_will_anyone_speak_to_me" title="I am lonely will anyone speak to me">I am lonely will anyone speak to me</a>" thread.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cybersectarianism" title="Cybersectarianism">Cybersectarianism</a> is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards." In particular, the British government has raised concerns about the prospect of young British Muslims being indoctrinated into Islamic extremism by material on the Internet, being persuaded to join <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Terrorist" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> groups such as the so-called "<a href="/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant" title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">Islamic State</a>", and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to Britain after fighting in Syria or Iraq.</p>

<p>While much has been written of the economic advantages of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_commerce" title="Electronic commerce">Internet-enabled commerce</a>, there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">economic inequality</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Digital_divide" title="Digital divide">digital divide</a>.

<p>The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a> in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to <a href="/wiki/Internet_activism" title="Internet activism">Internet activism</a>, most notably practiced by rebels in the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Spring" title="Arab Spring">Arab Spring</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> suggested that <a href="/wiki/Social_media" title="Social media">social media</a> websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.</p>
<p>The potential of the Internet as a civic tool of communicative power was explored by Simon R. B. Berdal in his 2004 thesis:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>As the globally evolving Internet provides ever new access points to virtual discourse forums, it also promotes new civic relations and associations within which communicative power may flow and accumulate. Thus, traditionally … national-embedded peripheries get entangled into greater, international peripheries, with stronger combined powers... The Internet, as a consequence, changes the topology of the "centre-periphery" model, by stimulating conventional peripheries to interlink into "super-periphery" structures, which enclose and "besiege" several centres at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Berdal, therefore, extends the <a href="/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas" title="Jürgen Habermas">Habermasian</a> notion of the <i><a href="/wiki/Public_sphere" title="Public sphere">public sphere</a></i> to the Internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that interwoven Internet technologies provide. To limit the growing civic potential of the Internet, Berdal also notes how "self-protective measures" are put in place by those threatened by it:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>If we consider China’s attempts to filter "unsuitable material" from the Internet, most of us would agree that this resembles a self-protective measure by the system against the growing civic potentials of the Internet. Nevertheless, both types represent limitations to "peripheral capacities". Thus, the Chinese government tries to prevent communicative power to build up and unleash (as the <a href="/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989">1989 Tiananmen Square uprising</a> suggests, the government may find it wise to install "upstream measures"). Even though limited, the Internet is proving to be an empowering tool also to the Chinese periphery: Analysts believe that Internet petitions have influenced policy implementation in favour of the public’s online-articulated will …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidents of politically motivated <a href="/wiki/Internet_censorship" title="Internet censorship">Internet censorship</a> have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philanthropy">Philanthropy</span></h3>
<p>The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for <a href="/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes" title="Social peer-to-peer processes">peer-to-peer</a> charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites, such as <a href="/wiki/DonorsChoose" title="DonorsChoose">DonorsChoose</a> and <a href="/wiki/GlobalGiving" title="GlobalGiving">GlobalGiving</a>, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer_lending" title="Peer-to-peer lending">peer-to-peer lending</a> for charitable purposes. <a href="/wiki/Kiva_(organization)" title="Kiva (organization)">Kiva</a> pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary <a href="/wiki/Microfinance" title="Microfinance">microfinance</a> organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.</p>
<p>However, the recent spread of low-cost Internet access in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> has made genuine international person-to-person philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit <a href="/wiki/Zidisha" title="Zidisha">Zidisha</a> tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of <a href="/wiki/Data_mining" title="Data mining">data</a> and <a href="/wiki/Traffic_analysis" title="Traffic analysis">traffic</a> on the Internet. In the United States for example, under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communications_Assistance_For_Law_Enforcement_Act" title="Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act">Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act</a>, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packet_capture" title="Packet capture">Packet capture</a> is the monitoring of data traffic on a <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">computer network</a>.

Under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communications_Assistance_For_Law_Enforcement_Act" title="Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act">Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act</a> all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Broadband_Internet" title="Broadband Internet">broadband Internet</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_protocol" title="Voice over Internet protocol">voice over Internet protocol</a> (VoIP) traffic.</p>
<p>The large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access of certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties. Agencies, such as the <a href="/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office" title="Information Awareness Office">Information Awareness Office</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NSA" title="NSA">NSA</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GCHQ" title="GCHQ">GCHQ</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data. Similar systems are operated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Intelligence_and_National_Security_of_Iran" title="Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran">Iranian secret police</a> to identify and suppress dissidents. The required hardware and software was allegedly installed by German <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Siemens_AG" title="Siemens AG">Siemens AG</a> and Finnish <a href="/wiki/Nokia" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>.</p>

<p>In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret. Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as <a href="/wiki/Child_pornography" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a>, via the Internet, but do not mandate filter software. Many free or commercially available software programs, called <a href="/wiki/Content-control_software" title="Content-control software">content-control software</a> are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Performance">Performance</span></h2>

<p>As the Internet is a heterogeneous network, the physical characteristics, including for example the <a href="/wiki/Bit_rate" title="Bit rate">data transfer rates</a> of connections, vary widely. It exhibits <a href="/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergent phenomena</a> that depend on its large-scale organization.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Outages">Outages</span></h3>
<p>An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signalling interruptions. Disruptions of <a href="/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable" title="Submarine communications cable">submarine communications cables</a> may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the <a href="/wiki/2008_submarine_cable_disruption" title="2008 submarine cable disruption">2008 submarine cable disruption</a>. Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links. Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia. Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of <a href="/wiki/Internet_censorship" title="Internet censorship">Internet censorship</a>, as in the blockage of the <a href="/wiki/Internet_in_Egypt" title="Internet in Egypt">Internet in Egypt</a>, whereby approximately 93% of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Egyptian_Revolution_of_2011" title="Egyptian Revolution of 2011">anti-government protests</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_use">Energy use</span></h3>
<p>In 2011, researchers estimated the energy used by the Internet to be between 170 and 307 GW, less than two percent of the energy used by humanity. This estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, Wi-Fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting Internet traffic.</p>
