The government was established in 1999 as the <b>Scottish Executive</b> under section 44(1) of the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998" title="Scotland Act 1998">Scotland Act 1998</a>, which created a devolved administration for <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in line with the result of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1997" title="Scottish devolution referendum, 1997">1997 referendum on Scottish devolution</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Responsibilities">Responsibilities</span></h2>
<p>The Scottish Government is responsible for devolved matters, and those not explicitly reserved to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Parliament" title="British Parliament">British Parliament</a> in Westminster, by Schedule 5 to the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998" title="Scotland Act 1998">Scotland Act 1998</a>.</p>
<p>Devolved matters that were decided on by the Scotland Act 1998 included <a href="/wiki/NHS_Scotland" title="NHS Scotland">healthcare provision</a>, <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Scotland" title="Education in Scotland">education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scots_law" title="Scots law">justice</a>, policing, rural affairs, economic development and <a href="/wiki/Transport_in_Scotland" title="Transport in Scotland">transport</a>. The Scottish Government also has administrative responsibility for some matters where it does not have legislative power. An example is Sections 36 &amp; 37 of the Electricity Act 1989 which allow the Scottish Government to authorise power transmission lines and grant power generation consents.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_Independence_Referendum,_2014" title="Scottish Independence Referendum, 2014">Scottish independence Referendum</a> in 2014, the Smith Commission was established to decide upon what matters should further be devolved given the increased hunger of the Scottish people for home rule. Some matters that were decided upon for devolution were some elements of Social Security, policing of transport, the Crown Estate in Scotland, road signage and speed limits and further elements of taxation.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government's budget is decided upon by the block grant that is formulated using the Barnett Formula with the ability to also increase or decrease income tax rates. In the financial year of 2016-17, the government's annual budget was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pound_Sterling" title="Pound Sterling">£</a>37.2 billion.</p>
<p>The government is led by the <a href="/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland" title="First Minister of Scotland">First Minister</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> nominates one of its members to be appointed as first minister by <a href="/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Monarchy of the United Kingdom">the monarch</a>. He or she is assisted by various cabinet secretaries with individual <a href="/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)" title="Ministry (government department)">portfolios</a>, who are appointed by him/her with the approval of parliament. Ministers are similarly appointed to assist cabinet secretaries in their work. The Scottish law officers, the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Advocate" title="Lord Advocate">Lord Advocate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solicitor_General_for_Scotland" title="Solicitor General for Scotland">Solicitor General</a>, can be appointed from outside the parliament's membership, but are subject to its approval. They are appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the first minister. The first minister, the cabinet secretaries and the Scottish law officers are the members of the Scottish Government. They are collectively known as the "Scottish Ministers".</p>
<p>The members of the government have substantial influence over <a href="/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999" title="List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999">legislation</a> in Scotland, putting forward the majority of bills that are successful in becoming Acts of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p>Scottish Government also includes a civil service that supports the Scottish ministers. According to 2012 reports, there are 16,000 civil servants working in core Scottish Government directorates and agencies.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Change_of_name">Change of name</span></h2>

<p>The original Scotland Act 1998 gave the name "Scottish Executive" as the legal term for the devolved government. In January 2001, the then First Minister <a href="/wiki/Henry_McLeish" title="Henry McLeish">Henry McLeish</a> suggested changing the official name from "Scottish Executive" to "Scottish Government". The reaction from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_government" title="British government">British government</a> and from some <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> members and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_Labour" title="Scottish Labour">Scottish Labour</a> MPs was allegedly hostile. This reaction was in contrast to a 2001 public survey by then-Labour chief whip <a href="/wiki/Tom_McCabe" title="Tom McCabe">Tom McCabe</a>, which showed that only 29% of the Scottish public wanted the title Scottish Executive to remain.</p>
<p>Scottish politicians, including the Labour first minister, had often referred to the executive as the "government" and this trend increased following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election_2007" title="Scottish Parliament general election 2007">2007 election</a>, when the SNP took office and Labour were in opposition for the first time. On 2 September 2007, the SNP minority government announced that the Scottish Executive was to be re-branded as the "Scottish Government".</p>
<p>The renaming was decided unilaterally by the minority government; as a consequence, the SNP was criticised by the three <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unionism_(Scotland)" title="Unionism (Scotland)">Unionist</a> opposition parties for acting without allowing for parliamentary scrutiny, debate or approval of their plan. However, the term "Scottish Government" has since then become common currency among all of the political parties in Scotland and the rest of the UK. The official Gaelic title, <i>Riaghaltas na h-Alba</i>, has always meant "Government of Scotland".</p>
<p>"Scottish Executive" remained the legal name under section 44(1) of the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998" title="Scotland Act 1998">Scotland Act 1998</a> until 2 July 2012. Neither the Scottish Executive nor the Scottish Parliament were able to change the legal name, as this required the British parliament to amend the Scotland Act. Section 12(1) of the <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Act_2012" title="Scotland Act 2012">Scotland Act 2012</a>, which came into effect on 3 July 2012, formally changed the name of the Scottish Executive to the "Scottish Government".</p>
<p>At the same time that the Scottish Government began to use its new name, a new emblem was adopted. The earlier version featured the old name and a version of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom#Scotland" title="Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom">Royal Arms for Scotland</a>, but without the <a href="/wiki/Motto" title="Motto">motto</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Helmet" title="Helmet">helm</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mantling" title="Mantling">mantling</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)" title="Crest (heraldry)">crest</a>, the war-cry above the crest, or the flags of <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Scotland" title="Flag of Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_England" title="Flag of England">England</a> carried by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supporters" title="Supporters">supporters</a>. In the rendering used, both supporters appeared to be crowned with the <a href="/wiki/Crown_of_Scotland" title="Crown of Scotland">Crown of Scotland</a>, whereas in the Royal Arms, the Scottish <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorn</a> is usually shown crowned with the Scottish Crown, and the English lion with <a href="/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown" title="St Edward's Crown">St Edward's Crown</a>.</p>
<p>In the September 2007 rebranding, this depiction of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_Scotland" title="Royal coat of arms of Scotland">Royal Arms</a> was replaced by one of the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Scotland" title="Flag of Scotland">Flag of Scotland</a>. However, the Royal Arms are still used by the Government for some official documents, such as directions issued in exercise of powers provided by legislation.</p>
<p>In 2016, a refreshed version of the Scottish Government logo was launched and used on all government websites and letters of correspondence.</p>
