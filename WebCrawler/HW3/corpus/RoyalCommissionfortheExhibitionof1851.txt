<p><b>Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851</b> is an institution founded in 1850 to administer the international exhibition of 1851, officially called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Exhibition" title="Great Exhibition">Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations</a>. The Great Exhibition was held in <a href="/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace" title="The Crystal Palace">The Crystal Palace</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, the enormous building was designed by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Paxton" title="Joseph Paxton">Joseph Paxton</a> for the Exhibition and construction was supervised by <a href="/wiki/William_Cubitt" title="William Cubitt">William Cubitt</a> using a <a href="/wiki/Cast_iron" title="Cast iron">cast iron</a> space frame for the glass panes, with wooden beams for flooring.</p>

The current president is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HRH_The_Princess_Royal" title="HRH The Princess Royal">HRH The Princess Royal</a>.</p>
<p>The exhibition was a great popular and financial success, and made a huge surplus of £186,000 (approximately £22m in today's money). An unusual decision was made to maintain the Royal Commission as a permanent administrative body to use the profits for charitable purposes. Its revised Charter charged the Commission with "increasing the means of industrial education and extending the influence of science and art upon productive industry".</p>
