<p>A <b>phase-change material</b> (<b>PCM</b>) is a substance with a high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_of_fusion" title="Heat of fusion">heat of fusion</a> which, melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa; thus, PCMs are classified as <a href="/wiki/Latent_heat" title="Latent heat">latent heat</a> storage (LHS) units.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics_and_classification">Characteristics and classification</span></h2>
<p>Latent heat storage can be achieved through liquid–&gt;solid, solid–&gt;liquid, solid–&gt;gas and liquid–&gt;gas phase changes. However, only solid–&gt;liquid and liquid–&gt;solid phase changes are practical for PCMs. Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions, liquid-&gt;gas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase. Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation.</p>
<p>Initially, solid–liquid PCMs behave like <a href="/wiki/Sensible_heat" title="Sensible heat">sensible heat</a> storage (SHS) materials; their temperature rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase (their melting temperature) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat. A large number of PCMs are available in any required temperature range from −5 up to 190 °C. Within the human comfort range between 20–30 °C, some PCMs are very effective. They store 5 to 14 times more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water, masonry or rock.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hygroscopic_materials">Hygroscopic materials</span></h3>
<p>Many natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Condensation (gas to liquid) ΔH&lt;0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat.</li>
<li>Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH&gt;0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2 °C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation, earth/clay render finishes,.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technology.2C_development_and_encapsulation">Technology, development and encapsulation</span></h2>
<p>The most commonly used PCMs are salt <a href="/wiki/Hydrate" title="Hydrate">hydrates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">esters</a>, and various <a href="/wiki/Alkane" title="Alkane">paraffins</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Octadecane" title="Octadecane">octadecane</a>). Recently also <a href="/wiki/Ionic_liquid" title="Ionic liquid">ionic liquids</a> were investigated as novel PCMs.</p>
<p>As most of the organic solutions are water-free, they can be exposed to air, but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake. Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications.</p>
<p>They have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_storage" title="Thermal storage">thermal storage</a> applications. They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation for rail and road applications and their physical properties are, therefore, well known.</p>
<p>Unlike the ice storage system, however, the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water <a href="/wiki/Chiller" title="Chiller">chiller</a> both for a new or alternatively retrofit application. The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a <a href="/wiki/Cooling_tower" title="Cooling tower">cooling tower</a> or dry cooler for charging the TES system.</p>
<p>The temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications. The scope of this thermal energy application is wide ranging of solar heating, hot water, heating rejection, i.e. cooling tower and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications.</p>
<p>Since PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling, encapsulation naturally become the obvious storage choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation of PCMs
<ul>
<li>Macro-encapsulation: Early development of macro-encapsulation with large volume containment failed due to the poor <a href="/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" title="Thermal conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> of most PCMs. PCMs tend to solidify at the edges of the containers preventing effective heat transfer.</li>
<li>Micro-encapsulation: <a href="/wiki/Micro-encapsulation" title="Micro-encapsulation">Micro-encapsulation</a> on the other hand showed no such problem. It allows the PCMs to be incorporated into construction materials, such as <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a>, easily and economically. Micro-encapsulated PCMs also provide a portable heat storage system. By coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating, the particles can be <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)" title="Suspension (chemistry)">suspended</a> within a continuous phase such as water. This system can be considered a <b>phase change <a href="/wiki/Slurry" title="Slurry">slurry</a></b> (<b>PCS</b>).</li>
<li>Molecular-encapsulation is another technology, developed by Dupont de Nemours that allows a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound. It allows storage capacity up to 515 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilojoule" title="Kilojoule">kJ</a>/<a href="/wiki/Square_metre" title="Square metre">m</a> for a 5 <a href="/wiki/Millimetre" title="Millimetre">mm</a> board (103 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megajoule" title="Megajoule">MJ</a>/<a href="/wiki/Cubic_metre" title="Cubic metre">m</a>). Molecular-encapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As phase change materials perform best in small containers, therefore they are usually divided in cells. The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hygroscopic" title="Hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>). Packaging must also resist leakage and <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a>. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include <a href="/wiki/Stainless_steel" title="Stainless steel">stainless steel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polypropylene" title="Polypropylene">polypropylene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polyolefin" title="Polyolefin">polyolefin</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermal_composites">Thermal composites</span></h2>
<p>Thermal-composites is a term given to combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and other (usually solid) structures. A simple example is a copper-mesh immersed in a paraffin-wax. The copper-mesh within parraffin-wax can be considered a composite material, dubbed a thermal-composite. Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity is a common property which is targeted for maximisation by creating thermal composites. In this case the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid (such as the copper-mesh) into the relatively low conducting PCM thus increasing overall or bulk (thermal) conductivity. If the PCM is required to flow, the solid must be porous, such as a mesh.</p>
<p>Solid composites such as fibre-glass or kevlar-pre-preg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fibre (the kevlar or the glass) and a matrix (the glue which solidifies to hold fibres and provide compressive strength). A thermal composite is not so clearly defined, but could similarly refer to a matrix (solid) and the PCM which is of course usually liquid and/or solid depending on conditions. They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fire_and_safety_issues">Fire and safety issues</span></h2>
<p>Some phase change materials are suspended in water, and are relatively nontoxic. Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials, or are toxic. As such, PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully, in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices. Because of the increased fire risk, flamespread, smoke, potential for explosion when held in containers, and liability, it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings. Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics.</p>
