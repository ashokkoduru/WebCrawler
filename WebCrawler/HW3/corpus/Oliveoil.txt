<p><b>Olive oil</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a> obtained from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Olive_(fruit)" title="Olive (fruit)">olive</a> (the fruit of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Olea_europaea" title="Olea europaea">Olea europaea</a></i>; family <a href="/wiki/Oleaceae" title="Oleaceae">Oleaceae</a>), a traditional tree <a href="/wiki/Crop" title="Crop">crop</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin" title="Mediterranean Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a>, whether for frying or as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salad_dressing" title="Salad dressing">salad dressing</a>. It is also used in <a href="/wiki/Cosmetics" title="Cosmetics">cosmetics</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceuticals" title="Pharmaceuticals">pharmaceuticals</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Soap" title="Soap">soaps</a>, and as a fuel for traditional <a href="/wiki/Oil_lamp" title="Oil lamp">oil lamps</a>, and finds uses in some religions. It is associated with the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_diet" title="Mediterranean diet">Mediterranean diet</a> popularized since the 1950s in North America for its possible health benefits. The olive is one of the three core food plants in <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine" title="Mediterranean cuisine">Mediterranean cuisine</a>, the other two being <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Grape" title="Grape">grape</a>.</p>
<p>Olive trees have been grown around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC. Spain is by far the largest producer of olive oil, followed by Italy and Greece. Per capita consumption is however highest in Greece, followed by Spain, Italy, and Morocco. Consumption in North America and northern Europe is far less, but rising steadily.</p>
<p>The composition of olive oil varies with the <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivar</a>, altitude, time of harvest and extraction process. It consists mainly of <a href="/wiki/Oleic_acid" title="Oleic acid">oleic acid</a> (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including <a href="/wiki/Linoleic_acid" title="Linoleic acid">linoleic acid</a> (up to 21%) and <a href="/wiki/Palmitic_acid" title="Palmitic acid">palmitic acid</a> (up to 20%). Extra-virgin olive oil is required to have no more than 0.8% <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">free acidity</a> and is considered to have the best flavor; it forms as much as 80% of total production in Greece and 65% in Italy, but far less in other countries.</p>

<p>The olive tree is native to the Mediterranean basin; wild olives were collected by <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> peoples as early as the 8th millennium BC. The wild olive tree originated in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a> or in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. It is not clear when and where olive trees were first domesticated: in Asia Minor, in the <a href="/wiki/Levant" title="Levant">Levant</a>, or somewhere in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesopotamian" title="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> <a href="/wiki/Fertile_Crescent" title="Fertile Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archaeological_evidence" title="Archaeological evidence">Archeological evidence</a> shows that olives were turned into olive oil by 6000 BC and 4500 BC in present-day Israel. Until 1500 BC, eastern coastal areas of the Mediterranean were most heavily cultivated. Evidence also suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2,500 BC. The earliest surviving olive oil <a href="/wiki/Amphora" title="Amphora">amphorae</a> date to 3500 BC (Early Minoan times), though the production of olive oil is assumed to have started before 4000 BC. Olive trees were certainly cultivated by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Late_Minoan" title="Late Minoan">Late Minoan</a> period (1500 BC) in Crete, and perhaps as early as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Early_Minoan" title="Early Minoan">Early Minoan</a>. The cultivation of olive trees in Crete became particularly intense in the post-palatial period and played an important role in the island's economy, as it did across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Recent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetic_studies" title="Genetic studies">genetic studies</a> suggest that species used by modern cultivators descend from multiple wild populations, but a detailed history of domestication is not yet forthcoming.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History_and_trade">History and trade</span></h3>

<p>Olive trees and oil production in the Eastern Mediterranean can be traced to archives of the ancient city-state <a href="/wiki/Ebla" title="Ebla">Ebla</a> (2600–2240 BC), which were located on the outskirts of the <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syrian</a> city <a href="/wiki/Aleppo" title="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. Here some dozen documents dated 2400 BC describe lands of the king and the queen. These belonged to a library of clay tablets perfectly preserved by having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace. A later source is the frequent mentions of oil in the <a href="/wiki/Tanakh" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>. Dynastic <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptians</a> before 2000 BC imported olive oil from Crete, Syria and <a href="/wiki/Canaan" title="Canaan">Canaan</a> and oil was an important item of commerce and wealth. Remains of olive oil have been found in jugs over 4,000 years old in a tomb on the island of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Naxos_Island" title="Naxos Island">Naxos</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sinuhe" title="Sinuhe">Sinuhe</a>, the Egyptian exile who lived in northern Canaan about 1960 BC, wrote of abundant olive trees.</p>
<p>Besides food, olive oil has been used for religious <a href="/wiki/Ritual" title="Ritual">rituals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicines</a>, as a <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a> in <a href="/wiki/Oil_lamp" title="Oil lamp">oil lamps</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Making_soap" title="Making soap">soap-making</a>, and skin care application. The Minoans used olive oil in religious ceremonies. The oil became a principal product of the <a href="/wiki/Minoan_civilization" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan civilization</a>, where it is thought to have represented wealth. Olive oil, a multi-purpose product of <a href="/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" title="Mycenaean Greece">Mycenaean Greece</a> (c. 1600-1100 BC) at that time, was a chief export. Olive tree growing reached <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iberian_peninsula" title="Iberian peninsula">Iberia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Etruscan_civilization" title="Etruscan civilization">Etruscan</a> cities well before the 8th century BC through trade with the <a href="/wiki/Phoenicia" title="Phoenicia">Phoenicians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carthage" title="Carthage">Carthage</a>, then was spread into Southern <a href="/wiki/Gaul" title="Gaul">Gaul</a> by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Celt" title="Celt">Celtic</a> tribes during the 7th century BC.</p>
<p>The first recorded oil extraction is known from the Hebrew Bible and took place during <a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt, during the 13th century BC. During this time, the oil was derived through hand-squeezing the berries and stored in special containers under guard of the priests. A commercial mill for non-sacramental use of oil was in use in the tribal Confederation and later in 1000 BC, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertile_crescent" title="Fertile crescent">fertile crescent</a>, an area consisting of present-day Palestine, Lebanon, and Israel. Over 100 olive presses have been found in Tel Miqne (Ekron), where the Biblical <a href="/wiki/Philistines" title="Philistines">Philistines</a> also produced oil. These presses are estimated to have had output of between 1,000 and 3,000 tons of olive oil per season.</p>
<p>Many ancient presses still exist in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and some dating to the Roman period are still in use today.</p>

<p>Olive oil was common in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">ancient Greek</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cuisine_of_ancient_Rome" title="Cuisine of ancient Rome">Roman cuisine</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bibliotheca_(Pseudo-Apollodorus)" title="Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)">Apollodorus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plutarch" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pausanias_(geographer)" title="Pausanias (geographer)">Pausanias</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ovid" title="Ovid">Ovid</a> and other sources, the city of <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> obtained its name because Athenians considered olive oil essential, preferring the offering of the goddess <a href="/wiki/Athena" title="Athena">Athena</a> (an olive tree) over the offering of <a href="/wiki/Poseidon" title="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> (a spring of <a href="/wiki/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a> water gushing out of a cliff). The <a href="/wiki/Sparta" title="Sparta">Spartans</a> and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the <a href="/wiki/Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" title="Gymnasium (ancient Greece)">gymnasia</a>. From its beginnings early in the 7th century BC, the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of the Hellenic city states, together with athletes training in the nude, and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense. Olive trees were planted throughout the entire Mediterranean basin during evolution of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_republic" title="Roman republic">Roman republic</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_empire" title="Roman empire">empire</a>. According to the historian <a href="/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, Italy had "excellent olive oil at reasonable prices" by the 1st century AD, "the best in the Mediterranean", he maintained.</p>

<p>The importance and antiquity of olive oil can be seen in the fact that the English word <i>oil</i> derives from c. 1175, <i>olive oil</i>, from Anglo-Fr. and O.N.Fr. <i>olie</i>, from O.Fr. <i>oile</i> (12c., Mod.Fr. <i>huile</i>), from L. <i>oleum</i> "oil, olive oil" (cf. It. <i>olio</i>), from Gk. <i>elaion</i> "olive tree", which may have been borrowed through trade networks from the Semitic Phoenician use of <i>el'yon</i> meaning "superior", probably in recognized comparison to other vegetable or animal <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fats</a> available at the time. <a href="/wiki/Robin_Lane_Fox" title="Robin Lane Fox">Robin Lane Fox</a> suggests that the Latin borrowing of Greek <i>elaion</i> for oil (Latin <i>oleum</i>) is itself a marker for improved Greek varieties of oil-producing olive, already present in Italy as Latin was forming, brought by <a href="/wiki/Euboea" title="Euboea">Euboean</a> traders, whose presence in Latium is signaled by remains of their characteristic pottery, from the mid-8th century.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/List_of_olive_cultivars" title="List of olive cultivars">List of olive cultivars</a></div>
<p>There are many different olive varieties or <a href="/wiki/List_of_olive_cultivars" title="List of olive cultivars">olives</a>, each with a particular flavor, texture, and shelf life that make them more or less suitable for different applications such as direct human consumption on bread or in salads, indirect consumption in domestic cooking or catering, or industrial uses such as animal feed or engineering applications.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production_and_consumption">Production and consumption</span></h2>


<p>In 2013, world production of virgin olive oil was 2.8 million <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tonnes" title="Tonnes">tonnes</a> (table), a 20% decrease from the 2012 world production of 3.5 million tonnes. Spain produced 1.1 million tonnes or 39% of world production in 2013. 75% of Spain's production derives from the region of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Andaluc%C3%ADa" title="Andalucía">Andalucía</a>, particularly within <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Ja%C3%A9n_(Spain)" title="Province of Jaén (Spain)">Jaén province</a> which produces 70% of olive oil in Spain.

<p>Although Italy is a net importer of olive oil, it produced 442,000 tonnes in 2013 or 16% of the world's production (table). Major Italian producers are known as "Città dell'Olio", "oil cities"; including <a href="/wiki/Lucca" title="Lucca">Lucca</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siena" title="Siena">Siena</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Tuscany" title="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>. The largest production, however, is harvested in <a href="/wiki/Apulia" title="Apulia">Apulia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calabria" title="Calabria">Calabria</a>. Greece accounted for 11% of world production in 2013.</p>
<p>Australia now produces a substantial amount of olive oil. Many Australian producers only make premium oils, while a number of corporate growers operate groves of a million trees or more and produce oils for the general market. Australian olive oil is exported to Asia, Europe and the United States.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulation">Regulation</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_regulation_and_adulteration" title="Olive oil regulation and adulteration">Olive oil regulation and adulteration</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Olive_Council" title="International Olive Council">International Olive Council</a> (IOC) is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce olives or products derived from olives, such as olive oil. The IOC officially governs 95% of international production and holds great influence over the rest. The EU regulates the use of different <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protected_designation_of_origin" title="Protected designation of origin">protected designation of origin</a> labels for olive oils.</p>
<p>The United States is not a member of the IOC and is not subject to its authority, but on October 25, 2010, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the IOC, with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the U.S. Additionally, U.S. Customs regulations on "country of origin" state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer. Yet most major U.S. brands continue to put "imported from Italy" on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print. "In fact, olive oil labeled 'Italian' often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece." This makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Commercial_grades">Commercial grades</span></h3>


<p>All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing. This paste is then <a href="/wiki/Malaxation" title="Malaxation">malaxed</a> (slowly churned or mixed) to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press (traditional method) or <a href="/wiki/Centrifuge" title="Centrifuge">centrifugation</a> (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called <a href="/wiki/Olive_mill_pomace" title="Olive mill pomace">pomace</a>, still contains a small quantity of oil.</p>
<p>To classify its <a href="/wiki/Organoleptic" title="Organoleptic">organoleptic</a> qualities, olive oil is judged by a panel of trained tasters in a <a href="/wiki/Blind_taste_test" title="Blind taste test">blind taste test</a>.</p>
<p>One parameter used to characterise an oil is its <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">acidity</a>. In this context, "acidity" is not <a href="/wiki/Acid#Acid_strength" title="Acid">chemical acidity</a> in the sense of <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a>, but the percent (measured by weight) of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_fatty_acids" title="Free fatty acids">free</a> <a href="/wiki/Oleic_acid" title="Oleic acid">oleic acid</a>. Measured by <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(chemistry)" title="Quantitative analysis (chemistry)">quantitative analysis</a>, acidity is a measure of the <a href="/wiki/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of the oil's triglycerides: as the oil degrades, more fatty acids are freed from the <a href="/wiki/Glyceride" title="Glyceride">glycerides</a>, increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing <a href="/wiki/Rancidification#Hydrolytic_rancidity" title="Rancidification">hydrolytic rancidity</a>. Another measure of the oil's chemical degradation is the <a href="/wiki/Organic_peroxide" title="Organic peroxide">peroxide value</a>, which measures the degree to which the oil is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidized</a> damaged by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_radicals" title="Free radicals">free radicals</a>, leading to <i>oxidative</i> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rancidity" title="Rancidity">rancidity</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phenolic_acids" title="Phenolic acids">Phenolic acids</a> present in olive oil also add acidic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sensory_perception" title="Sensory perception">sensory</a> properties to aroma and flavor.</p>
<p>The grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Virgin</i> means the oil was produced by the use of mechanical means only, with no chemical treatment. The term <i>virgin oil</i> with reference to production method includes all grades of virgin olive oil, including <i>Extra Virgin</i>, <i>Virgin</i>, <i>Ordinary Virgin</i> and <i>Lampante Virgin</i> olive oil products, depending on quality (see below).</li>
<li><i>Lampante virgin oil</i> is olive oil extracted by virgin (mechanical) methods but not suitable for human consumption without further refining; <i>lampante</i> is Italian for "glaring", referring to the earlier use of such oil for burning in lamps. Lampante virgin oil can be used for industrial purposes, or refined (see below) to make it edible.</li>
<li><i>Refined Olive Oil</i> is the olive oil obtained from any grade of virgin olive oil by refining methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. The refining process removes colour, odour and flavour from the olive oil, and leaves behind a very pure form of olive oil that is tasteless, colourless and odourless and extremely low in free fatty acids. Olive oils sold as the grades <i>extra-virgin olive oil</i> and <i>virgin olive oil</i> therefore cannot contain any refined oil.</li>
<li><i>Crude Olive Pomace Oil</i> is the oil obtained by treating olive pomace (the leftover paste after the pressing of olives for virgin olive oils) with solvents or other physical treatments, to the exclusion of oils obtained by re-esterification processes and of any mixture with oils of other kinds. It is then further refined into <i>Refined Olive Pomace Oil</i> and once re-blended with virgin olive oils for taste, is then known as <i>Olive Pomace Oil</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="International_Olive_Council">International Olive Council</span></h4>
<p>In countries that adhere to the standards of the International Olive Council (IOC), as well as in Australia, and under the voluntary USDA labeling standards in the United States:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Extra-virgin olive oil</b> Comes from virgin oil production only, and is of higher quality: among other things, it contains no more than 0.8% <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">free acidity</a>, and is judged to have a superior taste, having some fruitiness and no defined sensory defects. Extra-virgin olive oil accounts for less than 10% of oil in many producing countries; the percentage is far higher in the Mediterranean countries (Greece: 80%, Italy: 65%, Spain 50%).</li>
<li><b>Virgin olive oil</b> Comes from virgin oil production only, but is of slightly lower quality, with <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">free acidity</a> of up to 1.5%, and is judged to have a good taste, but may include some sensory defects.</li>
<li><b>Refined olive oil</b> is the olive oil obtained from virgin olive oils by refining methods that do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. It has a <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">free acidity</a>, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams (0.3%) and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard. This is obtained by refining virgin olive oils with a high acidity level or organoleptic defects that are eliminated after refining. Note that no solvents have been used to extract the oil, but it has been refined with the use of charcoal and other chemical and physical filters. Oils labeled as <i>Pure olive oil</i> or <i>Olive oil</i> are primarily refined olive oil, with a small addition of virgin-production to give taste.</li>
<li><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Olive_Pomace_Oil" title="Olive Pomace Oil">Olive pomace oil</a></b> is refined pomace olive oil often blended with some virgin oil. It is fit for consumption, but may not be described simply as <i>olive oil</i>. It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil, making it unfashionable among connoisseurs; however, it has the same fat composition as regular olive oil, giving it the same health benefits. It also has a high smoke point, and thus is widely used in restaurants as well as home cooking in some countries.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h4>
<p>As the United States is not a member, the IOC retail grades have no legal meaning there, but on October 25, 2010, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) established Standards for Grades of Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil, which closely parallel the IOC standards:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>U.S. Extra Virgin Olive Oil</b> for oil with excellent flavor and odor and <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">free fatty acid content</a> of not more than 0.8 g per 100 g (0.8%);</li>
<li><b>U.S. Virgin Olive Oil</b> for oil with reasonably good flavor and odor and <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_acidity" title="Olive oil acidity">free fatty acid content</a> of not more than 2 g per 100 g (2%);</li>
<li><b>U.S. Virgin Olive Oil Not Fit For Human Consumption Without Further Processing</b> is a virgin (mechanically-extracted) olive oil of poor flavor and odor, equivalent to the IOC's <i>lampante</i> oil;</li>
<li><b>U.S. Olive Oil</b> is a mixture of virgin and refined oils;</li>
<li><b>U.S. Refined Olive Oil</b> is an oil made from refined oils with some restrictions on the processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These grades are voluntary. Certification is available, for a fee, from the USDA.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Label_wording">Label wording</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Different names for olive oil indicate the degree of processing the oil has undergone as well as the quality of the oil. Extra-virgin olive oil is the highest grade available, followed by virgin olive oil. The word "virgin" indicates that the olives have been pressed to extract the oil; no heat or chemicals have been used during the extraction process, and the oil is pure and unrefined. Virgin olive oils contain the highest levels of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyphenols" title="Polyphenols">polyphenols</a>, antioxidants that have been linked with better health.</li>
<li><i>Olive Oil</i>, which is sometimes denoted as being "Made from refined and virgin olive oils" is a blend of refined olive oil with a virgin grade of olive oil. <i>Pure</i>, <i>Classic</i>, <i>Light</i> and <i>Extra-Light</i> are terms introduced by manufacturers in countries that are non-traditional consumers of olive oil for these products to indicate both their composition of being only 100% olive oil, and also the varying strength of taste to consumers. Contrary to a common consumer belief, they do not have fewer calories than Extra-virgin oil as implied by the names.</li>
<li><i>Cold pressed</i> or <i>Cold extraction</i> means "that the oil was not heated over a certain temperature (usually 27 °C (80 °F)) during processing, thus retaining more nutrients and undergoing less degradation". The difference between <i>Cold Extraction</i> and <i>Cold Pressed</i> is regulated in Europe, where the use of a centrifuge, the modern method of extraction for large quantities, must be labelled as <i>Cold Extracted</i>, while only a physically pressed olive oil may be labelled as <i>Cold Pressed</i>. In many parts of the world, such as Australia, producers using centrifugal extraction still label their products as <i>Cold Pressed</i>.</li>
<li><i>First cold pressed</i> means "that the fruit of the olive was crushed exactly one time-i.e., the <i>first press.</i> The <i>cold</i> refers to the temperature range of the fruit at the time it is crushed". In Calabria (Italy) the olives are collected in October. In regions like Tuscany or Liguria, the olives collected in November and ground often at night are too cold to be processed efficiently without heating. The paste is regularly heated above the environmental temperatures, which may be as low as 10–15 °C, to extract the oil efficiently with only physical means. Olives pressed in warm regions like Southern Italy or Northern Africa may be pressed at significantly higher temperatures although not heated. While it is important that the pressing temperatures be as low as possible (generally below 25 °C) there is no international reliable definition of "cold pressed".<br/>
Furthermore, there is no "second" press of virgin oil, so the term "first press" means only that the oil was produced in a press vs. other possible methods.</li>
<li><i><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protected_designation_of_origin" title="Protected designation of origin">PDO</a></b></i> and <i><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protected_designation_of_origin" title="Protected designation of origin">PGI</a></b></i> refers to olive oils with "exceptional properties and quality derived from their place of origin as well as from the way of their production".</li>
<li>The label may indicate that the oil was bottled or packed in a stated country. This does not necessarily mean that the oil was produced there. The origin of the oil may sometimes be marked elsewhere on the label; it may be a mixture of oils from more than one country.</li>
<li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted a claim on olive oil labels stating: "Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about two tablespoons (23 g) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adulteration">Adulteration</span></h3>
<p>There have been allegations, particularly in Italy and Spain, that regulation can be sometimes lax and corrupt. Major shippers are claimed to routinely adulterate olive oil so that only about 40% of olive oil sold as "extra virgin" in Italy actually meets the specification. In some cases, <a href="/wiki/Colza_oil" title="Colza oil">colza oil</a> (extracted from <a href="/wiki/Rapeseed" title="Rapeseed">rapeseed</a>) with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil. This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil, under which every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced, as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used, for blended oils. In February 2008, however, EU officials took issue with the new law, stating that under EU rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory. Under EU rules, olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil.</p>
<p>Extra Virgin olive oil has strict requirements and is checked for "sensory defects" that include: rancid, fusty, musty, winey (vinegary) and muddy sediment. These defects can occur for different reasons. The most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw material (olives) infected or battered</li>
<li>Inadequate harvest, with contact between the olives and soil</li>
</ul>
<p>In March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted "Operation Golden Oil", arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a large-scale scheme to relabel oils from other Mediterranean nations as Italian. In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding <a href="/wiki/Chlorophyll" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> to <a href="/wiki/Sunflower_oil" title="Sunflower oil">sunflower</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soybean_oil" title="Soybean oil">soybean oil</a>, and selling it as extra virgin olive oil, both in Italy and abroad; 25,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2011, the prosecutor's office in Florence, Italy, working in conjunction with the forestry department, indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli, one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS (which recently changed its name to Deoleo). The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that "the case is based on an irregularity in the documents."</p>
<p>In February 2012, an international olive oil scam was alleged by Spanish police to have taken place, in which palm, avocado, sunflower and other cheaper oils were passed off as Italian olive oil. Police said the oils were blended in an industrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature. The oils were not toxic and posed no health risk, according to a statement by the Guardia Civil. Nineteen people were arrested following the year-long joint probe by the police and Spanish tax authorities, part of what they call Operation Lucerna.</p>
<p>Using tiny print to state the origin of blended oil is used as a legal loophole by manufacturers of adulterated and mixed olive oil.</p>
<p>Journalist Tom Mueller has investigated crime and adulteration in the olive oil business, publishing the article "Slippery Business" in <i>New Yorker</i> magazine, followed by the 2011 book <i><a href="/wiki/Extra_Virginity" title="Extra Virginity">Extra Virginity</a></i>. On 3 January 2016 <a href="/wiki/Bill_Whitaker_(journalist)" title="Bill Whitaker (journalist)">Bill Whitaker</a> presented a program on CBS News including interviews with Mueller and with Italian authorities. It was reported that in the previous month 5,000 tons of adulterated olive oil had been sold in Italy, and that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organised_crime" title="Organised crime">organised crime</a> was heavily involved—the term "Agrimafia" was used. The point was made by Mueller that the profit margin on adulterated olive oil was three times that on the illegal narcotic drug <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>. He said that over 50% of olive oil sold in Italy was adulterated, as was 75-80% of that sold in the US. Whitaker reported that 3 samples of "extra virgin olive oil" had been bought in a US supermarket and tested; two of the three samples did not meet the required standard, and one of them—with a top-selling US brand—was exceptionally poor.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Global_consumption">Global consumption</span></h2>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil_extraction" title="Olive oil extraction">Olive oil extraction</a></div>
<p>Olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means. Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid, so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened. The process is generally as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The olives are ground into paste using large millstones (traditional method) or steel drums (modern method).</li>
<li>If ground with mill stones, the olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may result in a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.</li>
<li>In modern steel drum mills the grinding process takes about 20 minutes. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops unite into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.<br/>
The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.</li>
<li>Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product. Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has <i>not</i> been filtered, suggesting a different taste. Fresh <a href="/wiki/Unfiltered_olive_oil" title="Unfiltered olive oil">unfiltered olive oil</a> usually has a slightly cloudy appearance, and is therefore sometimes called <i>cloudy olive oil</i>. This form of olive oil used to be popular only among olive oil small scale producers but is now becoming "trendy", in line with consumer's demand for products that are perceived to be less processed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The remaining paste (pomace) still contains a small quantity (about 5–10%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents. This is done in specialised chemical plants, not in the oil mills. The resulting oil is not "virgin" but "pomace oil". The term "first press", sometimes found on bottle labels, is today meaningless, as there is no "second" press; it comes from ancient times of stone presses, when virgin oil was the one produced by battering the olives.</p>
<p>The label term "cold-extraction" on extra virgin olive oils indicates that the olive grinding and stirring was done at a temperature of maximum 25 °C (77 °F), as treatment in higher temperatures risks decreasing the olive oils' quality (texture, taste and aroma).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constituents">Constituents</span></h2>

<p>Olive oil has a long history of being used as a home remedy for skincare. Egyptians used it alongside beeswax as a cleanser, moisturizer, and antibacterial agent since pharaonic times. In ancient Greece, the substance was used during massage, to prevent sports injuries, relieve muscle fatigue, and eliminate lactic acid buildup. In 2000, Japan was the top importer of olive oil in Asia (13,000 tons annually) because consumers there believe both the ingestion and topical application of olive oil to be good for skin and health.</p>
<p>There has been relatively little scientific work done on the effect of olive oil on acne and other skin conditions. However, one study noted that <a href="/wiki/Squalene" title="Squalene">squalene</a>, which is in olive oil, may contribute to relief of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seborrheic_dermatitis" title="Seborrheic dermatitis">seborrheic dermatitis</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Acne" title="Acne">acne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psoriasis" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a> or <a href="/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis" title="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</a>.</p>
<p>Olive oil is popular for use in massaging infants and toddlers, but scientific evidence of its efficacy is mixed. One analysis of olive oil versus <a href="/wiki/Mineral_oil" title="Mineral oil">mineral oil</a> found that, when used for infant massage, olive oil can be considered a safe alternative to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grapeseed" title="Grapeseed">grapeseed</a> and fractionated <a href="/wiki/Coconut_oil" title="Coconut oil">coconut oils</a>. This stands true particularly when it is mixed with a lighter oil like sunflower, which "would have the further effect of reducing the already low levels of free fatty acids present in olive oil". Another trial stated that olive oil lowered the risk of dermatitis for infants in all gestational stages when compared with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emollient" title="Emollient">emollient</a> cream. However, yet another study on adults found that topical treatment with olive oil "significantly damages the skin barrier" when compared to sunflower oil, and that it may make existing <a href="/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis" title="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</a> worse. The researchers concluded that due to the negative outcome in adults, they do not recommend the use of olive oil for the treatment of dry skin and infant massage.</p>

<p>Olive oil consumption is thought to affect <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cardiovascular_health" title="Cardiovascular health">cardiovascular health</a>. It has been suggested that long-term consumption of small quantities of the <a href="/wiki/Polyphenol" title="Polyphenol">polyphenol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oleocanthal" title="Oleocanthal">oleocanthal</a>, from olive oil may be responsible in part for the low incidence of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heart_disease" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a> associated with a <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_diet" title="Mediterranean diet">Mediterranean diet</a>. <a href="/wiki/Epidemiology" title="Epidemiology">Epidemiological studies</a> indicate that a higher proportion of <a href="/wiki/Monounsaturated_fat" title="Monounsaturated fat">monounsaturated fats</a> in the diet may be linked with a reduction in the risk of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coronary_heart_disease" title="Coronary heart disease">coronary heart disease</a>. There is preliminary evidence that regular consumption of olive oil may lower risk of all-cause mortality and several chronic diseases.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive scientific review by the <a href="/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority" title="European Food Safety Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> (EFSA) in 2011, health claims on olive oil were approved for protection by its <a href="/wiki/Polyphenol" title="Polyphenol">polyphenols</a> against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidation</a> of blood lipids, and for the contribution to the maintenance of normal blood <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LDL-cholesterol" title="LDL-cholesterol">LDL-cholesterol</a> levels by replacing saturated fats in the diet with <a href="/wiki/Oleic_acid" title="Oleic acid">oleic acid</a> (Commission Regulation (EU) 432/2012 of 16 May 2012). A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cause-and-effect" title="Cause-and-effect">cause-and-effect</a> relationship has not been adequately established for consumption of olive oil and maintaining normal (fasting) blood concentrations of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triglycerides" title="Triglycerides">triglycerides</a>, normal blood <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HDL-cholesterol" title="HDL-cholesterol">HDL-cholesterol</a> concentrations, and normal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blood_glucose" title="Blood glucose">blood glucose</a> concentrations.</p>
<p>A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that olive oil consumption may play a protective role against the development of any type of cancer, but could not clarify whether the beneficial effect is due to olive oil monounsaturated fatty acid content or its antioxidant components.</p>
<p>A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that an elevated consumption of olive oil is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke, while monounsaturated fatty acids of mixed animal and plant origin showed no significant effects.</p>
<p>In the United States, producers of olive oil may place the following restricted health claim on product labels:</p>

<p>Olive oil is the main <a href="/wiki/Cooking_oil" title="Cooking oil">cooking oil</a> in countries surrounding the Mediterranean, and it forms one of the three staple food plants of <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine" title="Mediterranean cuisine">Mediterranean cuisine</a>, the other two being <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> (as in <a href="/wiki/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Couscous" title="Couscous">couscous</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Grape" title="Grape">grape</a>, used as a dessert <a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a> and for <a href="/wiki/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>.</p>
<p>Extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salad_dressing" title="Salad dressing">salad dressing</a> and as an ingredient in salad dressings. It is also used with foods to be eaten cold. If uncompromised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It also can be used for <a href="/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing" title="Sautéing">sautéing</a>.</p>
<p>The higher the temperature to which the olive oil is heated, the higher the risk of compromising its taste. When extra virgin olive oil is heated above 210–216 °C (410–421 °F), depending on its free fatty acid content, the unrefined particles within the oil are burned. This leads to deteriorated taste. Also, the pronounced taste of extra virgin olive oil is not a taste most people like to associate with their deep fried foods. Refined olive oils are perfectly suited for <a href="/wiki/Deep_frying" title="Deep frying">deep frying</a> foods and should be replaced after several uses.</p>
<p>Choosing a cold-pressed olive oil can be similar to selecting a <a href="/wiki/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>. The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish.</p>
<p>An important issue often not realized in countries that do not produce olive oil is that the freshness makes a big difference. A very fresh oil, as available in an oil producing region, tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere. In time, oils deteriorate and become stale. One-year-old oil may be still pleasant to the taste, but it is less fragrant than fresh oil. After the first year, olive oil should be used for cooking, not for foods to be eaten cold, like salads.</p>
<p>The taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground (less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors – riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil).</p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religious_use">Religious use</span></h3>

<p>Olive oil also has religious symbolism for healing and strength and to consecration—setting a person or place apart for special work. This may be related to its ancient use as a medicinal agent and for cleansing athletes by slathering them in oil then scraping them.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Judaism">Judaism</span></h4>

Although candles can be used to light the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hanukkiah" title="Hanukkiah">hanukkiah</a>, oil containers are preferred, to imitate the original Menorah. Another use of oil in Jewish religion is for anointing the kings of the Kingdom of Israel, originating from King David. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tzidkiyahu" title="Tzidkiyahu">Tzidkiyahu</a> was the last anointed King of Israel.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Christians</a> still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners and in the cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled the rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Church, olive oil is a product not consumed during <a href="/wiki/Lent" title="Lent">lent</a> or <a href="/wiki/Penance" title="Penance">penance</a> while Orthodox <a href="/wiki/Monk" title="Monk">monks</a> use it sparingly in their diet.

<p>In Islam, <b>olive</b> oil is mentioned in the <a href="/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quranic</a> verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.
