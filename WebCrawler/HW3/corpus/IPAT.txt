<p><b>I = PAT</b> is the lettering of a formula put forward to describe the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_impacts_on_the_environment" title="Human impacts on the environment">impact of human activity on the environment</a>.</p>

<p>In words:</p>

<p>The equation was developed in the 1970s during the course of a debate between <a href="/wiki/Barry_Commoner" title="Barry Commoner">Barry Commoner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich" title="Paul R. Ehrlich">Paul R. Ehrlich</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Holdren" title="John Holdren">John Holdren</a>. Commoner argued that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_impact" title="Environmental impact">environmental impacts</a> in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, while Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a>.</p>
<p>The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment, but it has also been cited as one of the primary factors underlying many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by <a href="/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich" title="Paul R. Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Wald" title="George Wald">George Wald</a>, <a href="/wiki/Denis_Hayes" title="Denis Hayes">Denis Hayes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lester_R._Brown" title="Lester R. Brown">Lester Brown</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Dubos" title="René Dubos">René Dubos</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Dillon_Ripley" title="Sidney Dillon Ripley">Sidney Ripley</a> that did not come to pass. <a href="/wiki/Neal_Koblitz" title="Neal Koblitz">Neal Koblitz</a> classified equations of this type as "mathematical <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>" and criticized Ehrlich's use of them in the media (e.g. on <a href="/wiki/The_Tonight_Show" title="The Tonight Show">The Tonight Show</a>) to sway the general public.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kaya_identity" title="Kaya identity">Kaya identity</a> is closely related to the I = PAT equation. The I = PAT equation is more general, describing an abstract "impact".

<p>In the <b>I=PAT</b> equation, the variable <b>P</b> represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> and many others to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see <a href="/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model" title="Malthusian growth model">Malthusian growth model</a>).</p>
<p>The United Nations and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_Census_Bureau" title="US Census Bureau">US Census Bureau</a> project that world population will increase from 7.4 billion today in 2016 (up from 7.0 billion forecast in 2005) to about 9.7 billion by 2050 (up from 9.2 billion). These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of <a href="/wiki/Demographic_transition" title="Demographic transition">demographic transition</a> all over the world. The UN projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion by 2100 (up from 9.2 billion). However, since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades, this factor of the <b>I=PAT</b> equation will likely keep increasing <a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">human impact on the environment</a> for the near future.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_Impacts">Environmental Impacts</span></h3>
<p>Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased <a href="/wiki/Land_use" title="Land use">land use</a> - Results in habitat loss for other species.</li>
<li>Increased <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Resource_use&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Resource use (page does not exist)">resource use</a> - Results in changes in land cover</li>
<li>Increased <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> - Can cause sickness and damages <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Affluence">Affluence</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">Consumption (economics)</a></div>

<p>The variable <b>A</b>, in the <b>I=PAT</b> equation stands for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Affluence" title="Affluence">affluence</a>. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GDP_per_capita" title="GDP per capita">GDP per capita</a>. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases. GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the <b>I=PAT</b> equation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_Impacts_2">Environmental Impacts</span></h3>
<p>Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide ranging effects on the environment. For example, if the construction of a car had the following environmental impacts among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires</li>
<li>682 lbs. of pollution at a mine for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lead_battery" title="Lead battery">lead battery</a>.</li>
<li>2178 lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22 lbs. of copper contained in the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>then the more cars per capita, the greater the impact. Since the ecological impacts of each product are far reaching, increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technology">Technology</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_technology" title="Environmental technology">Environmental technology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Appropriate_technology" title="Appropriate technology">Appropriate technology</a></div>
<p>The <b>T</b> variable in the <b>I=PAT</b> equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used. Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier. Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for <b>T</b> is often tailored for the situation <b>I=PAT</b> is being applied to. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for <b>T</b> might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_Impacts_3">Environmental Impacts</span></h3>
<p>Increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact. However, since <b>P</b> has increased exponentially, and <b>A</b> has also increased drastically, the overall environmental impact, <b>I</b>, has still increased.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<p>The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least 7 interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T). For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the <a href="/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)" title="Rebound effect (conservation)">rebound effect (conservation)</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jevons_Paradox" title="Jevons Paradox">Jevons Paradox</a>. As was shown by Alcott, despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy and materials use efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.</p>
<p>As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Population_control" title="Population control">population control</a> and material sufficiency and <a href="/wiki/Degrowth" title="Degrowth">degrowth</a> movements have been very controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or <a href="/wiki/Pigovian_tax" title="Pigovian tax">Pigouvian taxation</a> of resource use or pollution.</p>
