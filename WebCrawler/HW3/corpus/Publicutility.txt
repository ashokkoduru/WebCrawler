<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, public utilities are often <a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopolies</a> because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain. As a result, they are often government monopolies, or if privately owned, the sectors are specially <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulated</a> by a <a href="/wiki/Public_utilities_commission" title="Public utilities commission">public utilities commission</a>. The first public utility in the United States was a grist mill on <a href="/wiki/Mother_Brook" title="Mother Brook">Mother Brook</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dedham,_Massachusetts" title="Dedham, Massachusetts">Dedham, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>Developments in technology have eroded some of the natural monopoly aspects of traditional public utilities. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electricity_retailing" title="Electricity retailing">electricity retailing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telecommunication" title="Telecommunication">telecommunication</a>, some types of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_transit" title="Public transit">public transit</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mail" title="Mail">postal services</a> have become competitive in some countries and the trend towards <a href="/wiki/Liberalization" title="Liberalization">liberalization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deregulation" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Privatization" title="Privatization">privatization</a> of public utilities is growing, but the network infrastructure used to distribute most utility products and services has remained largely monopolistic.</p>
<p><b>Public utilities can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Private_company" title="Private company">privately owned</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government-owned_company" title="Government-owned company">publicly owned</a>.</b> Publicly owned utilities include cooperative and municipal utilities. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Municipal" title="Municipal">Municipal</a> utilities may actually include territories outside of city limits or may not even serve the entire city. <a href="/wiki/Utility_cooperative" title="Utility cooperative">Cooperative utilities</a> are owned by the customers they serve. They are usually found in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rural" title="Rural">rural</a> areas. Publicly owned utilities are non-profit. Private utilities, also called <a href="/wiki/Investor-owned_utility" title="Investor-owned utility">investor-owned utilities</a>, are owned by <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investors</a>, and operate for profit, often referred to as a rate of return.</p>
<p>Public utilities provide services at the consumer level, be it residential, commercial, or industrial consumer. In turn, utilities and very large consumers buy and sell electricity at the wholesale level through a network of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regional_transmission_organization" title="Regional transmission organization">RTOs</a> and ISOs within one of three grids, the eastern grid, Texas, which is a single ISO, and the western grid.</p>
