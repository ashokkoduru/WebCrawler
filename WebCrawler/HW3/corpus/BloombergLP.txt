<p>In 1981, <a href="/wiki/Salomon_Brothers" title="Salomon Brothers">Salomon Brothers</a> was acquired, and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg" title="Michael Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a>, a general partner, was given a $10 million partnership settlement. Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, used his $10 million severance check to start Innovative Market Systems (IMS). Bloomberg developed and built his own computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> firms. In 1983, Merrill Lynch invested $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of "the Bloomberg" terminal computer system and by 1984, IMS was selling machines to all of Merrill Lynch's clients.</p>
<p>In 1986, the company was renamed Bloomberg L.P., and 5,000 terminals had been installed in subscribers' offices. Within a few years, ancillary products including <a href="/wiki/Bloomberg_Tradebook" title="Bloomberg Tradebook">Bloomberg Tradebook</a> (a trading platform), the Bloomberg Messaging Service, and the Bloomberg newswire were launched.
