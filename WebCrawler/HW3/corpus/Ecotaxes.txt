<p>An <b>Ecotax</b> (short for <b>ecological taxation</b>) is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taxation" title="Taxation">tax</a> levied on activities which are considered to be harmful to the environment and is intended to promote environmentally friendly activities via economic incentives. Such a policy can complement or avert the need for regulatory (command and control) approaches. Often, an ecotax policy proposal may attempt to maintain overall tax revenue by proportionately reducing other taxes (e.g. taxes on human labor and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_resources" title="Renewable resources">renewable resources</a>); such proposals are known as a <b>green tax shift</b> towards ecological taxation. Ecotaxes address the failure of <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free markets</a> to consider <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_impact" title="Environmental impact">environmental impacts</a>.</p>
<p>Ecotaxes are examples of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pigouvian_tax" title="Pigouvian tax">Pigouvian taxes</a>, which are <i>taxes that attempt to make the private parties involved feel the social burden of their actions</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_frameworks_and_strategies_employing_tax_shifting_and_ecotaxes">Economic frameworks and strategies employing tax shifting and ecotaxes</span></h2>
<p>The object of a green tax shift is often to implement a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Full_cost_accounting" title="Full cost accounting">full cost accounting</a>" or "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/True_cost_accounting" title="True cost accounting">true cost accounting</a>", using fiscal policy to internalize market distorting externalities, which leads to <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainable</a> <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">wealth</a> creation. The broader measures required for this are also sometimes called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecological_fiscal_reform" title="Ecological fiscal reform">ecological fiscal reform</a>, especially in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, where the government has generally employed this terminology. In some countries the name is <a href="/wiki/Eco-social_market_economy" title="Eco-social market economy">eco-social market economy</a>.</p>
<p>Tax shifting usually includes balancing taxation levels to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fiscal_neutrality" title="Fiscal neutrality">revenue-neutral</a> for <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a> and to maintain overall <a href="/wiki/Progressive_tax" title="Progressive tax">progressiveness</a>. It also usually includes measures to protect the most vulnerable, such as raising the minimum income to file income tax at all, or an increase to pension and social assistance levels to offset increased costs of fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Basic economic theory recognizes the existence of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Externalities" title="Externalities">externalities</a> and their potential negative effects. To the extent that green taxes correct for externalities such as pollution, they correspond with mainstream economic theory. In practice, however, setting the correct taxation level or the tax collection system needed to do so is difficult, and may lead to further distortions or unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Taxes on consumption may take the "<a href="/wiki/Feebate" title="Feebate">feebate</a>" approach advocated by <a href="/wiki/Amory_Lovins" title="Amory Lovins">Amory Lovins</a>, in which additional fees on less sustainable products — such as <a href="/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" title="Sport utility vehicle">sport utility vehicles</a> — are pooled to fund subsidies on more sustainable alternatives, such as <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle" title="Hybrid electric vehicle">hybrid electric vehicles</a>.</p>
<p>However, they may simply act as incentives to change habits and make capital investments in newer more efficient vehicles or appliances or to upgrade buildings. Small changes in corporate tax rates for instance can radically change <a href="/wiki/Return_on_investment" title="Return on investment">return on investment</a> of capital projects, especially if the averted costs of future fossil fuel use are taken into account.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to major consumer purchases. A "<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Green_mortgage&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Green mortgage (page does not exist)">green mortgage</a>" such as a <a href="/wiki/Location_Efficient_Mortgage" title="Location Efficient Mortgage">Location Efficient Mortgage</a>, for example, recognizes that persons who do not drive cars and live generally energy-efficient lifestyles pay far less per month than others and accordingly have more to pay a heftier mortgage bill with. This justifies lending them much more money to upgrade a house to use even less energy overall. The result is a bank taking more per month from a consumer's income as utilities and car insurance companies take less, and housing stock upgraded to use the minimum energy feasible with current technology.</p>
<p>Aside from energy, the refits will generally be those required to be maximally accommodating to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telework" title="Telework">telework</a>, <a href="/wiki/Permaculture" title="Permaculture">permaculture</a> gardens (for example <a href="/wiki/Green_roof" title="Green roof">green roofs</a>), and a lifestyle that is generally localized in the community not based on commuting. The last, especially, raises real state valuations for not only the neighborhood but the entire surrounding region. Consumers living sustainable lifestyles in upgraded housing will generally be unwilling to drive around aimlessly shopping, for instance, to save a few dollars on their purchases. Instead, they'll stay nearer to home and create jobs in grocery delivery and small organic grocers, spending substantially less money on gasoline and car operation costs even if they pay more for food.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Progressive_or_regressive.3F">Progressive or regressive?</span></h2>
<p>Some green tax shift proposals have been criticized as being fiscally <a href="/wiki/Regressive_tax" title="Regressive tax">regressive</a> (a tax with an average tax rate that decreases as the taxpayer's income increases). Taxing negative externalities usually entails exerting a burden on consumption, and since the poor consume more and save or invest less as a share of their income, any shift towards <a href="/wiki/Consumption_tax" title="Consumption tax">consumption taxes</a> can be regressive. In 2004, research by the <a href="/wiki/Policy_Studies_Institute" title="Policy Studies Institute">Policy Studies Institute</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Rowntree_Foundation" title="Joseph Rowntree Foundation">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> indicated that flat rate taxes on domestic rubbish, energy, water and transport use would have a relatively higher impact on poorer households.</p>
<p>However, conventional regulatory approaches can affect prices in much the same way, while lacking the revenue-recycling potential of ecotaxes. Moreover, correctly assessing distributive impact of any tax shift requires an analysis of the specific instrument design features. For example, tax revenue could be redistributed on a per capita basis as part of a <a href="/wiki/Basic_income" title="Basic income">basic income</a> scheme; in this case, the poorest would gain what the average citizen pays as ecotaxes, minus their own small contribution (no car, small apartment, ...). This design would be highly progressive. Alternatively, an ecotax can have a "lifeline" design, in which modest consumption levels are priced relatively low (even zero, in the case of water), and higher consumption levels are priced at a higher rate. Furthermore, an ecotax policy package can include revenue recycling to reduce or eliminate any regressivity; an increase in an ecotax could be more than offset by a decrease in a (regressive) payroll or consumption tax. Some proponents claim a second benefit of increased employment or lower health care costs as the market and society adjust to the new fiscal policy (these claims, as with the claim "tax cuts create jobs," are often difficult to prove or disprove even after the fact).</p>
<p>Furthermore, pollution and other forms of environmental harm are often felt more acutely by the poor, who cannot "buy their way out" of being receptors of air pollution, water pollution, etc. Such losses, although <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Externalities" title="Externalities">externalities</a>, have real economic welfare impacts. Thus by reducing environmental harm, such instruments have a progressive effect.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecotax_policies_enacted">Ecotax policies enacted</span></h2>

<p>An ecotax has been enacted in <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> by means of three laws in 1998, 1999 and 2002. The first introduced a tax on electricity and petroleum, at variable rates based on environmental considerations; renewable sources of electricity were not taxed. The second adjusted the taxes to favor efficient conventional power plants. The third increased the tax on petroleum. At the same time, <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income taxes</a> were reduced proportionally so that the total tax burden remained constant.</p>
<p>The regional government of <a href="/wiki/Balearic_Islands" title="Balearic Islands">Balearic Islands</a> (then held by an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosocialist" title="Ecosocialist">ecosocialist</a> coalition) established an ecotax in 1999. The Balearic Island suffer a high human pressure from tourism, that at the same time provides the main source of income. The tax (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%E2%82%AC" title="€">€</a>1.00 per person per day) would be paid by visitors staying at tourist resorts. This was criticized by the conservative opposition as contrary to business interests, and they abolished the tax in 2003 after seizing back the government.</p>
<p>A variety of ecotaxes (often called "severance taxes") have been enacted by various states in the United States. The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> held in <i><a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Edison_Co._v._Montana" title="Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana">Commonwealth Edison Co. v.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Registration_taxes">Registration taxes</span></h3>
<p>The Netherlands, Portugal, Canada, Spain and Finland have introduced differentiations into their car registration taxes to encourage car buyers to opt for the cleanest car models.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the new registration taxes, payable when a car is sold to its first buyer, can earn the owner of a hybrid a discount up to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%E2%82%AC" title="€">€</a>6000. Spain reduced taxes for cars that produced less CO2 (some of which will be exempted), while the more consuming, like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Special_purpose_vehicle" title="Special purpose vehicle">SPV</a> and <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">4WD</a> saw their taxes increased.</p>
<p>Austria has had a registration tax based on fuel consumption for several years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Worldwide_implementation">Worldwide implementation</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>In 1993, the conservative government introduced the <a href="/wiki/Fuel_Price_Escalator" title="Fuel Price Escalator">Fuel Price Escalator</a>, featuring a small but steady increase of fuel taxes, as proposed by Weizsäcker and Jesinghaus in 1992. The FPE was stopped in 2000, following nationwide protests; while fuel was relatively cheap in 1993, fuel prices were then among the highest in Europe. Under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blair-Brown_government" title="Blair-Brown government">Blair-Brown government</a>, despite <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>’s promise to the contrary, green taxes as a percentage of overall taxes have actually fallen from 9.4% to 7.7%, according to calculations by <a href="/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth" title="Friends of the Earth">Friends of the Earth</a>.</p>
<p>In a 2006 proposal, the U.K.'s then-<a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs" title="Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Environment Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Miliband" title="David Miliband">David Miliband</a> had the government in discussions on the use of various green taxes to reduce <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">climate-changing pollution</a>. Of the proposed taxes, which were meant to be revenue-neutral, Miliband stated: <i>"They're not fundamentally there to raise revenue."</i></p>
<p>Miliband provided additional comments on their need, saying: <i>"Changing people's behaviour is only achieved by "market forces and price signals"</i>, and <i>"As our understanding of climate change increases, it is clear more needs to be done."</i></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ukraine">Ukraine</span></h3>
<p>Starting in 1999, the Ukrainian government has been collecting an ecological tax, officially known as Environmental Pollution Fee (<a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_language" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian</a>: <span lang="uk" xml:lang="uk">Збір за забруднення навколишнього природного середовища</span>), which is collected from all polluting entities, whether it's one-time or ongoing pollution and regardless of whether the polluting act was legal or illegal at the time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="India">India</span></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, asked Madras School of Economics, Chennai, to undertake a study of taxes on polluting inputs and outputs in 2001. Raja Chelliah, Paul Appasamy, U.Sankar and Rita Pandey (Academic Foundation, 2007, New Delhi) recommended eco taxes on coal, automobiles, chlorine,phosphate detergents,chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers, lead acid batteries and plastics.See Ecotaxes on polluting inputs and outputs, Academic Foundation, New Delhi,2007. The Finance Minister introduced a coal cess at the rate of Rs 50 per ton in 2010.</p>
