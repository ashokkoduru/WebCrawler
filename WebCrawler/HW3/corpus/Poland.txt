<p>Historians have postulated that throughout <a href="/wiki/Late_Antiquity" title="Late Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>, many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now Poland. The <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_group" title="Ethnic group">ethnicity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistic</a> affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated; the time and route of the original settlement of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slavic_peoples" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> in these regions lacks written records and can only be defined as fragmented.</p>
<p>The most famous archaeological find from <a href="/wiki/Prehistory_and_protohistory_of_Poland" title="Prehistory and protohistory of Poland">the prehistory and protohistory of Poland</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Biskupin" title="Biskupin">Biskupin</a> fortified settlement (now reconstructed as an open-air museum), dating from the <a href="/wiki/Lusatian_culture" title="Lusatian culture">Lusatian culture</a> of the early <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, around 700 BC.

<p>Poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and <a href="/wiki/Territorial_entity" title="Territorial entity">territorial entity</a> around the middle of the 10th century under the <a href="/wiki/Piast_dynasty" title="Piast dynasty">Piast dynasty</a>.

The bulk of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baptism_of_Poland" title="Baptism of Poland">the population converted</a> in the course of the next few centuries. In 1000, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_I_Chrobry" title="Bolesław I Chrobry">Boleslaw the Brave</a>, continuing the policy of his father Mieszko, held a <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Gniezno" title="Congress of Gniezno">Congress of Gniezno</a> and created the <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(religious_jurisdiction)" title="Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)">metropolis</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gniezno" title="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Diocese" title="Diocese">dioceses</a> of <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ko%C5%82obrzeg" title="Kołobrzeg">Kołobrzeg</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw" title="Wrocław">Wrocław</a>. However, the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by <a href="/wiki/Casimir_I_the_Restorer" title="Casimir I the Restorer">Casimir I the Restorer</a>.</p>

<p>In 1109, Prince <a href="/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_III_Wrymouth" title="Bolesław III Wrymouth">Bolesław III Wrymouth</a> defeated the King of Germany <a href="/wiki/Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor">Henry V</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hundsfeld" title="Battle of Hundsfeld">Battle of Hundsfeld</a>, stopping the German march into Poland.

In 1138, Poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when Bolesław divided his lands among his sons. In 1226, <a href="/wiki/Konrad_I_of_Masovia" title="Konrad I of Masovia">Konrad I of Masovia</a>, one of the regional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Piast" title="Piast">Piast</a> dukes, invited the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Teutonic_Knights" title="Teutonic Knights">Teutonic Knights</a> to help him fight the <a href="/wiki/Balts" title="Balts">Baltic</a> <a href="/wiki/Old_Prussians" title="Old Prussians">Prussian</a> pagans; a decision which led to centuries of warfare with the Knights. In 1264, the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Kalisz" title="Statute of Kalisz">Statute of Kalisz</a> or the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous right for the Jews in Poland, leading to a nearly autonomous "nation within a nation".</p>
<p>In the middle of the 13th century, the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Henry_I_the_Bearded" title="Henry I the Bearded">Henry I the Bearded</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henry_II_the_Pious" title="Henry II the Pious">Henry II the Pious</a>, ruled 1238–41) nearly succeeded in uniting the Polish lands, but the <a href="/wiki/First_Mongol_invasion_of_Poland" title="First Mongol invasion of Poland">Mongols</a> invaded the country from the east and defeated the combined Polish forces at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Legnica" title="Battle of Legnica">Battle of Legnica</a> where Duke Henry II the Pious died. In 1320, after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the Polish dukedoms, <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_I_the_Elbow-high" title="Władysław I the Elbow-high">Władysław I</a> consolidated his power, took the throne and became the first king of <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)" title="Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)">a reunified Poland</a>. His son, <a href="/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great" title="Casimir III the Great">Casimir III</a> (reigned 1333–70), has a reputation as one of the greatest Polish kings, and gained wide recognition for improving the country's infrastructure. He also extended royal protection to <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a>, and encouraged their immigration to Poland. Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Golden_Liberty" title="Golden Liberty">Golden Liberty</a> of the nobles began to develop under Casimir's rule, when in return for their <a href="/wiki/Pospolite_ruszenie" title="Pospolite ruszenie">military support</a>, the king made a series of concessions to the nobility, and establishing their legal status as superior to that of the townsmen. When Casimir the Great died in 1370, leaving no legitimate male heir, the <a href="/wiki/Piast_dynasty" title="Piast dynasty">Piast dynasty</a> came to an end.</p>
<p>During the 12th and 13th centuries, Poland became a destination for German, Flemish and to a lesser extent Scottish, Danish and Walloon migrants. Also, the Jews and Armenians began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era (see <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armenians_in_Poland" title="Armenians in Poland">Armenians in Poland</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, a plague that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not significantly affect Poland, and the country was spared from a major outbreak of the disease.

The <i><a href="/wiki/Nihil_novi" title="Nihil novi">Nihil novi</a></i> act adopted by the Polish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_sejm" title="General sejm">Sejm</a> (parliament) in 1505, transferred most of the <a href="/wiki/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislative power</a> from the monarch to the Sejm, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as "Golden Liberty", when the state was ruled by the "free and equal" <a href="/wiki/Szlachta" title="Szlachta">Polish nobility</a>. <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_toleration" title="Religious toleration">religious tolerance</a>, unique in Europe at that time. This tolerance allowed the country to avoid most the religious turmoil that spread over Europe during the 16th century.</p>
<p>The European <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_I_the_Old" title="Sigismund I the Old">Sigismund I the Old</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_II_Augustus" title="Sigismund II Augustus">Sigismund II Augustus</a>) a sense of urgency in the need to promote a <a href="/wiki/Renaissance_in_Poland" title="Renaissance in Poland">cultural awakening</a>, and during this period Polish culture and the nation's economy flourished.

The <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Confederation" title="Warsaw Confederation">Warsaw Confederation</a> (1573) confirmed the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_freedom" title="Religious freedom">religious freedom</a> of all residents of Poland, which was extremely important for the stability of the multiethnic Polish society of the time. <a href="/wiki/Serfdom" title="Serfdom">Serfdom</a> was banned in 1588. The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in Poland, with the union thereafter becoming a European power and a major cultural entity, occupying approximately one million square kilometers of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as an agent for the dissemination of <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western culture</a> through <a href="/wiki/Polonization" title="Polonization">Polonization</a> into areas of modern-day Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus and Western Russia.</p>
<p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, <a href="/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">Poland</a> suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Vasa" title="House of Vasa">Vasa</a> kings <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_III_Vasa" title="Sigismund III Vasa">Sigismund III</a> and <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_IV_Vasa" title="Władysław IV Vasa">Władysław IV</a> and found itself engaged in major conflicts with <a href="/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia" title="Tsardom of Russia">Russia</a>, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, as well as a series of minor <a href="/wiki/Cossacks" title="Cossacks">Cossack</a> uprisings. In 1610 <a href="/wiki/Hetman" title="Hetman">Hetman</a> <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_%C5%BB%C3%B3%C5%82kiewski" title="Stanisław Żółkiewski">Stanisław Żółkiewski</a> seized Moscow after winning the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Klushino" title="Battle of Klushino">Battle of Klushino</a>.</p>

<p>From the middle of the 17th century, the nobles' democracy, suffering from internal disorder, gradually declined, thus leaving the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention. Starting in 1648, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cossack" title="Cossack">Cossack</a> <a href="/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising" title="Khmelnytsky Uprising">Khmelnytsky Uprising</a> engulfed the south and east eventually leaving <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was followed by the <a href="/wiki/Deluge_(history)" title="Deluge (history)">'Deluge', a Swedish invasion</a> of Poland, which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the country's population, culture and infrastructure. Around four million of Poland's eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics. However, under <a href="/wiki/John_III_Sobieski" title="John III Sobieski">John III Sobieski</a> the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna" title="Battle of Vienna">Battle of Vienna</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Army_(15th-19th_centuries)" title="Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)">Ottoman Army</a>, commanded by <a href="/wiki/Kara_Mustafa_Pasha" title="Kara Mustafa Pasha">Kara Mustafa</a> the grand vizier of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.</p>

<p>Sobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden-era. Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lubomirski_Rebellion" title="Lubomirski Rebellion">Lubomirski Rebellion</a> against <a href="/wiki/John_II_Casimir_Vasa" title="John II Casimir Vasa">John II Casimir</a> and rebellious <a href="/wiki/Confederation_(Poland)" title="Confederation (Poland)">confederations</a>) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnat_(Poland)" title="Magnat (Poland)">magnats</a></i>, and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the <a href="/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony" title="Electorate of Saxony">Saxon</a> <a href="/wiki/House_of_Wettin" title="House of Wettin">Wettin dynasty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Augustus_II_the_Strong" title="Augustus II the Strong">Augustus II</a> and <a href="/wiki/Augustus_III_of_Poland" title="Augustus III of Poland">Augustus III</a>, as well as the rise of <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern_War" title="Great Northern War">Great Northern War</a> only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight. Despite this The Commonwealth-Saxony <a href="/wiki/Personal_union" title="Personal union">personal union</a> gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealth's first reform movement, and laid the foundations for the <a href="/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Poland" title="Enlightenment in Poland">Polish Enlightenment</a>.</p>

<p>During the later part of the 18th century, the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms; with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy, significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art, and especially toward the end of the period, evolution of the social and political system. The most populous capital city of <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> replaced <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a> (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Royal_elections_in_Poland" title="Royal elections in Poland">royal election</a> of 1764 resulted in the elevation of <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_August_Poniatowski" title="Stanisław August Poniatowski">Stanisław II August</a>, a Polish aristocrat connected to major <a href="/wiki/Magnate" title="Magnate">magnate</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Czartoryski_family" title="Czartoryski family">factions</a>, to the monarchy. However, a one-time lover of Empress <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catherine_II_of_Russia" title="Catherine II of Russia">Catherine II of Russia</a>, the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768 <a href="/wiki/Bar_Confederation" title="Bar Confederation">Bar Confederation</a>, a <i>szlachta</i> rebellion directed against Russia and the Polish king that fought to preserve Poland's independence and the <i>szlachta'</i>s traditional privileges. Attempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the <a href="/wiki/First_Partition_of_Poland" title="First Partition of Poland">First Partition of the Commonwealth</a> by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the "<a href="/wiki/Partition_Sejm" title="Partition Sejm">Partition Sejm</a>", under considerable duress, eventually "ratified" <i>fait accompli</i>. Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the <a href="/wiki/Commission_of_National_Education" title="Commission of National Education">Commission of National Education</a>, the first government education authority in Europe. <a href="/wiki/Corporal_punishment" title="Corporal punishment">Corporal punishment</a> of children was officially prohibited in 1783.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Great_Sejm" title="Great Sejm">Great Sejm</a> convened by Stanisław II August in 1788 successfully adopted the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_May_3,_1791" title="Constitution of May 3, 1791">3 May Constitution</a>, the first set of modern supreme national laws in Europe. However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the <a href="/wiki/Targowica_Confederation" title="Targowica Confederation">Targowica Confederation</a>, an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the <a href="/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Russian_War_of_1792" title="Polish–Russian War of 1792">Polish-Russian War</a>.</p>
<p>The defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Partition_of_Poland" title="Second Partition of Poland">Second Partition of the Commonwealth</a>, which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence. Eventually, in 1795, following the failed <a href="/wiki/Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Uprising" title="Kościuszko Uprising">Kościuszko Uprising</a>, the Commonwealth was <a href="/wiki/Third_Partition_of_Poland" title="Third Partition of Poland">partitioned one last time</a> by all three of its more powerful neighbours, and with this, effectively ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Poles <a href="/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Poland" title="List of wars involving Poland">rebelled several times against the partitioners</a>, particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in 1794 during the <a href="/wiki/Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Uprising" title="Kościuszko Uprising">Kościuszko Uprising</a>, where a popular and distinguished general <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tadeusz_Kosciuszko" title="Tadeusz Kosciuszko">Tadeusz Kosciuszko</a>, who had several years earlier served under <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">Washington</a> in the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, led Polish insurrectionists against numerically superior Russian forces.

<p>In 1807, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon I of France</a> temporarily recreated a Polish state as the satellite <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Warsaw" title="Duchy of Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a>, after a successful <a href="/wiki/Greater_Poland_Uprising_(1806)" title="Greater Poland Uprising (1806)">Greater Poland Uprising of 1806</a> against Prussian rule. But, after the failed <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Poland was again split between the victorious powers at the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> of 1815. The eastern part was ruled by the Russian <a href="/wiki/Tsar" title="Tsar">tsar</a> as <a href="/wiki/Congress_Poland" title="Congress Poland">Congress Poland</a>, which had a very <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland" title="Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland">liberal constitution</a>. However, over time the Russian tsar reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Meanwhile, the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization. Thus, in the 19th century, only Austrian ruled <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galicia_(Central_Europe)" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a>, and particularly the <a href="/wiki/Free_City_of_Krak%C3%B3w" title="Free City of Kraków">Free City of Kraków</a>, allowed free Polish culture to flourish.</p>

<p>Throughout the period of the partitions, political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian, Prussian and Austrian governments.</p>
<p>In 1830, the <a href="/wiki/November_Uprising" title="November Uprising">November Uprising</a> began in <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> when, led by Lieutenant <a href="/wiki/Piotr_Wysocki" title="Piotr Wysocki">Piotr Wysocki</a>, young <a href="/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer" title="Non-commissioned officer">non-commissioned officers</a> at the <a class="extiw" href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szko%C5%82a_Podchor%C4%85%C5%BCych_w_Warszawie" title="pl:Szkoła Podchorążych w Warszawie">Officer Cadet School</a> in Warsaw revolted. They were joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal <a href="/wiki/Hans_Karl_von_Diebitsch" title="Hans Karl von Diebitsch">Hans Karl von Diebitsch</a> and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ivan_Paskievich" title="Ivan Paskievich">Ivan Paskievich</a>, many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spring_of_Nations" title="Spring of Nations">Spring of Nations</a> (a series of revolutions which swept across Europe), Poles took up arms in the <a href="/wiki/Greater_Poland_Uprising_(1848)" title="Greater Poland Uprising (1848)">Greater Poland Uprising of 1848</a> to resist Prussian rule. Initially, the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience, but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the Prussian military was sent in to pacify the region. Eventually, after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the Prussians, and the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Posen" title="Grand Duchy of Posen">Grand Duchy of Posen</a> was stripped of its autonomy and completely incorporated into the <a href="/wiki/German_Confederation" title="German Confederation">German Confederation</a>.</p>
<p>In 1863, a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began. The <a href="/wiki/January_Uprising" title="January Uprising">January Uprising</a> started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against <a href="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">conscription</a> into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement.</p>
<p>Despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity. This was particularly true in Greater Poland, Silesia and Eastern Pomerania controlled by Prussia (later becoming a part of the <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" title="German Empire">German Empire</a>); areas which eventually, thanks largely to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greater_Poland_Uprising_(1918%E2%80%931919)" title="Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)">Greater Poland Uprising of 1918</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silesian_Uprisings" title="Silesian Uprisings">Silesian Uprisings</a>, were reconstituted as a part of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" title="Second Polish Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>, becoming the country's most prosperous regions.</p>

<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, all the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I" title="Allies of World War I">Allies</a> agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> proclaimed in Point 13 of his <a href="/wiki/Fourteen_Points" title="Fourteen Points">Fourteen Points</a>. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Shortly after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Armistice_with_Germany_(Compi%C3%A8gne)" title="Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)">armistice with Germany in November 1918</a>, Poland regained its independence as the <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" title="Second Polish Republic">Second Polish Republic</a> (<i>II Rzeczpospolita Polska</i>). It reaffirmed its independence after <a href="/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Poland" title="List of wars involving Poland">a series of military conflicts</a>, the most notable being the <a href="/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War" title="Polish–Soviet War">Polish–Soviet War</a> (1919–21) when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a>, an event which is considered to have halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism. The event is often referred to as the "Miracle at the Vistula".</p>

<p>During this period, Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state. Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a <a href="/wiki/Gdynia" title="Gdynia">major seaport</a> was opened on the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a> Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged <a href="/wiki/Free_City_of_Danzig" title="Free City of Danzig">Free City of Danzig</a>.</p>
<p>The inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_World_War" title="First World War">First World War</a>, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as <a href="/wiki/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski" title="Ignacy Jan Paderewski">Ignacy Paderewski</a> (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Narutowicz" title="Gabriel Narutowicz">Gabriel Narutowicz</a>, inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the <a href="/wiki/Zach%C4%99ta" title="Zachęta">Zachęta Gallery</a> in Warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist <a href="/wiki/Eligiusz_Niewiadomski" title="Eligiusz Niewiadomski">Eligiusz Niewiadomski</a>.</p>
<p>The 1926 <a href="/wiki/May_Coup_(Poland)" title="May Coup (Poland)">May Coup</a> of <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski" title="Józef Piłsudski">Józef Piłsudski</a> turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sanacja" title="Sanacja">Sanacja</a> movement. By the 1930s Poland had become increasingly authoritarian; a number of 'undesirable' political parties, such as the Polish Communists, had been banned and following Piłsudski's death, the regime, unable to appoint a new leader, began to show its inherent internal weaknesses and unwillingness to cooperate in any way with other political parties.</p>
<p>As result of the <a href="/wiki/Munich_Agreement" title="Munich Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> in 1938, major European powers (Germany, France, Britain and Italy) awarded Poland the small 350 sq mi <a href="/wiki/Zaolzie" title="Zaolzie">Zaolzie Region</a> of Czechoslovakia.

German planners had in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction" of all <a href="/wiki/Poles" title="Poles">Poles</a> and their fate, as well as many other <a href="/wiki/Slavs" title="Slavs">Slavs</a>, was outlined in genocidal <i><a href="/wiki/Generalplan_Ost" title="Generalplan Ost">Generalplan Ost</a></i>.</p>

<p>During the war, Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution to <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">the Allied</a> war effort, after the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviets</a>, the British, and the Americans. Polish troops fought under the command of both the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polish_Government_in_Exile" title="Polish Government in Exile">Polish Government in Exile</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces_in_the_West" title="Polish Armed Forces in the West">west</a> and under Soviet leadership in the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces_in_the_East" title="Polish Armed Forces in the East">east</a>. The Polish expeditionary corps, which was controlled by the exiled pre-war government based in London, played an important role in the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)" title="Italian Campaign (World War II)">Italian</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_African_Campaign" title="North African Campaign">North African Campaigns</a>. They are particularly well remembered for their conduct at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino" title="Battle of Monte Cassino">Battle of Monte Cassino</a>, a conflict which culminated in the raising of a Polish flag over the ruins of the mountain-top abbey by the <a href="/wiki/II_Corps_(Poland)" title="II Corps (Poland)">12th Podolian Uhlans</a>. The Polish forces in the west were commanded by Lieutenant General <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Anders" title="Władysław Anders">Władysław Anders</a>, who had received his command from <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Poland" title="Prime Minister of Poland">prime minister</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" title="Polish government-in-exile">exiled government</a> <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Sikorski" title="Władysław Sikorski">Władysław Sikorski</a>. In the east, the Soviet-backed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_Polish_Army_(1944-1945)" title="First Polish Army (1944-1945)">Polish 1st Army</a> distinguished itself in the battles for <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising" title="Warsaw Uprising">Warsaw</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin" title="Battle of Berlin">Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>Polish servicemen were also active in the theatres of naval and air warfare; during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Britain" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a> Polish squadrons such as the <a href="/wiki/No._303_Polish_Fighter_Squadron" title="No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron">No. 303 "Kościuszko" fighter squadron</a> achieved considerable success, and by the end of the war the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Air_Forces_in_France_and_Great_Britain" title="Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain">exiled Polish Air Forces</a> could claim 769 confirmed kills. Meanwhile, the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Navy" title="Polish Navy">Polish Navy</a> was active in the protection of convoys in the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> and Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>In addition to the organised units of the 1st Army and the Forces in the Nazi-occupied Europe, the domestic underground resistance movement, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" title="Armia Krajowa">Armia Krajowa</a> (<i>Home Army</i>), fought against the German occupation. The <a href="/wiki/Polish_resistance_movement_in_World_War_II" title="Polish resistance movement in World War II">wartime resistance movement</a> in Poland was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war, and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities, which essentially functioned as an <a href="/wiki/Polish_Underground_State" title="Polish Underground State">underground state</a> complete with <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Poland_during_World_War_II" title="Education in Poland during World War II">degree-awarding universities</a> and <a href="/wiki/Special_Courts" title="Special Courts">a court system</a>. The resistance was, however, largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 they initiated <a href="/wiki/Operation_Tempest" title="Operation Tempest">Operation Tempest</a>, of which the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising" title="Warsaw Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> that begun on 1 August 1944 was the best known operation. The objective of the uprising was to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a>. However, secondary motives for the uprising sought to see Warsaw liberated before the Soviets could reach the capital, so as to underscore Polish <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a> by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet-backed <a href="/wiki/Polish_Committee_of_National_Liberation" title="Polish Committee of National Liberation">Polish Committee of National Liberation</a> could assume control. However, a lack of available allied military aid and Stalin's reluctance to allow the 1st Army to help their fellow countrymen take the city, led to the uprising's failure and subsequent <a href="/wiki/Planned_destruction_of_Warsaw" title="Planned destruction of Warsaw">planned destruction of the city</a>.</p>

<p>During the war, German forces under direct order from <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> set up six major <a href="/wiki/Extermination_camp" title="Extermination camp">extermination camps</a>, all of which operated in the heart of Poland. They included the notorious <a href="/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp" title="Treblinka extermination camp">Treblinka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Majdanek_concentration_camp" title="Majdanek concentration camp">Majdanek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz</a> killing centers. This allowed the Germans to <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_train" title="Holocaust train">transport the condemned Jews</a> under the guise of resettlement from the Third Reich and across occupied Europe, and systematically murder them in the death camps set up in the <a href="/wiki/Polish_areas_annexed_by_Nazi_Germany" title="Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany">Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany</a>.</p>
<p>The Nazi crimes against the Polish nation claimed the lives of 2.9 million Polish Jews, and 2.8 million ethnic Poles, including Polish academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility, priests and numerous others. Since 3,5 million Jews lived in pre-war Poland, Jewish victims make up the largest percentage of all victims of the Nazis' extermination program. It is estimated that, of pre-war Poland's Jewry, approximately 90% were killed. Throughout the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Occupation_of_Poland_(1939%E2%80%931945)" title="Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)">occupation</a>, many members of the Armia Krajowa, supported by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polish_government_in_exile" title="Polish government in exile">Polish government in exile</a>, and millions of ordinary Poles – at great risk to themselves and their families – <a href="/wiki/Rescue_of_Jews_by_Poles_during_the_Holocaust" title="Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust">engaged in rescuing Jews from the Nazi Germans</a>. Grouped by nationality, Poles represent the largest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. To date, 6,620 Poles have been awarded the title of <i><a href="/wiki/Polish_Righteous_Among_the_Nations" title="Polish Righteous Among the Nations">Righteous Among the Nations</a></i> by the State of <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>–more than any other nation. Some estimates put the number of Poles involved in rescue efforts at up to 3 million, and credit Poles with sheltering up to 450,000 Jews.</p>
<p>Also, some 150,000 Polish civilians were killed by Soviet Communists between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Union's occupation of eastern Poland (<a href="/wiki/Kresy" title="Kresy">Kresy</a>), and another estimated 100,000 Poles were killed by the <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army" title="Ukrainian Insurgent Army">Ukrainian Insurgent Army</a> (UPA) in the regions of <a href="/wiki/Volhynia" title="Volhynia">Wołyń</a> and <a href="/wiki/Galicia_(Eastern_Europe)" title="Galicia (Eastern Europe)">Eastern Galicia</a> between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia" title="Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia">Wołyń Massacres</a>. The massacres were part of a vicious <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethnic_clensing" title="Ethnic clensing">ethnic clensing</a> campaign waged by Ukrainian nationalists against the local Polish population in the German-occupied territories of eastern Poland.</p>
<p>At the war's conclusion in 1945, Poland's borders <a href="/wiki/Territorial_changes_of_Poland_immediately_after_World_War_II" title="Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II">were shifted westwards</a>, resulting in considerable territorial losses. Most of the Polish inhabitants of <a href="/wiki/Kresy" title="Kresy">Kresy</a> <a href="/wiki/Polish_population_transfers_(1944%E2%80%9346)" title="Polish population transfers (1944–46)">were expelled</a> along the <a href="/wiki/Curzon_Line" title="Curzon Line">Curzon Line</a> in accordance with Stalin's agreements. The western border was moved to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oder-Neisse_line" title="Oder-Neisse line">Oder-Neisse line</a>. As a result, Poland's territory was reduced by 20%, or 77,500 square kilometres (29,900 sq mi). The shift forced the migration of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II_evacuation_and_expulsion" title="World War II evacuation and expulsion">millions of other people</a>, most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews. <a href="/wiki/World_War_II_casualties" title="World War II casualties">Of all the countries involved</a> in the war, Poland <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Occupation_of_Poland_(1939%E2%80%931945)" title="Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)">lost the highest percentage of its citizens</a>: over 6 million perished – nearly one-fifth of Poland's population – <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holocaust_in_Poland" title="Holocaust in Poland">half of them</a> Polish Jews.

<p>At the insistence of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Yalta_Conference" title="Yalta Conference">Yalta Conference</a> sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" title="Polish government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> based in London; a move which angered many Poles who considered it a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yalta_betrayal" title="Yalta betrayal">betrayal</a> by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" title="Winston Churchill">Churchill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of 'legitimacy' for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new <a href="/wiki/Communist_state" title="Communist state">communist</a> government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-Communism_in_the_Communist_Bloc" title="Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc">As elsewhere in Communist Europe</a> the Soviet occupation of Poland met with <a href="/wiki/Cursed_soldiers" title="Cursed soldiers">armed resistance</a> from the outset which continued into the fifties.</p>
<p>Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland (in particular the cities of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wilno" title="Wilno">Wilno</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w" title="Lwów">Lwów</a>) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Pact" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> throughout the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture and in the European scene came to characterise the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland" title="People's Republic of Poland">People's Republic of Poland</a> (<i>Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa</i>) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_Poland" title="Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland">was officially proclaimed in 1952</a>. In 1956 after the death of <a href="/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_Bierut" title="Bolesław Bierut">Bolesław Bierut</a>, the régime of <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Gomu%C5%82ka" title="Władysław Gomułka">Władysław Gomułka</a> became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. <a href="/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Polish_People%27s_Republic" title="Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic">Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic</a> failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under <a href="/wiki/Edward_Gierek" title="Edward Gierek">Edward Gierek</a>, but most of the time persecution of <a href="/wiki/Anti-communist_resistance_in_Poland" title="Anti-communist resistance in Poland">anti-communist opposition</a> groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soviet_Bloc" title="Soviet Bloc">Soviet Bloc</a>.</p>
<p>Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union "<a href="/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)" title="Solidarity (Polish trade union)">Solidarity</a>" ("<i>Solidarność</i>"), which over time became a political force.

As with other post-communist countries, Poland suffered slumps in social and economic standards, but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 GDP levels, which it achieved by 1995 largely thanks to its booming economy.</p>
<p>Most visibly, there were numerous improvements in human rights, such as <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_censorship_by_country" title="Internet censorship by country">internet freedom</a> (no censorship), civil liberties (1st class) and political rights (1st class), as ranked by <a href="/wiki/Freedom_House" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a> non-governmental organization.

In contrast to this, a section of Poland's eastern border now comprises the external EU border with <a href="/wiki/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, Russia and Ukraine.

The Vistula and the Oder flow into the Baltic Sea, as do numerous smaller rivers in Pomerania.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/%C5%81yna_River" title="Łyna River">Łyna</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Angrapa_River" title="Angrapa River">Angrapa</a> flow by way of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pregolya" title="Pregolya">Pregolya</a> to the Baltic, and the <a href="/wiki/Czarna_Ha%C5%84cza" title="Czarna Hańcza">Czarna Hańcza</a> flows into the Baltic through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neman_River" title="Neman River">Neman</a>. While the great majority of Poland's rivers drain into the Baltic Sea, Poland's Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orava_River" title="Orava River">Orava</a>, which flows via the <a href="/wiki/V%C3%A1h" title="Váh">Váh</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the <a href="/wiki/Dniester" title="Dniester">Dniester</a> to the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Poland's rivers have been used since early times for navigation. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viking" title="Viking">Vikings</a>, for example, traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their <a href="/wiki/Longship" title="Longship">longships</a>. In the Middle Ages and in early modern times, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was the breadbasket of Europe; the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a> and onward to other parts of Europe took on great importance.</p>

<p>In the valley of <a href="/wiki/Pilica_(river)" title="Pilica (river)">Pilica</a> river in <a href="/wiki/Tomasz%C3%B3w_Mazowiecki" title="Tomaszów Mazowiecki">Tomaszów Mazowiecki</a> there is a unique natural <a href="/wiki/Spring_(hydrology)" title="Spring (hydrology)">karst spring</a> of water containing calcium salts, that is an object of protection in <a href="/wiki/Niebieskie_%C5%B9r%C3%B3d%C5%82a_Nature_Reserve" title="Niebieskie Źródła Nature Reserve">Niebieskie Źródła Nature Reserve</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sulej%C3%B3w_Landscape_Park" title="Sulejów Landscape Park">Sulejów Landscape Park</a>. The origin of the name of the reserve <i>Niebieskie Źródła</i>, that means <i>Blue Springs</i>, comes from the fact that red waves are absorbed by water and only blue and green are reflected from the bottom of the spring, giving that atypical colour.</p>
<p>With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than 1 hectare (2.47 acres) each, Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world. In Europe, only <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> has a greater density of lakes. The largest lakes, covering more than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi), are <a href="/wiki/%C5%9Aniardwy" title="Śniardwy">Lake Śniardwy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lake_Mamry" title="Lake Mamry">Lake Mamry</a> in <a href="/wiki/Masuria" title="Masuria">Masuria</a>, and <a href="/wiki/%C5%81ebsko_Lake" title="Łebsko Lake">Lake Łebsko</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drawsko_Lake" title="Drawsko Lake">Lake Drawsko</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pomerania" title="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the lake districts in the north (in Masuria, Pomerania, <a href="/wiki/Kashubians" title="Kashubians">Kashubia</a>, Lubuskie, and <a href="/wiki/Greater_Poland" title="Greater Poland">Greater Poland</a>), there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras, of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area. The lake with the greatest depth—of more than 100 metres (328 ft)—is <a href="/wiki/Ha%C5%84cza" title="Hańcza">Lake Hańcza</a> in the Wigry Lake District, east of Masuria in <a href="/wiki/Podlaskie_Voivodeship" title="Podlaskie Voivodeship">Podlaskie Voivodeship</a>.</p>

<p>Among the first lakes whose shores were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District. The <a href="/wiki/Stilt_house" title="Stilt house">stilt house</a> settlement of <a href="/wiki/Biskupin" title="Biskupin">Biskupin</a>, occupied by more than one thousand residents, was founded before the 7th century BC by people of the <a href="/wiki/Lusatian_culture" title="Lusatian culture">Lusatian culture</a>.</p>
<p>Lakes have always played an important role in Polish history and continue to be of great importance to today's modern Polish society. The ancestors of today's Poles, the <a href="/wiki/Polans_(western)" title="Polans (western)">Polanie</a>, built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes. The legendary Prince <a href="/wiki/Popiel" title="Popiel">Popiel</a> ruled from <a href="/wiki/Kruszwica" title="Kruszwica">Kruszwica</a> tower erected on the <a href="/wiki/Gop%C5%82o" title="Gopło">Lake Gopło</a>. The first historically documented ruler of Poland, Duke <a href="/wiki/Mieszko_I_of_Poland" title="Mieszko I of Poland">Mieszko I</a>, had his palace on an island in the Warta River in <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84" title="Poznań">Poznań</a>.

<p>The Polish Baltic coast is approximately 528 kilometres (328 mi) long and extends from <a href="/wiki/%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie" title="Świnoujście">Świnoujście</a> on the islands of <a href="/wiki/Usedom" title="Usedom">Usedom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wolin" title="Wolin">Wolin</a> in the west to <a href="/wiki/Krynica_Morska" title="Krynica Morska">Krynica Morska</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Vistula_Spit" title="Vistula Spit">Vistula Spit</a> in the east. For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds. This continual <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deposition_(geology)" title="Deposition (geology)">deposition</a> has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons, such as Łebsko Lake in Słowiński National Park.</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> and subsequent <a href="/wiki/Territorial_changes_of_Poland_immediately_after_World_War_II" title="Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II">change in national borders</a>, Poland had only a very small coastline; this was situated at the end of the '<a href="/wiki/Polish_Corridor" title="Polish Corridor">Polish Corridor</a>', the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea. However, after World War II, the redrawing of Poland's borders and resulting 'shift' of the country's borders left it with an expanded coastline, thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible. The significance of this event, and importance of it to Poland's future as a major industrialised nation, was alluded to by the 1945 <a href="/wiki/Poland%27s_Wedding_to_the_Sea" title="Poland's Wedding to the Sea">Wedding to the Sea</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Poland" title="Constitution of Poland">Constitution of Poland</a> is the supreme law in contemporary Poland, and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of Civil Law. Historically, the most famous Polish legal act is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Constitution_of_3_May_1791" title="Constitution of 3 May 1791">Constitution of 3 May 1791</a>. Historian <a href="/wiki/Norman_Davies" title="Norman Davies">Norman Davies</a> describes it as the first of its kind in Europe. The Constitution was instituted as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government_Act" title="Government Act">Government Act</a> (<a href="/wiki/Polish_language" title="Polish language">Polish</a>: <span lang="pl"><i>Ustawa rządowa</i></span>) and then adopted on 3 May 1791 by the <a href="/wiki/Sejm" title="Sejm">Sejm</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. Primarily, it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">federative</a> Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its <a href="/wiki/Golden_Liberty" title="Golden Liberty">Golden Liberty</a>. Previously only the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Henrican_articles" title="Henrican articles">Henrican articles</a> signed by each of Poland's elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws.</p>

<p>The new Constitution introduced political equality between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Townspeople" title="Townspeople">townspeople</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Nobility" title="Nobility">nobility</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Szlachta" title="Szlachta">szlachta</a></i>), and placed the <a href="/wiki/Peasant" title="Peasant">peasants</a> under the protection of the government. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Liberum_veto" title="Liberum veto">liberum veto</a></i>, which at one time had placed the <a href="/wiki/Sejm" title="Sejm">sejm</a> at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be <a href="/wiki/Bribery" title="Bribery">bribed</a> by an interest or foreign power, to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's <a href="/wiki/Reactionary" title="Reactionary">reactionary</a> <a href="/wiki/Magnate" title="Magnate">magnates</a>, with a more <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> and democratic <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. The adoption of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_3_May_1791" title="wikisource:Constitution of 3 May 1791">the constitution</a> was treated as a threat by Poland's neighbours. In response <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a> and Russia formed an anti-Polish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" title="Partitions of Poland">partition</a> their weaker neighbour and destroyed the Polish state. In the words of two of its co-authors, <a href="/wiki/Ignacy_Potocki" title="Ignacy Potocki">Ignacy Potocki</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Ko%C5%82%C5%82%C4%85taj" title="Hugo Kołłątaj">Hugo Kołłątaj</a>, the constitution represented "the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland." Despite this, its text influenced many later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Democratic_movement" title="Democratic movement">democratic movements</a> across the globe. In Poland, freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Article 25 (section I. The Republic) and Article 54 (section II. The Freedoms, Rights and Obligations of Persons and Citizens) of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Poland" title="Constitution of Poland">Constitution of Poland</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Feminism_in_Poland" title="Feminism in Poland">Feminism in Poland</a> started in the 1800s in the age of the foreign Partitions. Poland's precursor of feminism, <a href="/wiki/Narcyza_%C5%BBmichowska" title="Narcyza Żmichowska">Narcyza Żmichowska</a>, founded a group of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Suffragettes" title="Suffragettes">Suffragettes</a> in 1842. Prior to the <a href="/wiki/Third_Partition_of_Poland" title="Third Partition of Poland">last Partition</a> in 1795, tax-paying females were allowed to take part in political life. Since 1918, following the return to independence, all women could vote. Poland was the 15th (12th sovereign) country to introduce universal women's suffrage. Currently, in Poland <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a> is allowed only in special circumstances, such as when the woman's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy, when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act, or when the fetus is seriously malformed. Homosexuality in Poland was confirmed as legal in 1932. Poland recognises gender change.</p>

<p>A 2010 article in <i><a href="/wiki/Rzeczpospolita_(newspaper)" title="Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)">Rzeczpospolita</a></i> reported that in a 2008 study three-quarters of Poles were against gay marriage and the adoption of children by gay couples. The same study revealed that 66% of respondents were opposed to <a href="/wiki/Pride_parade" title="Pride parade">Pride parade</a> as the demonstration of a way of life, and 69% believed that gay people should not show their sexual orientation in public.

<p>Poland's current constitution was adopted by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Poland" title="National Assembly of Poland">National Assembly of Poland</a> on 2 April 1997, approved by a national <a href="/wiki/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendum</a> on 25 May 1997, and came into effect on 17 October 1997.

<p>In recent years, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other European nations and a large number of 'developing' countries.</p>

In 1996, Poland achieved full <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> membership, and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a> (NATO) in the first wave of <a href="/wiki/Enlargement_of_NATO" title="Enlargement of NATO">policy enlargement</a> finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999.</p>

<p>As changes since the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of Europe, Poland has tried to forge strong and mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours, this has notably included signing 'friendship treaties' to replace links severed by the collapse of the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Pact" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>. Poland has forged a special relationships with <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, with whom it co-hosted the UEFA <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Euro_2012" title="Euro 2012">Euro 2012</a> football tournament, in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the Western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_Federation" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a>. Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Former_Soviet_Union" title="Former Soviet Union">former Soviet Union</a>; this is particularly true of <a href="/wiki/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, where in 2005 the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lukashenko" title="Lukashenko">Lukashenko</a> regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Poland" title="Administrative divisions of Poland">Administrative divisions of Poland</a></div>
<p>Poland's current <a href="/wiki/Voivodeships_of_Poland" title="Voivodeships of Poland">voivodeships</a> (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) for Opole Voivodeship to more than 35,000 square kilometres (14,000 sq mi) for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed <a href="/wiki/Voivode" title="Voivode">voivode</a> (governor), an elected regional assembly (<i><a href="/wiki/Voivodeship_sejmik" title="Voivodeship sejmik">sejmik</a></i>) and an executive elected by that assembly.</p>
<p>The voivodeships are subdivided into <i><a href="/wiki/Powiat" title="Powiat">powiats</a></i> (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into <i><a href="/wiki/Gmina" title="Gmina">gminas</a></i> (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both <i>gmina</i> and <i>powiat</i>. Poland has 16 voivodeships, 379 powiats (including 65 cities with <i>powiat</i> status), and 2,478 <i>gminas</i>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces" title="Polish Armed Forces">Polish Armed Forces</a></div>

<p>The Polish armed forces are composed of four branches: <a href="/wiki/Polish_Land_Forces" title="Polish Land Forces">Land Forces</a> (<i>Wojska Lądowe</i>), <a href="/wiki/Polish_Navy" title="Polish Navy">Navy</a> (<i>Marynarka Wojenna</i>), <a href="/wiki/Polish_Air_Force" title="Polish Air Force">Air Force</a> (<i>Siły Powietrzne</i>) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Special_forces_of_Poland" title="Special forces of Poland">Special Forces</a> (<i>Wojska Specjalne</i>). The military is subordinate to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Defence_of_the_Republic_of_Poland" title="Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland">Minister for National Defence</a>. However, its sole commander-in-chief is the President of the Republic.</p>
<p>The Polish army consists of 65,000 active personnel, whilst the navy and air force respectively employ 14,300 and 26,126 servicemen and women. The Polish Navy primarily operates in the Baltic Sea and conducts operations such as maritime patrol, search and rescue for the section of the Baltic under Polish sovereignty, as well as hydrographic measurements and research. Also, the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, providing logistical support for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a>. The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Air_Policing" title="Baltic Air Policing">Baltic Air Policing</a> assignments, but otherwise, with the exception of a number of units serving in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, has seen no active combat since the end of the Second World War. In 2003, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-16_Fighting_Falcon" title="F-16 Fighting Falcon">F-16C</a> Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006.</p>

<p>The most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad. Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military. The armed forces are being re-organised according to NATO standards, and since 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed. During the previous period, men were obliged to undertake compulsory military service. In the final stage of validity of this type of military service (since 2007 until the amendment of the law on conscription in 2008) the duration of compulsory service amounted nine months.</p>

<p>Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners. From 1953 to 2009 Poland was a large contributor to various United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Polish Armed Forces took part in the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, deploying 2,500 soldiers in the south of that country and commanding the 17-nation <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq" title="Multinational force in Iraq">Multinational force in Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>The military was temporarily, but severely, affected by the loss of many of its top commanders in the wake the <a href="/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash" title="2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash">2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash</a> near Smolensk, Russia, which killed all 96 passengers and crew, including, among others, the Chief of the Polish Army's General Staff <a href="/wiki/Franciszek_G%C4%85gor" title="Franciszek Gągor">Franciszek Gągor</a> and Polish Air Force commanding general <a href="/wiki/Andrzej_B%C5%82asik" title="Andrzej Błasik">Andrzej Błasik</a>.

<p>Poland has a highly developed system of law enforcement with a long history of effective policing by the <a href="/wiki/Policja" title="Policja">State Police Service</a>. The structure of law enforcement agencies within Poland is a multi-tier one, with the State Police providing criminal-investigative services, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Municipal_Police" title="Municipal Police">Municipal Police</a> serving to maintain public order and a number of other specialised agencies, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polish_Border_Guard" title="Polish Border Guard">Polish Border Guard</a>, acting to fulfil their assigned missions. In addition to these state services, private security companies are also common, although they possess no powers assigned to state agencies, such as, for example, the power to make an arrest or detain a suspect.</p>
<p>Emergency services in Poland consist of the <a href="/wiki/Emergency_medical_services_in_Poland" title="Emergency medical services in Poland">emergency medical services</a>, <a href="/wiki/Search_and_rescue#Poland" title="Search and rescue">search and rescue</a> units of the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces" title="Polish Armed Forces">Polish Armed Forces</a> and <a href="/wiki/State_Fire_Service" title="State Fire Service">State Fire Service</a>.

<p>Since joining the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> all of Poland's emergency services have been undergoing major restructuring and have, in the process, acquired large amounts of new equipment and staff. All emergency services personnel are now uniformed and can be easily recognised thanks to a number of innovative design features, such as reflective paint and printing, present throughout their service dress and vehicle liveries. In addition to this, in an effort to comply with EU standards and safety regulations, the police and other agencies have been steadily replacing and modernising their fleets of vehicles; this has left them with thousands of new automobiles, as well as many new aircraft, boats and helicopters.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Poland" title="Economy of Poland">Economy of Poland</a></div>

<p>Poland's high-income economy is considered to be one of the largest of the post-Communist countries and is one of the fastest growing within the EU. Having a strong domestic market, low private debt, flexible currency, and not being dependent on a single export sector, Poland is the only European economy to have avoided the <a href="/wiki/Great_Recession" title="Great Recession">late-2000s recession</a>. Since the <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989" title="Revolutions of 1989">fall of the communist government</a>, Poland has pursued a policy <a href="/wiki/Neoliberalism" title="Neoliberalism">of liberalising</a> the economy. It is an example of the transition from a <a href="/wiki/Planned_economy" title="Planned economy">centrally planned</a> to a primarily <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market-based economy</a>. The country's most successful exports include machinery, furniture, food products, clothing, shoes and cosmetics. Poland's largest trading partner is Germany.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Privatization" title="Privatization">privatization</a> of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms have allowed the development of the private sector. Also, several <a href="/wiki/Consumer_protection" title="Consumer protection">consumer rights</a> organizations have become active in the country. Restructuring and privatisation of "sensitive sectors" such as coal, steel, rail transport and energy has been continuing since 1990. The biggest privatisations have been the sale of the national <a href="/wiki/Telecommunication" title="Telecommunication">telecoms</a> firm <a href="/wiki/Orange_Polska" title="Orange Polska">Telekomunikacja Polska</a> to <a href="/wiki/Orange_S.A." title="Orange S.A.">France Télécom</a> in 2000, and an issue of 30% of the shares in Poland's largest bank, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PKO_Bank_Polski" title="PKO Bank Polski">PKO Bank Polski</a>, on the Polish stockmarket in 2004.</p>
<p>The Polish banking sector is the largest in East Central/Eastern European region, with 32.3 branches per 100,000 adults. The banks are the largest and most developed sector of the country's <a href="/wiki/Financial_market" title="Financial market">financial markets</a>. They are regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Financial_Supervision_Authority_(Poland)" title="Financial Supervision Authority (Poland)">Polish Financial Supervision Authority</a>. During the transformation to a market-oriented economy, the government privatized several banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector more competitive. This has attracted a significant number of strategic foreign investors (ICFI). Poland's banking sector has approximately 5 national banks, a network of nearly 600 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned banks. In addition, foreign investors have controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which make up 68% of the banking capital.</p>

<p>Poland has a large number of private farms in its agricultural sector, with the potential to become a leading producer of food in the European Union. The biggest money-makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish, fine chocolate, and dairy products, meats and specialty breads, with the exchange rate conducive to export growth. Food exports amounted to 62 billion <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zloty" title="Zloty">zloty</a> in 2011, increasing by 17% from 2010. Structural reforms in health care, education, the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger-than-expected fiscal pressures. Warsaw leads Central Europe in foreign investment. GDP growth had been strong and steady from 1993 to 2000 with only a short slowdown from 2001 to 2002, also the country avoided recession in 2008.</p>
<p>The economy had growth of 3.7% annually in 2003, a rise from 1.4% annually in 2002. In 2004, GDP growth equaled 5.4%, in 2005 3.3% and in 2006 6.2%. According to <a href="/wiki/Eurostat" title="Eurostat">Eurostat</a> data, Polish PPS GDP per capita stood at 67% of the EU average in 2012.</p>
<p>Average salaries in the enterprise sector in December 2010 were 3,848 PLN (1,012 euro or 1,374 US dollars) and growing sharply. Salaries vary between the regions: the <a href="/wiki/Median" title="Median">median</a> wage in the capital city Warsaw was 4,603 PLN (1,177 euro or 1,680 US dollars) while in <a href="/wiki/Kielce" title="Kielce">Kielce</a> it was 3,083 PLN (788 euro or 1125 US dollars). There is a wide distribution of salaries among the various districts of Poland.

<p>According to a <a href="/wiki/Credit_Suisse" title="Credit Suisse">Credit Suisse</a> report, Poles are the second wealthiest (after <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czechs</a>) of the Central European peoples.</p>

<p>The electricity generation sector in Poland is largely <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil-fuel</a>–based. Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy. In 2013, Poland scored 48 out of 129 states in the Energy Sustainability Index. The three largest Polish coal mining firms (<a href="/wiki/W%C4%99glokoks" title="Węglokoks">Węglokoks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kompania_W%C4%99glowa" title="Kompania Węglowa">Kompania Węglowa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jastrz%C4%99bska_Sp%C3%B3%C5%82ka_W%C4%99glowa" title="Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa">JSW</a>) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually. All three of these companies are key constituents of the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Stock_Exchange" title="Warsaw Stock Exchange">Warsaw Stock Exchange</a>'s lead economic indexes.</p>
<p>Renewable forms of energy account for a small proportion of Poland's full energy generation capacity. However, the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland which should see the portion of power produced by renewable resources climb to 7.5% by 2010 and 15% by 2020. This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of <a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">wind farms</a> and a number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> stations.</p>
<p>Poland is thought to have around 164,800,000,000 m of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as <a href="/wiki/PKN_Orlen" title="PKN Orlen">PKN Orlen</a> ("the only Polish company listed in the <a href="/wiki/Fortune_Global_500" title="Fortune Global 500">Fortune Global 500</a>"). However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.</p>

<p>Since joining the EU in May 2004, Poland has invested large amounts of public funds into modernization projects of its transport networks. The country now has a developing expressway network composed of motorways such as the <a href="/wiki/A1_autostrada_(Poland)" title="A1 autostrada (Poland)">A1</a>, <a href="/wiki/A2_autostrada_(Poland)" title="A2 autostrada (Poland)">A2</a>, <a href="/wiki/A4_autostrada_(Poland)" title="A4 autostrada (Poland)">A4</a>, <a href="/wiki/A8_autostrada_(Poland)" title="A8 autostrada (Poland)">A8</a>, <a href="/wiki/A18_autostrada_(Poland)" title="A18 autostrada (Poland)">A18</a> and express roads such as the <a href="/wiki/Expressway_S1_(Poland)" title="Expressway S1 (Poland)">S1</a>, <a href="/wiki/Expressway_S3_(Poland)" title="Expressway S3 (Poland)">S3</a>, <a href="/wiki/Expressway_S5_(Poland)" title="Expressway S5 (Poland)">S5</a>, <a href="/wiki/Expressway_S7_(Poland)" title="Expressway S7 (Poland)">S7</a>, <a href="/wiki/Expressway_S8_(Poland)" title="Expressway S8 (Poland)">S8</a>.

<p>In 2015, the nation had 11,800 miles (19,000 km) of railway track. Trains can operate up to 99 miles per hour (159 km/h) on 7.5% of the track. Most trains operate between 50 and 75 miles per hour (80 and 121 km/h). Part of the system operates at 25 miles per hour (40 km/h). Polish authorities maintain a program of improving operating speeds across the entire Polish rail network. Polish State Railways (PKP) are using new rolling stock such as Siemens Taurus ES64U4, which is in principle capable of speeds up to 200 km/h (124 mph). In December 2014, Poland began to implement <a href="/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_Poland" title="High-speed rail in Poland">high–speed rail routes</a> connecting major Polish cities. The Polish government has revealed that it intends to connect all major cities to a future high-speed rail network by 2020. The new PKP Pendolino ETR 610 test train set the record for the fastest train in the history of Poland, reaching 293 km/h (182 mph) on 24 November 2013. Previously, the speed record had been 160 km/h (99 mph) since 1985.

<p>In recent years, Poland's population has decreased due to an increase in emigration and a decline in the birth rate. Since Poland's accession to the European Union, a significant number of Poles <a href="/wiki/Migrations_from_Poland_since_EU_accession" title="Migrations from Poland since EU accession">have emigrated</a>, primarily to the <a href="/wiki/Poles_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Poles in the United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poles_in_Germany" title="Poles in Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polish_minority_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland" title="Polish minority in the Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> in search of better work opportunities abroad. With better economic conditions and Polish salaries at 70% of the EU average in 2016, this trend started to decrease in the 2010s and workforce became needed in the country. As a result, the Polish Minister of Development <a href="/wiki/Mateusz_Morawiecki" title="Mateusz Morawiecki">Mateusz Morawiecki</a> suggested that Poles abroad should return to Poland.</p>
<p>Polish minorities are still present in the neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries (see <a href="/wiki/Poles" title="Poles">Poles</a> for population numbers). Altogether, the number of ethnic Poles living abroad is estimated to be around 20 million.

<p>From its beginnings, Poland has contributed substantially to the development of religious freedom. Since the country adopted Christianity in 966, it was also welcoming to other religions through a series of laws: <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Kalisz" title="Statute of Kalisz">Statute of Kalisz</a> (1264), <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Confederation" title="Warsaw Confederation">Warsaw Confederation</a> (1573). The Polish king <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o" title="Władysław II Jagiełło">Władysław II Jagiełło</a>, however, was pressed by the Catholic Church to issue the <a href="/wiki/Edict_of_Wielu%C5%84" title="Edict of Wieluń">Edict of Wieluń</a> (1424), outlawing early Protestant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hussite" title="Hussite">Hussitism</a>. Polish theological thought includes movements such as Calvinist <a href="/wiki/Polish_Brethren" title="Polish Brethren">Polish Brethren</a> and a number of other Protestant groups, as well as atheists, such as ex-Jesuit philosopher <a href="/wiki/Kazimierz_%C5%81yszczy%C5%84ski" title="Kazimierz Łyszczyński">Kazimierz Łyszczyński</a>, one of the first atheist thinkers in Europe. Also, in the 16th century, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anabaptist" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptists</a> from the Netherlands and Germany settled in Poland—after being persecuted in Western Europe—and became known as the <a href="/wiki/Vistula_delta_Mennonites" title="Vistula delta Mennonites">Vistula delta Mennonites</a>.</p>
<p>Until <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> Poland was a religiously diverse society, in which substantial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Christian Orthodox</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>, <a href="/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church" title="Armenian Apostolic Church">Armenian Christian</a> and Roman Catholic groups coexisted. In the Second Polish Republic, Roman Catholic was the dominant religion, declared by about 65% of the Polish citizens, followed by other Christian denominations, and about 3% of Judaism believers. As a result of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> and the post–World War II <a href="/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_from_Poland_during_and_after_World_War_II" title="Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II">flight and expulsion of German</a> and <a href="/wiki/Operation_Vistula" title="Operation Vistula">Ukrainian</a> populations, Poland has become overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. In 2007, 88.4% of the population belonged to the Catholic Church. Though rates of religious observance are lower, at 52% or 51% of the Polish Catholics, Poland remains one of the most devoutly religious countries in Europe.</p>

<p>Poland's healthcare system is based on an all-inclusive insurance system. State subsidised healthcare is available to all Polish citizens who are covered by this general health insurance program. However, it is not compulsory to be treated in a state-run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide.</p>
<p>All medical service providers and hospitals in Poland are subordinate to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_Republic_of_Poland" title="Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland">Polish Ministry of Health</a>, which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day-to-day administration of the healthcare system. In addition to these roles, the ministry is also tasked with the maintenance of standards of hygiene and patient-care.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Poland are organised according to the regional administrative structure, resultantly most towns have their own hospital <i>(Szpital Miejski)</i>. Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in larger cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. However, all <a href="/wiki/Voivodeship" title="Voivodeship">voivodeships</a> have their own general hospital (most have more than one), all of which are obliged to have a trauma centre; these types of hospital, which are able to deal with almost all medical problems are called 'regional hospitals' <i>(Szpital Wojewódzki)</i>. The last category of hospital in Poland is that of specialised medical centres, an example of which would be the <a href="/wiki/Curie_Institute,_Warsaw" title="Curie Institute, Warsaw">Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology</a>, Poland's leading, and most highly specialised centre for the research and treatment of cancer.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Polish health-care industry experienced a transformation. Hospitals were given priority for refurbishment where necessary. As a result of this process, many hospitals were updated with the latest medical equipment.</p>
<p>In 2013, the average <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> at birth was 76.45 years (72.53 years infant male/80.62 years infant female).</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Commission_of_National_Education" title="Commission of National Education">Commission of National Education</a> (<i>Komisja Edukacji Narodowej</i>) established in 1773, was the world's first state ministry of education. The education of Polish society was a goal of the nation's rulers as early as the 12th century. The library catalogue of the <a href="/wiki/Cathedral_chapter" title="Cathedral chapter">Cathedral Chapter</a> of Kraków dating back to 1110 shows that in the early 12th-century Polish academia had access to European and Classical literature. The <a href="/wiki/Jagiellonian_University" title="Jagiellonian University">Jagiellonian University</a> was founded in 1364 by <a href="/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great" title="Casimir III the Great">King Casimir III</a> in Kraków—the school is <a href="/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation" title="List of oldest universities in continuous operation">the world's 19th oldest university</a>.</p>

<p>Education in Poland starts at the age of five or six (with the particular age chosen by the parents) for the '0' class (Kindergarten) and six or seven years in the 1st class of primary school (<a href="/wiki/Polish_language" title="Polish language">Polish</a> <i>szkoła podstawowa</i>). It is compulsory that children participate in one year of formal education before entering the 1st class at no later than 7 years of age. <a href="/wiki/Corporal_punishment" title="Corporal punishment">Corporal punishment</a> of children in <a href="/wiki/School_corporal_punishment" title="School corporal punishment">schools</a> is officially prohibited since 1783 (before the partitions) and criminalised since 2010 (in schools as well as at home).</p>
<p>At the end of the 6th class when students are 13, students take a compulsory exam that will determine their acceptance and transition into a specific lower secondary school (<i>gimnazjum, pronounced gheem-nah-sium</i>) (Middle School/Junior High). They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a <i>liceum</i> or four years in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Technikum" title="Technikum">technikum</a>. Both end with a maturity examination (<a href="/wiki/Matura" title="Matura">matura</a>—similar to French <a href="/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at" title="Baccalauréat">baccalauréat</a>), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Licencjat" title="Licencjat">licencjat</a> or inżynier (the Polish <a href="/wiki/Bologna_Process" title="Bologna Process">Bologna Process</a> first cycle qualification), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magister_(degree)" title="Magister (degree)">magister</a> (second cycle qualification) and eventually <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Doktor" title="Doktor">doktor</a> (third cycle qualification).</p>
<p>In Poland, there are 500 university-level institutions for the pursuit of higher education. There are 18 fully accredited traditional universities, 20 technical universities, 9 independent medical universities, 5 universities for the study of economics, 9 agricultural academies, 3 pedagogical universities, a theological academy, 3 maritime service universities and 4 national military academies. Also, there are a number of higher educational institutions dedicated to the teaching of the arts—amongst these are the 7 academies of music.</p>

<p>The culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1,000-year <a href="/wiki/History_of_Poland" title="History of Poland">history</a> Its unique character developed as a result of its geography at the confluence of European cultures. With origins in the culture of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proto-Slavs" title="Proto-Slavs">Proto-Slavs</a>, over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the <a href="/wiki/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latinate" title="Latinate">Latinate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland. The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries. In the 19th and 20th centuries the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity. These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.</p>

<p>Poland has a long-standing tradition of tolerance towards minorities, as well as an absence of discrimination on the grounds of religion, nationality or race. Prior to World War II, ethnic minorities made up a significant proportion of the Polish population. Poland has maintained a high level of <a href="/wiki/Gender_equality" title="Gender equality">gender equality</a>, an established <a href="/wiki/Disability_rights_movement" title="Disability rights movement">disability rights movement</a> and promotes peaceful equality.</p>

<p>Poland was the first country in the world to prohibit <a href="/wiki/Corporal_punishment" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a> in all its forms. Poland has, throughout most of its long history, experienced only very limited immigration from abroad; this trend can be largely attributed to Poland's rejection of slavery and to a lack of overseas colonies as well as occupation of its territories during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite this, the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society, which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background. This can be said to stem largely from the reign of King <a href="/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great" title="Casimir III the Great">Casimir III the Great</a> and his acceptance of Poland's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish_community" title="Jewish community">Jewish community</a>, in a time when most of Europe recessed into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antisemitic" title="Antisemitic">antisemitic</a> moods and actions.

The population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world as a result of the radically altered borders after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the subsequent migrations. This homogeneity is a result of post World War II deportations ordered by the Soviet authorities, who wished to remove the sizeable Polish minorities from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Repatriation_of_Ukrainians_from_Poland_to_the_Soviet_Union" title="Repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union">repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union</a> (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Territorial_changes_of_Poland" title="Territorial changes of Poland">territorial changes of Poland</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Historical_demography_of_Poland" title="Historical demography of Poland">historical demography of Poland</a> for details).

<p>The origins of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in <a href="/wiki/Stary_S%C4%85cz" title="Stary Sącz">Stary Sącz</a>, containing <a href="/wiki/Polyphony" title="Polyphony">polyphonic</a> compositions related to the Parisian <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Notre_Dame_School" title="Notre Dame School">Notre Dame School</a>. Other early compositions, such as the melody of <i><a href="/wiki/Bogurodzica" title="Bogurodzica">Bogurodzica</a></i> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/B%C3%B3g_si%C4%99_rodzi" title="Bóg się rodzi">Bóg się rodzi</a></i> (a coronation polonaise for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, <a href="/wiki/Miko%C5%82aj_z_Radomia" title="Mikołaj z Radomia">Mikołaj z Radomia</a>, was born and lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups – both based in <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a> and belonging to the King and Archbishop of Wawel – led to the rapid development of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wac%C5%82aw_z_Szamotu%C5%82" title="Wacław z Szamotuł">Wacław z Szamotuł</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miko%C5%82aj_Ziele%C5%84ski" title="Mikołaj Zieleński">Mikołaj Zieleński</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Miko%C5%82aj_Gom%C3%B3%C5%82ka" title="Mikołaj Gomółka">Mikołaj Gomółka</a>. <a href="/wiki/Diomedes_Cato" title="Diomedes Cato">Diomedes Cato</a>, a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków from about the age of five, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.</p>

<p>At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the <a href="/wiki/Polonaise" title="Polonaise">polonaise</a>. In the 19th century the most popular composers were: <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Elsner" title="Józef Elsner">Józef Elsner</a> and his pupils <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fryderyk_Chopin" title="Fryderyk Chopin">Fryderyk Chopin</a> and Ignacy Dobrzyński.

At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most prominent composers could said to have been <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_%C5%BBele%C5%84ski_(musician)" title="Władysław Żeleński (musician)">Władysław Zeleński</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mieczys%C5%82aw_Kar%C5%82owicz" title="Mieczysław Karłowicz">Mieczysław Karłowicz</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Karol_Szymanowski" title="Karol Szymanowski">Karol Szymanowski</a> gaining prominence prior to World War II. <a href="/wiki/Alexandre_Tansman" title="Alexandre Tansman">Alexandre Tansman</a> lived in Paris but had strong connections with Poland. <a href="/wiki/Witold_Lutos%C5%82awski" title="Witold Lutosławski">Witold Lutosławski</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henryk_G%C3%B3recki" title="Henryk Górecki">Henryk Górecki</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Krzysztof_Penderecki" title="Krzysztof Penderecki">Krzysztof Penderecki</a> composed in Poland, <a href="/wiki/Andrzej_Panufnik" title="Andrzej Panufnik">Andrzej Panufnik</a> emigrated.</p>

<p>Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many well-known Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts. All of Chopin's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin" title="List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin">works</a> involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the <a href="/wiki/Musical_form" title="Musical form">musical form</a> known as the <a href="/wiki/Ballade_(classical_music)#Instrumental_ballades" title="Ballade (classical music)">instrumental ballade</a> and made major innovations to the <a href="/wiki/Piano_sonata" title="Piano sonata">piano sonata</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mazurka" title="Mazurka">mazurka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">waltz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nocturne" title="Nocturne">nocturne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polonaise" title="Polonaise">polonaise</a>, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89tude" title="Étude">étude</a>, <a href="/wiki/Impromptu" title="Impromptu">impromptu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prelude_(music)" title="Prelude (music)">prélude</a>, he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that the such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of <a href="/wiki/Zakopane" title="Zakopane">Zakopane</a>.</p>
<p>Today Poland has a very active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as <a href="/wiki/Krzysztof_Komeda" title="Krzysztof Komeda">Krzysztof Komeda</a>, created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day.

<p>Polish cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of European architectural styles. <a href="/wiki/Romanesque_architecture" title="Romanesque architecture">Romanesque architecture</a> is represented by <a href="/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Church,_Krak%C3%B3w" title="St. Andrew's Church, Kraków">St. Andrew's Church, Kraków</a>, and <a href="/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Church,_Gda%C5%84sk" title="St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk">St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk</a>, is characteristic for the <a href="/wiki/Brick_Gothic" title="Brick Gothic">Brick Gothic</a> style found in Poland.

For some time the late renaissance style known as <a href="/wiki/Mannerism" title="Mannerism">mannerism</a>, most notably in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cracow_Bishops%27_Palace_in_Kielce" title="Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce">Bishop's Palace</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kielce" title="Kielce">Kielce</a>, coexisted with the early baroque style, typified in the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kraków.</p>

<p>History has not been kind to Poland's architectural monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures has survived: castles, churches, and stately homes, often unique in the regional or European context. Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like <a href="/wiki/Wawel_Castle" title="Wawel Castle">Wawel Castle</a>, or completely reconstructed after being destroyed in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Old_Town" title="Warsaw Old Town">Old Town</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Castle_in_Warsaw" title="Royal Castle in Warsaw">Royal Castle</a> of Warsaw and the Old Town of <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>.</p>
<p>The architecture of Gdańsk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety, a Gothic style common among the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of <a href="/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw" title="Wrocław">Wrocław</a> is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the German states. The centre of <a href="/wiki/Kazimierz_Dolny" title="Kazimierz Dolny">Kazimierz Dolny</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Vistula" title="Vistula">Vistula</a> is a good example of a well-preserved medieval town. Poland's ancient capital, <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>, ranks among the best-preserved <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic</a> and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe. Meanwhile, the legacy of the <a href="/wiki/Kresy" title="Kresy">Kresy</a> Marchlands of Poland's eastern regions, where Wilno and Lwów (now <i>Vilnius</i> and <i>Lviv</i>) were recognised as two major centres for the arts, played a special role in the development of Polish architecture, with Catholic church architecture deserving special note.</p>
<p>The second half of the 17th century is marked by <a href="/wiki/Baroque" title="Baroque">baroque</a> architecture. Side towers, such as those of <a href="/wiki/Branicki_Palace,_Bia%C5%82ystok" title="Branicki Palace, Białystok">Branicki Palace</a> in Białystok, are typical for the Polish baroque. The classical <a href="/wiki/Silesian_architecture" title="Silesian architecture">Silesian baroque</a> is represented by the University in Wrocław.
