<p>The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weather_fronts" title="Weather fronts">weather fronts</a>. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convective</a> clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cumulonimbus" title="Cumulonimbus">cumulonimbus</a> (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rainbands" title="Rainbands">rainbands</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water-saturated_air">Water-saturated air</span></h3>
<p>Air contains water vapor, and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the <i>mixing ratio</i>, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as <a href="/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a>; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100% relative humidity) and forms into a <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">cloud</a> (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The <a href="/wiki/Dew_point" title="Dew point">dew point</a> is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.</p>
<p>There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adiabatic_lapse_rate#Dry_adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Adiabatic lapse rate">Adiabatic cooling</a> occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convection</a>, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (<a href="/wiki/Orographic_lift" title="Orographic lift">orographic lift</a>). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of <a href="/wiki/Thermal_radiation" title="Thermal radiation">infrared radiation</a>, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its <a href="/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature" title="Wet-bulb temperature">wet-bulb temperature</a>, or until it reaches saturation.</p>
<p>The main ways water vapor is added to the air are: wind convergence into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on <a href="/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei" title="Cloud condensation nuclei">condensation nuclei</a> such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Altostratus" title="Altostratus">altostratus</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cirrostratus" title="Cirrostratus">cirrostratus</a>. <a href="/wiki/Stratus_cloud" title="Stratus cloud">Stratus</a> is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radiation_fog" title="Radiation fog">advection fog</a> during breezy conditions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coalescence_and_fragmentation">Coalescence and fragmentation</span></h3>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coalescence_(meteorology)" title="Coalescence (meteorology)">Coalescence</a> occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets. Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing, and is also known as the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.</p>
<p>Raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 9 mm (0.0039 to 0.3543 in) mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom, like <a href="/wiki/Hamburger" title="Hamburger">hamburger</a> buns; very large ones are shaped like <a href="/wiki/Parachute" title="Parachute">parachutes</a>. Contrary to popular belief, their shape does not resemble a teardrop. The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a> in 2004 — some of them were as large as 10 mm (0.39 in). The large size is explained by condensation on large <a href="/wiki/Smoke" title="Smoke">smoke</a> particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.</p>
<p>Rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops.</p>

<p>Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.</p>

<p>Deviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions.

<p>Rain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized. The air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain the density of the air 2.7 billion years ago.</p>

<p>Stratiform (a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in <a href="/wiki/Synoptic_scale_meteorology" title="Synoptic scale meteorology">synoptic systems</a> (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of <a href="/wiki/Cold_front" title="Cold front">cold fronts</a> and near and poleward of surface <a href="/wiki/Warm_front" title="Warm front">warm fronts</a>. Similar ascent is seen around <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclones</a> outside of the <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" title="Eye (cyclone)">eyewall</a>, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mid-latitude_cyclone" title="Mid-latitude cyclone">mid-latitude cyclones</a>. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as <a href="/wiki/Ice_pellets" title="Ice pellets">ice pellets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Snow" title="Snow">snow</a>, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. <a href="/wiki/Hail" title="Hail">Hail</a> becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3,400 m (11,000 ft) above ground level.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Convection_rain" title="Convection rain">Convective rain</a>, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cumulonimbus" title="Cumulonimbus">cumulonimbus</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cumulus_congestus" title="Cumulus congestus">cumulus congestus</a>). It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the <a href="/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropics</a> appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs. <a href="/wiki/Graupel" title="Graupel">Graupel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hail" title="Hail">hail</a> indicate convection.

<p>Orographic precipitation occurs on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Windward" title="Windward">windward</a> side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Adiabatic lapse rate">adiabatic</a> cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trade_wind" title="Trade wind">trade winds</a>), a more moist <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leeward" title="Leeward">leeward</a> or downwind side.

<p>The fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms <a href="/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei" title="Cloud condensation nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a>, leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States' <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eastern_Seaboard" title="Eastern Seaboard">Eastern Seaboard</a>, the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays. The urban heat island effect warms cities 0.6 °C (1.1 °F) to 5.6 °C (10.1 °F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between 32 to 64 km (20 to 40 mi) downwind of cities, compared with upwind. Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.</p>
<p>Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1 percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1 percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25 percent).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Rainband" title="Rainband">Rainband</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rainband" title="Rainband">Rainbands</a> are <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">cloud</a> and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stratiform" title="Stratiform">stratiform</a> or <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_convection" title="Atmospheric convection">convective</a>, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on <a href="/wiki/Weather_radar" title="Weather radar">weather radar</a> imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm <a href="/wiki/Occluded_front" title="Occluded front">occluded fronts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Warm_front" title="Warm front">warm fronts</a> are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.</p>
<p>Rainbands spawned near and ahead of <a href="/wiki/Cold_front" title="Cold front">cold fronts</a> can be <a href="/wiki/Squall_line" title="Squall line">squall lines</a> which are able to produce <a href="/wiki/Tornado" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a>. Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barrier_jet" title="Barrier jet">barrier jet</a>. Bands of thunderstorms can form with <a href="/wiki/Sea_breeze" title="Sea breeze">sea breeze</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Land_breeze" title="Land breeze">land breeze</a> boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.</p>
<p>Once a cyclone occludes, a <b>tr</b>ough <b>o</b>f <b>w</b>arm air <b>al</b>oft, or "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trowal" title="Trowal">trowal</a>" for short, will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comma_(punctuation)" title="Comma (punctuation)">comma</a>-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" title="Extratropical cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> can yield significant amounts of rain. Behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. Offshore <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.</p>
<p>Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricane or tropical storm</a>. The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acidity">Acidity</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">Acid rain</a></div>
<p>The phrase <i>acid rain</i> was first used by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, especially due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that is derived from the Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a> (HNO<sub>3</sub>). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H<sub>2</sub>S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a <a href="/wiki/Buffer_solution" title="Buffer solution">buffer</a> in acid rain and raises the pH.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification" title="Köppen climate classification">Köppen climate classification</a></div>
<p>The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rain_forest" title="Rain forest">rain forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical_savanna" title="Tropical savanna">tropical savanna</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humid_subtropical" title="Humid subtropical">humid subtropical</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humid_continental" title="Humid continental">humid continental</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_climate" title="Oceanic climate">oceanic climate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_climate" title="Mediterranean climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steppe" title="Steppe">steppe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Subarctic_climate" title="Subarctic climate">subarctic climate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polar_ice_cap" title="Polar ice cap">polar ice cap</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">desert</a>.</p>
<p>Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000 mm (69 and 79 in). A tropical savanna is a <a href="/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grassland</a> <a href="/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">biome</a> located in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi-arid" title="Semi-arid">semi-arid</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humid" title="Humid">semi-humid</a> climate regions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subtropical" title="Subtropical">subtropical</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical">tropical</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latitudes" title="Latitudes">latitudes</a>, with rainfall between 750 and 1,270 mm (30 and 50 in) a year.

<p>Rain is measured in units of length per unit time, typically in millimeters per hour, or in countries where <a href="/wiki/Imperial_units" title="Imperial units">imperial units</a> are more common, inches per hour. The "length", or more accurately, "depth" being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat, horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time, typically an hour. One millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.</p>
<p>The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by 25 mm (0.98 in) of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25 mm (0.0098 in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25 mm (0.0098 in) markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.</p>
<p>When a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Community_Collaborative_Rain,_Hail_and_Snow_network" title="Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow network">CoCoRAHS</a> or GLOBE. If a network is not available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Weather_radar" title="Weather radar">Weather radar</a></div>

<p>One of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for <a href="/wiki/Hydrology" title="Hydrology">hydrological</a> purposes. For instance, river flood control, sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data. Radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration. To produce radar accumulations, rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points. A radar equation is then used, which is,</p>

<p>where Z represents the radar reflectivity, R represents the rainfall rate, and A and b are constants. Satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive <a href="/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwave</a> instruments aboard <a href="/wiki/Polar_orbit" title="Polar orbit">polar orbiting</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Geostationary_orbit" title="Geostationary orbit">geostationary</a> <a href="/wiki/Weather_satellite" title="Weather satellite">weather satellites</a> to indirectly measure rainfall rates. If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intensity">Intensity</span></h3>

<p>Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light rain — when the precipitation rate is &lt; 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per hour</li>
<li>Moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm (0.098 in) - 7.6 mm (0.30 in) or 10 mm (0.39 in) per hour</li>
<li>Heavy rain — when the precipitation rate is &gt; 7.6 mm (0.30 in) per hour, or between 10 mm (0.39 in) and 50 mm (2.0 in) per hour</li>
<li>Violent rain — when the precipitation rate is &gt; 50 mm (2.0 in) per hour</li>
</ul>
<p>Euphemisms for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer, trash-mover and toad-strangler. The intensity can also be expressed by rainfall erosivity. <a class="external text" href="http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/themes/erosion/RainfallErosivity/" rel="nofollow">R-factor</a></p>

<p>The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the <a href="/wiki/Return_period" title="Return period">return period</a> or frequency. The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location. The term <i>1 in 10 year storm</i> describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10 years, so it has a 10 percent likelihood any given year. The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. The term <i>1 in 100 year storm</i> describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1 percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event. As with all probability events, it is possible, though improbable, to have multiple "1 in 100 Year Storms" in a single year.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_precipitation_forecast" title="Quantitative precipitation forecast">Quantitative precipitation forecast</a></div>

<p>The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GMT" title="GMT">GMT</a>. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. <a href="/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction" title="Numerical weather prediction">Forecast models</a> show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the <a href="/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer" title="Planetary boundary layer">planetary boundary layer</a>, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher <a href="/wiki/Forecast_skill" title="Forecast skill">skill</a> than model forecasts within 6 to 7 hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.</p>

<p>Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. All <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a> need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crops" title="Crops">crops</a>. <a href="/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">Drought</a> can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful <a href="/wiki/Fungus" title="Fungus">fungus</a> growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain <a href="/wiki/Cactus" title="Cactus">cacti</a> require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.</p>
<p>In areas with wet and dry seasons, <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be <a href="/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting" title="Rainwater harvesting">harvested</a> through the use of <a href="/wiki/Rainwater_tank" title="Rainwater tank">rainwater tanks</a>; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation.

In dry places, such as <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, or during periods of <a href="/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">drought</a>, rain lifts people's moods. In <a href="/wiki/Botswana" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Setswana" title="Setswana">Setswana</a> word for rain, <i>pula</i>, is used as <a href="/wiki/Botswana_pula" title="Botswana pula">the name of the national currency</a>, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in this desert country. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as <a href="/wiki/Umbrella" title="Umbrella">umbrellas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Raincoat" title="Raincoat">raincoats</a>, and diversion devices such as <a href="/wiki/Rain_gutter" title="Rain gutter">gutters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Storm_drain" title="Storm drain">storm drains</a> that lead rains to sewers.

<p>Westerly flow from the mild north Atlantic leads to wetness across western Europe, in particular <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, where the western coasts can receive between 1,000 mm (39 in), at sea-level and 2,500 mm (98 in), on the mountains of rain per year. <a href="/wiki/Bergen" title="Bergen">Bergen</a>, Norway is one of the more famous European rain-cities with its yearly precipitation of 2,250 mm (89 in) on average. During the fall, winter, and <a href="/wiki/Spring_(season)" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>, Pacific storm systems bring most of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and the western United States much of their precipitation. Over the top of the ridge, the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. Large thunderstorm areas known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesoscale_Convective_Complex" title="Mesoscale Convective Complex">mesoscale convective complexes</a> move through the Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes during the warm season, contributing up to 10% of the annual precipitation to the region.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation" title="El Niño-Southern Oscillation">El Niño-Southern Oscillation</a> affects the precipitation distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States, Midwest, the Southeast, and throughout the tropics. There is also evidence that <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> is leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in the tropics and subtropics.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Cherrapunji" title="Cherrapunji">Cherrapunji</a>, situated on the southern slopes of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Himalaya" title="Himalaya">Eastern Himalaya</a> in <a href="/wiki/Shillong" title="Shillong">Shillong</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> is the confirmed wettest place on Earth, with an average annual rainfall of 11,430 mm (450 in). The highest recorded rainfall in a single year was 22,987 mm (905.0 in) in 1861. The 38-year average at nearby <a href="/wiki/Mawsynram" title="Mawsynram">Mawsynram</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meghalaya" title="Meghalaya">Meghalaya</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> is 11,873 mm (467.4 in). The wettest spot in Australia is <a href="/wiki/Mount_Bellenden_Ker" title="Mount Bellenden Ker">Mount Bellenden Ker</a> in the north-east of the country which records an average of 8,000 mm (310 in) per year, with over 12,200 mm (480.3 in) of rain recorded during 2000. <a href="/wiki/Mount_Waialeale" title="Mount Waialeale">Mount Waiʻaleʻale</a> on the island of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kaua%CA%BBi" title="Kauaʻi">Kauaʻi</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> averages more than 12,000 mm (460 in) of rain per year over the last 32 years, with a record 17,340 mm (683 in) in 1982. Its summit is considered one of the rainiest spots on earth. It has been promoted in tourist literature for many years as the wettest spot in the world. <a href="/wiki/Llor%C3%B3" title="Lloró">Lloró</a>, a town situated in <a href="/wiki/Choc%C3%B3_Department" title="Chocó Department">Chocó</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, is probably the place with the largest rainfall in the world, averaging 13,300 mm (523.6 in) per year. The Department of Chocó is extraordinarily humid. Tutunendaó, a small town situated in the same department, is one of the wettest estimated places on Earth, averaging 11,394 mm (448.6 in) per year; in 1974 the town received 26,303 mm (86 ft 3.6 in), the largest annual rainfall measured in Colombia. Unlike Cherrapunji, which receives most of its rainfall between April and September, Tutunendaó receives rain almost uniformly distributed throughout the year. <a href="/wiki/Quibd%C3%B3" title="Quibdó">Quibdó</a>, the capital of Chocó, receives the most rain in the world among cities with over 100,000 inhabitants: 9,000 mm (354 in) per year. Storms in Chocó can drop 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall in a day. This amount is more than what falls in many cities in a year's time.</p>
