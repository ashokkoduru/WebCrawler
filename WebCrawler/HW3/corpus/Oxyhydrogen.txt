<p><b>Oxyhydrogen</b> is a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> (H<sub>2</sub>) and <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> (O<sub>2</sub>) gases. This gaseous mixture is used for torches to process <a href="/wiki/Refractory" title="Refractory">refractory</a> materials and was the first gaseous mixture used for <a href="/wiki/Welding" title="Welding">welding</a>. Theoretically, a ratio of 2:1 hydrogen:oxygen is enough to achieve maximum efficiency; in practice a ratio 4:1 or 5:1 is needed to avoid an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidizing_flame" title="Oxidizing flame">oxidizing flame</a>.</p>
<p>This mixture may also be referred to as <i><b><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Knallgas</span></b></i> (Scandinavian and German <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Knallgas" title="wikt:Knallgas">Knallgas</a>: "bang-gas"), although some authors define knallgas to be a generic term for the mixture of fuel with the precise amount of oxygen required for complete combustion, thus 2:1 oxyhydrogen would be called "hydrogen-knallgas".</p>
<p><b>Brown's gas</b> and <b>HHO</b> are <a href="/wiki/Fringe_science" title="Fringe science">fringe science</a> terms for a 2:1 mixture of oxyhydrogen obtained under certain special conditions; its proponents claim that it has special properties.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties">Properties</span></h2>
<p>Oxyhydrogen will <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combust</a> when brought to its <a href="/wiki/Autoignition_temperature" title="Autoignition temperature">autoignition temperature</a>. For the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stoichiometric" title="Stoichiometric">stoichiometric</a> mixture, 2:1 hydrogen:oxygen, at normal <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>, autoignition occurs at about 570 °C (1065 °F). The minimum energy required to ignite such a mixture with a spark is about 20 <a href="/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">microjoules</a>. At <a href="/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure" title="Standard conditions for temperature and pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>, oxyhydrogen can burn when it is between about 4% and 95% hydrogen by volume.</p>
<p>When ignited, the gas mixture converts to <a href="/wiki/Water_vapor" title="Water vapor">water vapor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heat_of_combustion" title="Heat of combustion">releases energy</a>, which sustains the reaction: 241.8 <a href="/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">kJ</a> of energy (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lower_heating_value" title="Lower heating value">LHV</a>) for every <a href="/wiki/Mole_(unit)" title="Mole (unit)">mole</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">H</a><sub>2</sub> burned. The amount of heat energy released is independent of the mode of combustion, but the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flame_temperature" title="Flame temperature">temperature of the flame</a> varies. The maximum temperature of about 2,800 °C (5,100 °F) is achieved with an exact stoichiometric mixture, about 700 °C (1,300 °F) hotter than a hydrogen flame in air. When either of the gases are mixed in excess of this ratio, or when mixed with an <a href="/wiki/Inert_gas" title="Inert gas">inert gas</a> like nitrogen, the heat must spread throughout a greater quantity of matter and the temperature will be lower.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>A pure stoichiometric mixture may be obtained by <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water" title="Electrolysis of water">water electrolysis</a>, which uses an <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" title="Electric current">electric current</a> to dissociate the water molecules:</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/William_Nicholson_(chemist)" title="William Nicholson (chemist)">William Nicholson</a> was the first to decompose water in this manner in 1800. In theory, the input energy of a closed system will always equal the output energy, as the <a href="/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics" title="First law of thermodynamics">first law of thermodynamics</a> states. However, in practice no systems are perfectly closed, and the energy required to generate the oxyhydrogen will always exceed the energy released by combusting it, even at maximum practical efficiency, as the <a href="/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="Second law of thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a> implies. (See <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water#Efficiency" title="Electrolysis of water">Electrolysis of water#Efficiency</a>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Applications">Applications</span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lighting">Lighting</span></h3>
<p>Many forms of oxyhydrogen <a href="/wiki/Gas_lighting" title="Gas lighting">lamps</a> have been described, such as the <a href="/wiki/Limelight" title="Limelight">limelight</a>, which used an oxyhydrogen flame to heat a piece of <a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" title="Calcium oxide">lime</a> to <a href="/wiki/Black_body" title="Black body">white hot</a> <a href="/wiki/Incandescence" title="Incandescence">incandescence</a>. Because of the explosiveness of the oxyhydrogen, limelights have been replaced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_lighting" title="Electric lighting">electric lighting</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oxyhydrogen_blowpipe">Oxyhydrogen blowpipe</span></h3>

<p>The oxy-hydrogen <a href="/wiki/Blowpipe_(tool)" title="Blowpipe (tool)">blowpipe</a> was developed by <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Mineralogy" title="Mineralogy">mineralogist</a> <a href="/wiki/Edward_Daniel_Clarke" title="Edward Daniel Clarke">Edward Daniel Clarke</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemist</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hare_(chemist)" title="Robert Hare (chemist)">Robert Hare</a> in the early nineteenth century. It produced a flame hot enough to melt such <a href="/wiki/Refractory" title="Refractory">refractory</a> materials as <a href="/wiki/Platinum" title="Platinum">platinum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Porcelain" title="Porcelain">porcelain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fire_brick" title="Fire brick">fire brick</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Corundum" title="Corundum">corundum</a>, and was a valuable tool in several fields of science. It is used in the <a href="/wiki/Verneuil_process" title="Verneuil process">Verneuil process</a> to produce synthetic corundum.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oxyhydrogen_torch">Oxyhydrogen torch</span></h3>
<p>An <i>oxyhydrogen torch</i> is an <a href="/wiki/Oxy-fuel_welding_and_cutting#Hydrogen" title="Oxy-fuel welding and cutting">oxy-gas torch</a>, which burns hydrogen (the <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a>) with oxygen (the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidizer" title="Oxidizer">oxidizer</a>). It is used for cutting and <a href="/wiki/Welding" title="Welding">welding</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Thermoplastic" title="Thermoplastic">thermoplastics</a>.</p>
<p>Due to competition from the acetylene-fueled cutting torch and from arc welding, the oxyhydrogen torch is seldom used today, but it remains the preferred cutting tool in some niche applications—see <a href="/wiki/Oxy-fuel_welding_and_cutting" title="Oxy-fuel welding and cutting">oxy-fuel welding and cutting</a>.</p>
<p>Oxyhydrogen was once used in working <a href="/wiki/Platinum" title="Platinum">platinum</a> because at the time such a torch was the only device that could attain the temperature required to melt the metal 1,768.3 °C (3,214.9 °F). These techniques have been superseded by the <a href="/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace" title="Electric arc furnace">electric arc furnace</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Brown.27s_Gas">Brown's Gas <span id="HHO_gas"></span> <span id="Brown.27s_gas"></span></span></h2>
<p>"Brown's Gas" is oxyhydrogen with a 2:1 <a href="/wiki/Molar_concentration" title="Molar concentration">molar ratio</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">H<sub>2</sub></a> and <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">O<sub>2</sub></a> gases, the same proportion as in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_(molecule)" title="Water (molecule)">water</a>. It is named after Yull Brown, who claimed that it could be used as a fuel for the internal combustion engine. It's also called "HHO gas" after the claims of fringe physicist <a href="/wiki/Ruggero_Santilli#HHO_gas" title="Ruggero Santilli">Ruggero Santilli</a>, who claims that his HHO gas, produced by a special apparatus, is "a new form of water", with new properties, based on his <a href="/wiki/Fringe_theory" title="Fringe theory">fringe theory</a> of "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnecule" title="Magnecule">magnecules</a>".</p>
<p>Many other pseudoscientific claims have been made about Brown's Gas's pretended ability to neutralize radioactive waste, help plants to germinate, etc.</p>
<p>Oxyhydrogen is often mentioned in conjunction with <a href="/wiki/Water-fuelled_car" title="Water-fuelled car">vehicles that claim to use water as a fuel</a>. The most common and decisive counter-argument against producing this gas on board to use as a fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas. Additionally, the volume of gas that can be produced for on-demand consumption through electrolysis is very small in comparison to the volume consumed by an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>An article in <i><a href="/wiki/Popular_Mechanics" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a></i> reported that Brown's Gas does not increase the <a href="/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles" title="Fuel economy in automobiles">fuel economy in automobiles</a>.</p>
<p>"Water-fueled" cars should not be confused with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen-fueled_car" title="Hydrogen-fueled car">hydrogen-fueled cars</a>, where the hydrogen is produced elsewhere and used as fuel or where it is used <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel_enhancement" title="Hydrogen fuel enhancement">as fuel enhancement</a>.</p>
