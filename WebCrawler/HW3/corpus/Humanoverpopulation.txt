For the general concept of overpopulation, see <a href="/wiki/Overpopulation" title="Overpopulation">Overpopulation</a>.</div>





<p><b>Human overpopulation</b> occurs if the number of people in a group exceeds the <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> of the place occupied by that group. Overpopulation can further be viewed, in a long term perspective, as existing when a population cannot be maintained given the rapid depletion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-renewable_resources" title="Non-renewable resources">non-renewable resources</a> or given the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population.</p>
<p>The term <i>human overpopulation</i> often refers to the relationship between the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">entire human population</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)" title="Environment (biophysical)">environment</a>: the Earth, or to smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation can result from an increase in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_fertility_rate" title="List of countries and territories by fertility rate">births</a>, a decline in <a href="/wiki/Mortality_rate" title="Mortality rate">mortality rates</a>, an increase in <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a>, or an <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">unsustainable</a> <a href="/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">biome</a> and depletion of resources. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a <a href="/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">desert</a>). Advocates of population moderation cite issues like <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_life" title="Quality of life">quality of life</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> and risk of <a href="/wiki/Starvation" title="Starvation">starvation</a> as a basis to argue against continuing high human population growth and for <a href="/wiki/Population_decline" title="Population decline">population decline</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_population" title="Human population">Human population</a> has been growing continuously since the end of the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, around the year 1350, although the most significant increase has been in the last 50 years, mainly due to <a href="/wiki/History_of_medicine#Modern_medicine" title="History of medicine">medical advancements</a> and increase in agricultural productivity. The rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s. The United Nations has expressed concern on continued excessive population growth in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Recent research has demonstrated that those concerns are well grounded. As of November 11, 2016 the world's human population is estimated to be 7.463 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1000000000_(number)" title="1000000000 (number)">billion</a> by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, and over 7 billion by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> under existing conditions are between 4 billion and 16 billion. Depending on which estimate is used, human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred. Nevertheless, the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern. The population is <a href="/wiki/World_population_estimates" title="World population estimates">expected</a> to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the years 2040 and 2050. In May 2011, the United Nations increased the medium variant projections to 9.3 billion for 2050 and 10.1 billion for 2100.</p>
<p>The recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants. The <a href="/wiki/IAP_statement_on_population_growth" title="IAP statement on population growth">InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth</a>, circa 1994, stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_carbon_dioxide" title="Atmospheric carbon dioxide">atmospheric carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, are aggravated by the population expansion. Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food, <a href="/wiki/Starvation" title="Starvation">starvation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, consumption of natural resources (such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>) faster than the rate of regeneration, and a deterioration in living conditions. Wealthy but highly populated territories like <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> rely on food imports from overseas. This was severely felt during the <a href="/wiki/World_war#The_World_Wars" title="World war">World Wars</a> when, despite food efficiency initiatives like "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dig_for_victory#World_War_II" title="Dig for victory">dig for victory</a>" and <a href="/wiki/Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Rationing in the United Kingdom">food rationing</a>, Britain needed to <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic" title="Battle of the Atlantic">fight to secure import routes</a>. However, many believe that waste and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Over-consumption" title="Over-consumption">over-consumption</a>, especially by wealthy nations, is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation.</p>
<p>Most countries have no direct policy of limiting their birth rates, but the rates have still fallen due to education about family planning and increasing access to birth control and contraception. Only <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> has imposed <a href="/wiki/One-child_policy" title="One-child policy">legal restrictions on having more than one child</a>. <a href="/wiki/Space_colonization" title="Space colonization">Extraterrestrial settlement</a> and other technical solutions have been proposed as ways to mitigate overpopulation in the future.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_concern">History of concern</span></h2>

<p>Concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic. <a href="/wiki/Tertullian" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> was a resident of the city of <a href="/wiki/Carthage" title="Carthage">Carthage</a> in the second century <a href="/wiki/Common_Era" title="Common Era">CE</a>, when the population of the world was about 190 million (only 3-4% of what it is today). He notably said: "What most frequently meets our view (and occasions complaint) is our teeming population. Our numbers are burdensome to the world, which can hardly support us.... In very deed, pestilence, and famine, and wars, and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations, as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race." Before that, <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and others broached the topic as well.</p>
<p>Throughout history, population growth has usually been slow despite high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Birth_rates" title="Birth rates">birth rates</a>, due to war, <a href="/wiki/Plague_(disease)" title="Plague (disease)">plagues</a> and other diseases, and high <a href="/wiki/Infant_mortality" title="Infant mortality">infant mortality</a>. During the 750 years before the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, the world's population increased very slowly, remaining under 250 million.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 19th century, the world population had grown to a billion individuals, and intellectuals such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> predicted that mankind would outgrow its available resources, because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase. <a href="/wiki/Mercantilism" title="Mercantilism">Mercantillists</a> argued that a large population was a form of wealth, which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, Malthus's work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run. This resulted, for example, in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/English_poor_laws" title="English poor laws">English poor laws</a> of 1834 and in a hesitating response to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)" title="Great Famine (Ireland)">Irish Great Famine</a> of 1845–52.</p>
<p>The UN Population Assessment Report of 2004 projects that the world population will plateau by 2050 and will remain stable until 2300.  More recent UN projections suggest the population could grow to as many as 15 billion by 2100.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">World population</a></div>


<p>The human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of <a href="/wiki/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilization</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Holocene" title="Holocene">Holocene</a> period, around 10,000 BCE. The beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glacial_ice" title="Glacial ice">glacial ice</a> following the end of the <a href="/wiki/Last_glacial_period" title="Last glacial period">last glacial period</a>. It is estimated that between 1-5 million people, subsisting on hunting and <a href="/wiki/Foraging" title="Foraging">foraging</a>, inhabited the Earth in the period before the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>, when human activity shifted away from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hunter_gatherer#History" title="Hunter gatherer">hunter-gathering</a> and towards <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oasis_Theory" title="Oasis Theory">very primitive farming</a>.</p>
<p>Around 8000 BCE, at the <a href="/wiki/Agriculture#History" title="Agriculture">dawn of agriculture</a>, the population of the world was approximately 5 million. The next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population, with very rapid growth beginning in 1000 BCE, and a peak of between 200 and 300 million people in 1 BCE.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian" title="Plague of Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> caused <a href="/wiki/Medieval_demography" title="Medieval demography">Europe's population</a> to drop by around 50% between 541 and the 8th century. Steady growth resumed in 800 CE. However, growth was again disrupted by frequent <a href="/wiki/Plague_(disease)" title="Plague (disease)">plagues</a>; most notably, the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> during the 14th century. The effects of the Black Death are thought to have reduced the world's population, then at an estimated 450 million, to between 350 and 375 million by 1400. The population of Europe stood at over 70 million in 1340; these levels did not return until 200 years later. England's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650, up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500. New crops from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the population growth.</p>
<p>In other parts of the globe, China's population at the founding of the <a href="/wiki/Ming_dynasty" title="Ming dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> in 1368 stood close to 60 million, approaching 150 million by the end of the dynasty in 1644. The population of the Americas in 1500 may have been between 50 and 100 million.</p>
<p>Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local <a href="/wiki/List_of_epidemics" title="List of epidemics">epidemics</a> of extraordinary virulence. Archaeological evidence indicates that the death of around 90% of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_history_of_American_indigenous_peoples" title="Population history of American indigenous peoples">Native American population</a> of the <a href="/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> was caused by <a href="/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> diseases such as <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, measles, and influenza. Europeans introduced diseases alien to the indigenous people, therefore they did not have immunity to these foreign diseases.</p>
<p>After the start of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, during the 18th century, the rate of population growth began to increase. By the end of the century, the world's population was estimated at just under 1 billion. At the turn of the 20th century, the world's population was roughly 1.6 billion. By 1940, this figure had increased to 2.3 billion.</p>

<p>Dramatic growth beginning in 1950 (above 1.8% per year) coincided with greatly increased food production as a result of the industrialization of agriculture brought about by the <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>. The rate of human population growth peaked in 1964, at about 2.1% per year. For example, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>'s population grew from 97 million in 1961 to 237.6 million in 2010, a 145% increase in 49 years. In <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, the population grew from 361.1 million people in 1951 to just over 1.2 billion by 2011, a 235% increase in 60 years.</p>

<p>There is concern over the sharp population increase in many countries, especially in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, that has occurred over the last several decades, and that it is creating problems with land management, natural resources and access to water supplies.</p>
<p>The population of <a href="/wiki/Chad" title="Chad">Chad</a> has, for example, grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009. <a href="/wiki/Niger" title="Niger">Niger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uganda" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nigeria" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tanzania" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">DRC</a> are witnessing a similar growth in population. The situation is most acute in western, central and eastern Africa. Refugees from places like <a href="/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> have further strained the resources of neighboring states like Chad and Egypt. Chad is also host to roughly 255,000 <a href="/wiki/Refugee" title="Refugee">refugees</a> from Sudan's <a href="/wiki/Darfur" title="Darfur">Darfur</a> region, and about 77,000 refugees from the <a href="/wiki/Central_African_Republic" title="Central African Republic">Central African Republic</a>, while approximately 188,000 Chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines, have either fled to either the Sudan, the Niger or, more recently, <a href="/wiki/Libya" title="Libya">Libya</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Projections_of_population_growth">Projections of population growth</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth" title="Projections of population growth">Projections of population growth</a></div>

<p>According to projections, the world population will continue to grow until at least 2050, with the population reaching 9 billion in 2040, and some <a href="/wiki/World_population#Forecasts" title="World population">predictions</a> putting the population as high as 11 billion in 2050. By 2100, the population could reach 15 billion. <a href="/wiki/Walter_Greiling" title="Walter Greiling">Walter Greiling</a> projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion, in the 21st century, and then stop growing, after a readjustment of the <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> and a sanitation of the tropics.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects report:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world population</a> is currently growing by approximately 74 million people per year. Current United Nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach 9.0 billion around 2050, assuming a decrease in average <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertility_rate" title="Fertility rate">fertility rate</a> from 2.5 down to 2.0.</li>
<li>Almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions, where today's 5.3 billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to 7.8 billion in 2050. By contrast, the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged, at 1.2 billion. An exception is the United States population, which is expected to increase by 44% from 2008 to 2050.</li>
<li>In 2000–2005, the average world fertility was 2.65 children per woman, about half the level in 1950–1955 (5 children per woman). In the medium variant, global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.05 children per woman.</li>
<li>During 2005–2050, nine countries are expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase: <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, Pakistan, <a href="/wiki/Nigeria" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, Democratic Republic of the Congo, <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, Uganda, United States, Ethiopia, and China, listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth. China would be higher still in this list were it not for its <a href="/wiki/One-child_policy" title="One-child policy">one-child policy</a>.</li>
<li>Global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from 65 years in 2000–2005 to 75 years in 2045–2050. In the more developed regions, the projection is to 82 years by 2050. Among the least developed countries, where life expectancy today is just under 50 years, it is expected to increase to 66 years by 2045–2050.</li>
<li>The population of 51 countries or areas is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.</li>
<li>During 2005–2050, the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million. Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 2005–2050, population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration.</li>
<li>In 2000–2005, net migration in 28 countries either prevented <a href="/wiki/Population_decline" title="Population decline">population decline</a> or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to population growth.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_fertility_rate" title="List of countries and territories by fertility rate">Birth rates</a> are now falling in a small percentage of <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a>, while the actual populations in many <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed countries</a> would fall without immigration.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Urban_growth">Urban growth</span></h3>

<p>In 1800 only 3% of the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world's population</a> lived in cities. By the 20th century's close, 47% did so. In 1950 there were 83 cities with populations exceeding one million; but by 2007 this had risen to 468 agglomerations of more than one million. If the trend continues, the world's <a href="/wiki/Metropolis" title="Metropolis">urban population</a> will double every 38 years, according to researchers. The UN forecasts that today's urban population of 3.2 billion will rise to nearly 5 billion by 2030, when three out of five people will live in cities.</p>
<p>The increase will be most dramatic in the poorest and least-urbanised continents, Asia and Africa. Projections indicate that most urban growth over the next 25 years will be in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a>. One billion people, one-seventh of the world's population, or one-third of urban population, now live in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shanty_towns" title="Shanty towns">shanty towns</a>, which are seen as "breeding grounds" for social problems such as crime, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drug_addiction" title="Drug addiction">drug addiction</a>, alcoholism, poverty and unemployment. In many poor countries, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slums" title="Slums">slums</a> exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of basic health care.</p>
<p>In 2000, there were 18 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megacities" title="Megacities">megacities</a> – <a href="/wiki/Conurbation" title="Conurbation">conurbations</a> such as Tokyo, <a href="/wiki/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karachi" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, Mexico City, <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, São Paulo and New York City – that have populations in excess of 10 million inhabitants. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greater_Tokyo" title="Greater Tokyo">Greater Tokyo</a> already has 35 million, more than the entire population of Canada (at 34.1 million).</p>
<p>According to the <i>Far Eastern Economic Review</i>, Asia alone will have at least 10 'hypercities' by 2025, that is, cities inhabited by more than 19 million people, including <a href="/wiki/Jakarta" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> (24.9 million people), <a href="/wiki/Dhaka" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> (25 million), <a href="/wiki/Karachi" title="Karachi">Karachi</a> (26.5 million), <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> (27 million) and <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> (33 million). <a href="/wiki/Lagos" title="Lagos">Lagos</a> has grown from 300,000 in 1950 to an estimated 15 million today, and the Nigerian government estimates that city will have expanded to 25 million residents by 2015. Chinese experts forecast that Chinese cities will contain 800 million people by 2020.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes">Causes</span></h2>

<p>From a historical perspective, <a href="/wiki/Technological_revolution" title="Technological revolution">technological revolutions</a> have coincided with population explosions. There have been three major technological revolutions – the tool-making revolution, the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">agricultural revolution</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> – all of which allowed humans more access to food, resulting in subsequent population explosions. For example, the use of tools, such as bow and arrow, allowed primitive hunters greater access to high energy foods (e.g. animal meat). Similarly, the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply, which was used to support more people. Food production further increased with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> as machinery, <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicides</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a> were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields. In short, similar to <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> that multiply in response to increased food supply, humans have increased their population as soon as food became more abundant as a result of technological innovations.</p>
<p>Significant increases in human population occur whenever the <a href="/wiki/Birth_rate" title="Birth rate">birth rate</a> exceeds the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_rate" title="Death rate">death rate</a> for extended periods of time. Traditionally, the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social, technological, or environmental conditions. For example, when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century – as a result of improved sanitation, child immunizations, and other advances in medicine – allowing more newborns to survive, the fertility rate did not adjust downward fast enough, resulting in significant population growth. Prior to these changes, seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age, while today about 95% of newborns in industrialized nations reach adulthood.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture">Agriculture</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> has been the main factor behind human population growth. This dates back to prehistoric times, when agricultural methods were first developed, and continues to the present day, with fertilizers, agrochemicals, large-scale mechanization, genetic manipulation, and other technologies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychological_factors">Psychological factors</span></h3>
<p>Human <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> and the cycle of entrenched <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, as well as the rest of the world's reaction to it, are also causative factors. Areas with greater burden of disease and warfare, contrary to popular belief, do not experience less population growth over the long term, but far more over a sustained period as poverty becomes further entrenched</p>

<p> . This is because parents and siblings who have experienced calamitous conditions suffer from a kind of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_traumatic_stress_syndrome" title="Post traumatic stress syndrome">post traumatic stress syndrome</a> about losing their family members and overcompensate by having "extra" babies. These extra babies and calamities fuel a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vicious_cycle" title="Vicious cycle">vicious cycle</a>, and only in the small minority of cases does it cease</p>

<p> . As this cycle is compounded over generations, calamities such as disaster or war take on a <a href="/wiki/Multiplier_(economics)" title="Multiplier (economics)">multiplier effect</a>. For example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AIDS_in_Africa" title="AIDS in Africa">AIDS crisis in Africa</a> is said to have killed 30 million to date, yet during the last two decades money and initiatives to lower population growth by contraception have been sidelined in favor of combating <a href="/wiki/HIV" title="HIV">HIV</a>, feeding the population explosion that we see in Africa today. In 1990, this continent's population was roughly 600 million; today it is over 1,050 million, 150 million more than if the HIV/AIDS crisis had never occurred.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extremes">Extremes</span></h2>
<p>Population growth rates between 1950 and 2012 range from a 0.5% increase in the case of Bulgaria to a more than 100 fold increase for the United Arab Emirates (from 79,050 to 8.5 million). Roughly half of all nations have quadrupled their populations since 1950.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Demographic_transition">Demographic transition</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Demographic_transition" title="Demographic transition">Demographic transition</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility" title="Sub-replacement fertility">Sub-replacement fertility</a></div>
<p>The theory of demographic transition held that, after the <a href="/wiki/Standard_of_living" title="Standard of living">standard of living</a> and <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> increase, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Family_size" title="Family size">family sizes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Birth_rate" title="Birth rate">birth rates</a> decline. However, as new data has become available, it has been observed that after a certain level of development (<a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">HDI</a> equal to 0.86 or higher) the fertility increases again. This means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth are misguided.</p>
<p>Factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage, the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Child_rearing" title="Child rearing">child rearing</a> and domestic work, and the decreased need of children in industrialized settings. The latter factor stems from the fact that children <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Child_labor" title="Child labor">perform a great deal of work</a> in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.</p>
<p>Many countries have high population growth rates but lower <a href="/wiki/Total_fertility_rate" title="Total fertility rate">total fertility rates</a> because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.</p>
<p>"Demographic entrapment" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Leeds" title="University of Leeds">University of Leeds</a>, who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity, no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food. This will cause starvation. He claims that for example many sub-Saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment, instead of having a demographic transition.</p>
<p>For the world as a whole, the number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_fertility_rate" title="List of countries and territories by fertility rate">children born per woman</a> decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005. A breakdown by region is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Europe – 2.66 to 1.41</li>
<li>North America – 3.47 to 1.99</li>
<li>Oceania – 3.87 to 2.30</li>
<li>Central America – 6.38 to 2.66</li>
<li>South America – 5.75 to 2.49</li>
<li>Asia (excluding Middle East) – 5.85 to 2.43</li>
<li>Middle East &amp; North Africa – 6.99 to 3.37</li>
<li>Sub-Saharan Africa – 6.7 to 5.53</li>
</ul>
<p>Excluding the observed reversal in fertility decrease for high development, the projected world number of children born per woman for 2050 would be around 2.05. Only the Middle East &amp; North Africa (2.09) and Sub-Saharan Africa (2.61) would then have numbers greater than 2.05.</p>

Humanity as a whole was using, by 2006, 40 percent more than what Earth can regenerate. However, <a href="/wiki/Roger_Martin_(diplomat)" title="Roger Martin (diplomat)">Roger Martin</a> of <a href="/wiki/Population_Matters" title="Population Matters">Population Matters</a> states the view: "the poor want to get rich, and I want them to get rich," with a later addition, "of course we have to change consumption habits,... but we've also got to stabilise our numbers".</p>
<p>But critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating Ecological Footprints. Therefore, Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results – reviews have been produced by France, Germany, the European Commission, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. Some point out that a more refined method of assessing Ecological Footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption. However, if yield estimates were adjusted for sustainable levels of production, the yield figures would be lower, and hence the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Overshoot_(ecology)" title="Overshoot (ecology)">overshoot</a> estimated by the Ecological Footprint method even higher.</p>
<p>Other studies give particular attention to <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource depletion</a> and increased world affluence. </p>
<p>In a 1994 study titled <i>Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy</i>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=David_Pimentel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David Pimentel (page does not exist)">David Pimentel</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Mario_Giampietro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Mario Giampietro (page does not exist)">Mario Giampietro</a> estimated the maximum <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._population" title="U.S. population">U.S. population</a> for a <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainable economy</a> at 200 million.

<p>Many quantitative studies have estimated the world's carrying capacity for humans, that is, a limit to the world population. A meta-analysis of 69 such studies suggests a point estimate of the limit to be 7.7 billion people, while lower and upper meta-bounds for current technology are estimated as 0.65 and 98 billion people, respectively. They conclude: "recent predictions of stabilized world population levels for 2050 exceed several of our meta-estimates of a world population limit".</p>

<p>Humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides raw population.

In 2008, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population.</p>

<p>Some economists, such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Sowell" title="Thomas Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_E._Williams" title="Walter E. Williams">Walter E. Williams</a> argue that third world poverty and <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a> are caused in part by bad government and bad economic policies. Most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life. Some <a href="/wiki/Deep_ecology" title="Deep ecology">deep ecologists</a>, such as the radical thinker and polemicist <a href="/wiki/Pentti_Linkola" title="Pentti Linkola">Pentti Linkola</a>, see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Resources">Resources</span></h2>
<p>Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population, but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources. It also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population.</p>
<p>The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">clean water</a>, clean air, food, shelter, warmth, and other resources necessary to sustain life. If the quality of human life is addressed, there may be additional resources considered, such as medical care, education, proper <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">sewage treatment</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waste_disposal" title="Waste disposal">waste disposal</a> and energy supplies. Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources, leading to a diminished quality of life.</p>
<p>Directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply, and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain. With the global population at about 7.125 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 14.25 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation. Irrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles. </p>

<p><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=David_Pimentel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David Pimentel (page does not exist)">David Pimentel</a> has stated that "With the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources, humans must actively conserve cropland, freshwater, energy, and biological resources. There is a need to develop renewable energy resources. Humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the Earth's resources and diminishes human well-being."</p>
<p>These reflect the comments also of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey" title="United States Geological Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> in their paper <a class="external text" href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=653" rel="nofollow">The Future of Planet Earth: Scientific Challenges in the Coming Century</a>. "As the global population continues to grow...people will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet, including mineral and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_resources" title="Energy resources">energy resources</a>, open space, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_crisis" title="Water crisis">water</a>, and plant and animal resources." "Earth's natural wealth: an audit" by <i><a href="/wiki/New_Scientist" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a></i> magazine states that many of the minerals that we use for a variety of products are in danger of running out in the near future. A handful of geologists around the world have calculated the costs of new technologies in terms of the materials they use and the implications of their spreading to the developing world. All agree that the planet's booming population and rising standards of living are set to put unprecedented demands on the materials that only Earth itself can provide. Limitations on how much of these materials is available could even mean that some technologies are not worth pursuing long term.... "Virgin stocks of several metals appear inadequate to sustain the modern 'developed world' quality of life for all of Earth's people under contemporary technology".</p>
<p>On the other hand, some <a href="/wiki/Cornucopian" title="Cornucopian">cornucopian</a> researchers, such as <a href="/wiki/Julian_Simon" title="Julian Simon">Julian L. Simon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_Lomborg" title="Bjørn Lomborg">Bjørn Lomborg</a> believe that resources exist for further population growth. In a 2010 study, they concluded that "there are not (and will never be) too many people for the planet to feed" according to <a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a>. Some critics warn, this will be at a high cost to the Earth: "the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades...[however] the environmental cost of what Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich describe as 'turning the Earth into a giant human feedlot' could be severe. A large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, loss of <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soil_erosion" title="Soil erosion">soil erosion</a>, and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production." Since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the Earth, some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Ecosystem_Assessment" title="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a>, a four-year research effort by 1,360 of the world's prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world, "The structure of the world's ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history, and virtually all of Earth's ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions." "Ecosystem services, particularly food production, timber and fisheries, are important for employment and economic activity. Intensive use of ecosystems often produces the greatest short-term advantage, but excessive and unsustainable use can lead to losses in the long term. A country could cut its forests and deplete its fisheries, and this would show only as a positive gain to GDP, despite the loss of capital assets. If the full economic value of ecosystems were taken into account in decision-making, their degradation could be significantly slowed down or even reversed."</p>
<p>Another study by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) called the <a href="/wiki/Global_Environment_Outlook" title="Global Environment Outlook">Global Environment Outlook</a> which involved 1,400 scientists and took five years to prepare comes to similar conclusions. It "found that human consumption had far outstripped available resources. Each person on Earth now requires a third more land to supply his or her needs than the planet can supply." It faults a failure to "respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet... 'The systematic destruction of the Earth's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged – and where the bill we hand to our children may prove impossible to pay'... The report's authors say its objective is 'not to present a dark and gloomy scenario, but an urgent call to action'. It warns that tackling the problems may affect the vested interests of powerful groups, and that the environment must be moved to the core of decision-making... '</p>
<p>Although all resources, whether mineral or other, are limited on the planet, there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced. For example, in 1990 known reserves of many natural resources were higher, and their prices lower, than in 1970, despite higher demand and higher consumption. Whenever a price spike would occur, the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fresh_water">Fresh water</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_crisis" title="Water crisis">Water crisis</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fresh_water" title="Fresh water">Fresh water</a> supplies, on which agriculture depends, are running low worldwide. This <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_crisis" title="Water crisis">water crisis</a> is only expected to worsen as the population increases.</p>
<p>Potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below, however, the majority of the world's freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps, and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells.</p>
<p>Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">desalination</a>. For example, <a href="/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a> derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination. A number of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear powered</a> desalination plants exist; However, the high costs of desalination, especially for poor countries, make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries. The cost of desalination varies; <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter, <a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> at 49 cents per cubic meter. In the United States, the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter ($3.06 for 1,000 gallons).</p>
<p>According to a 2004 study by Zhou and Tol, "one needs to lift the water by 2000 m, or transport it over more than 1600 km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs. Desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as <a href="/wiki/Riyadh" title="Riyadh">Riyadh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harare" title="Harare">Harare</a>. In other places, the dominant cost is desalination, not transport. This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing, <a href="/wiki/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zaragoza" title="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix</a>, and, of course, coastal cities like <a href="/wiki/Tripoli" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>." Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans, it concludes that "Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation. Unfortunately, that includes some of the places with biggest water problems." Another potential problem with desalination is the byproduction of saline <a href="/wiki/Brine" title="Brine">brine</a>, which can be a major cause of marine pollution when dumped back into the oceans at high temperatures."</p>
<p>The world's largest desalination plant is the <a href="/wiki/Jebel_Ali" title="Jebel Ali">Jebel Ali</a> Desalination Plant (Phase 2) in the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, which can produce 300 million cubic metres of water per year, or about 2500 gallons per second. The largest desalination plant in the US is the one at <a href="/wiki/Tampa_Bay" title="Tampa Bay">Tampa Bay</a>, Florida, which began desalinating 25 million gallons (95000 m³) of water per day in December 2007. A 17 January 2008, article in the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> states, "Worldwide, 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day, according to the International Desalination Association." After being desalinated at <a href="/wiki/Jubail" title="Jubail">Jubail</a>, Saudi Arabia, water is pumped 200 miles (320 km) inland though a pipeline to the capital city of <a href="/wiki/Riyadh" title="Riyadh">Riyadh</a>.</p>
<p>However, new data originating from the <a href="/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment" title="Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment">GRACE</a> experiments and isotopic testing done by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IAEA" title="IAEA">IAEA</a> show that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nubian_aquifer" title="Nubian aquifer">Nubian aquifer</a>—which is under the largest, driest part of the earth's surface, has enough water in it to provide for "at least several centuries". In addition to this, new and highly detailed maps of the earth's underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food">Food</span></h3>
<p>Some scientists argue that there is enough food to support the world population, and some dispute this, particularly if sustainability is taken into account.</p>
<p>Many countries rely heavily on imports. <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a> rely on imports for 40% of their grain supply. <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> import more than 90%. And just 6 countries – <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, Australia, Canada, France, <a href="/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and the USA – supply 90% of grain exports. In recent decades the US alone supplied almost half of world grain exports.</p>
<p>A 2001 United Nations report says population growth is "the main force driving increases in agricultural demand" but "most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future (that is to say, until approximately 2030 or 2050)", assuming declining population growth rates.</p>
<p>However, the observed figures for 2007 show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, 923 million in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995.; the more recent FAO estimates point to an even more dramatic increase, to 1.02 billion in 2009.</p>

<p>The amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed, and their distribution is not necessarily a <a href="/wiki/Zero-sum_game" title="Zero-sum game">zero-sum game</a>. For example, due to the <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a> and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes, the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until 1995. World food production per person was considerably higher in 2005 than 1961.</p>
<p>As world population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion, daily <a href="/wiki/Calorie" title="Calorie">calorie</a> consumption in poor countries increased from 1,932 to 2,650, and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45% to 18%. This suggests that Third World poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment, not overpopulation. However, others question these statistics. From 1950 to 1984, as the <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a> transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%. The world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution and most believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a> than the UN presently documents.</p>
<p>The number of <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">people who are overweight</a> has surpassed the number who are undernourished. In a 2006 news story, <a href="/wiki/MSNBC" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> reported, "There are an estimated 800 million undernourished people and more than a billion considered overweight worldwide." The U.S. has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. However, studies show that wealthy and educated people are far likelier to eat healthy food, indicating obesity is a disease related to poverty and lack of education and excessive advertising of unhealthy eatables at cheaper cost, high in calories, with little nutritive value are consumed.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> of the United Nations states in its report <i>The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006</i>, that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million, a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 1990–92: 17% against 20%. Furthermore, FAO's projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from 1990–92 levels to 10% by 2015. The FAO also states "We have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community. The world is richer today than it was ten years ago. There is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices. The knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there. What is lacking is sufficient political will to mobilize those resources to the benefit of the hungry."</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_as_a_function_of_food_availability">Population as a function of food availability</span></h4>
<p>Thinkers from a wide range of academic fields and political backgrounds—including agricultural scientist David Pimentel, behavioral scientist Russell Hopfenberg, right-wing anthropologist <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Abernethy" title="Virginia Abernethy">Virginia Abernethy</a>, ecologist <a href="/wiki/Garrett_Hardin" title="Garrett Hardin">Garrett Hardin</a>, ecologist and anthropologist <a href="/wiki/Peter_Farb" title="Peter Farb">Peter Farb</a>, journalist <a href="/wiki/Richard_Manning" title="Richard Manning">Richard Manning</a>, environmental biologist Alan D. Thornhill, cultural critic and writer <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Quinn" title="Daniel Quinn">Daniel Quinn</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anarcho-primitivist" title="Anarcho-primitivist">anarcho-primitivist</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Zerzan" title="John Zerzan">John Zerzan</a>,—propose that, like all other animal populations, human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply, growing during an abundance of food and shrinking in times of scarcity.</p>
<p>Proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased, the population grows. Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> and its increased food supply. This was, subsequent to the <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>, followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that "intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population." Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon, which he calls the "<a href="/wiki/Food_Race" title="Food Race">Food Race</a>" (comparable, in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe, to the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race" title="Nuclear arms race">nuclear arms race</a>).</p>
<p>Critics of this theory point out that, in the modern era, birth rates are lowest in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developed_nation" title="Developed nation">developed nations</a>, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan, and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005. This shows that, limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary, particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. However, the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major <i>exporters</i> of food to poorer populations, so that, "it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas (Allaby, 1984; Pimentel et al., 1999) that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled."</p>
<p>Regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability, the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">human population</a> is, on the global scale, undeniably increasing, as is the net quantity of human food produced — a pattern that has been true for roughly 10,000 years, since the human development of agriculture. The fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole, since the world has become a <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalized system</a> with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity. Hopfenberg and Pimentel's findings support both this and Quinn's direct accusation that "First World farmers are fueling the Third World population explosion." Additionally, the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study, as in Germany's recent population trends; clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contraceptive" title="Contraceptive">contraceptive</a> access, educational programs, cultural norms and, most influentially, differing economic realities from nation to nation.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_deficits" title="Water deficits">Water deficits</a>, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as China or India, if technology is not used. The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) owing to widespread <a href="/wiki/Overdrafting" title="Overdrafting">overdrafting</a> beyond <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable" title="Sustainable">sustainable</a> yields. Other countries affected include Pakistan, <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, and Mexico. This overdrafting is already leading to <a href="/wiki/Water_scarcity" title="Water scarcity">water scarcity</a> and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aquifers" title="Aquifers">aquifers</a>, China has developed a grain deficit. This effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_shortages" title="Water shortages">water shortages</a>. One suggested solution is for <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a> to be slowed quickly by investing heavily in female <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="Literacy">literacy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning">family planning</a> services. <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">Desalination</a> is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages.</p>
<p>After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits – <a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, Egypt, <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, Mexico, and Pakistan.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Land">Land</span></h3>

<p>The World Resources Institute states that "Agricultural conversion to croplands and managed <a href="/wiki/Pasture" title="Pasture">pastures</a> has affected some 3.3 billion [hectares] – roughly 26 percent of the land area. All totaled, agriculture has displaced one-third of <a href="/wiki/Temperate_forest" title="Temperate forest">temperate</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tropical_forest" title="Tropical forest">tropical forests</a> and one-quarter of natural grasslands." Forty percent of the land area is under conversion and fragmented; less than one quarter, primarily in the Arctic and the deserts, remains intact. Usable land may become less useful through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salinization" title="Salinization">salinization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Desertification" title="Desertification">desertification</a>, <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Urban_sprawl" title="Urban sprawl">urban sprawl</a>. <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> may cause flooding of many of the most productive agricultural areas. The development of energy sources may also require large areas, for example, the building of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_dams" title="Hydroelectric dams">hydroelectric dams</a>. Thus, available useful land may become a limiting factor. By most estimates, at least half of cultivable land is already being farmed, and there are concerns that the remaining reserves are greatly overestimated.</p>
<p>High <a href="/wiki/Crop_yield" title="Crop yield">crop yield</a> vegetables like potatoes and lettuce use less space on inedible plant parts, like stalks, husks, vines, and inedible leaves. New varieties of selectively bred and <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrid</a> plants have larger edible parts (fruit, vegetable, grain) and smaller inedible parts; however, many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic, and new advances are more difficult to achieve. With new technologies, it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions. <a href="/wiki/Aquaculture" title="Aquaculture">Aquaculture</a> could theoretically increase available area. <a href="/wiki/Hydroponics" title="Hydroponics">Hydroponics</a> and food from bacteria and fungi, like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quorn_(food_product)" title="Quorn (food product)">quorn</a>, may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality, climate, or even available sunlight, although such a process may be very energy-intensive. Some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some <a href="/wiki/Marginal_land" title="Marginal land">marginal land</a> can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like <a href="/wiki/Slash-and-burn" title="Slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> agriculture. Even with the modern techniques of agriculture, the sustainability of production is in question.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> and particularly the Emirate of <a href="/wiki/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> have constructed large artificial islands, or have created large dam and dike systems, like the Netherlands, which reclaim land from the sea to increase their total land area.

The notion that space is limited has been decried by skeptics, who point out that the Earth's population of roughly 6.8 billion people could comfortably be housed an area comparable in size to the state of Texas, in the United States (about 269,000 square miles or 696,706.80 square kilometres). However, the impact of humanity extends over a far greater area than that required simply for housing.</p>

<p>The United Nations indicates that about 850 million people are <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnourished</a> or <a href="/wiki/Starvation" title="Starvation">starving</a>, and 1.1 billion people <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_crisis" title="Water crisis">do not have access</a> to safe <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a>. Some argue that Earth may support 6 billion people, but only if many live in misery. The proportion of the world's population living on less than $1 per day has halved in 20 years, but these are inflation-unadjusted numbers and likely misleading. Since 1980, the global economy has grown by 380 percent, but the number of people living on less than $5 a day increased by more than 1.1 billion.</p>
<p>The UN <a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Report" title="Human Development Report">Human Development Report</a> of 1997 states: "During the last 15–20 years, more than 100 developing countries, and several Eastern European countries, have suffered from disastrous growth failures. The reductions in <a href="/wiki/Standard_of_living" title="Standard of living">standard of living</a> have been deeper and more long-lasting than what was seen in the industrialised countries during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_depression" title="Great depression">depression in the 1930s</a>. As a result, the income for more than one billion people has fallen below the level that was reached 10, 20 or 30 years ago". Similarly, although the proportion of "starving" people in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> has decreased, the absolute number of starving people has increased due to population growth. The percentage dropped from 38% in 1970 to 33% in 1996 and was expected to be 30% by 2010. But the region's population roughly doubled between 1970 and 1996. To keep the numbers of starving constant, the percentage would have dropped by more than half.</p>

<p>As of 2004, there were 108 countries in the world with more than five million people. All of these in which women have, on the average, more than 4 children in their lifetime, have a per capita GDP of less than $5000. Only in two countries with per capita GDP above ~$15,000 do women have, on the average, more than 2 children in their lifetime: these are Israel and Saudi Arabia, with average lifetime births per woman between 2 and 4.</p>
<p>As their income increases, women are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Women%27s_liberation" title="Women's liberation">liberated</a> and tend to have fewer "quantity kids", as in two in place of six.</p>
<p>The correlation does not imply cause and effect, and can be linked to the interplay of birth rates, death rates and economic development.</p>
<p>Poor living conditions can also cause a very bad effect on the population; diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS can also contribute to this. Lack of nutrients, poor sanitation and poor health institutions. Death rate and birth rate can also have a negative effect on the population.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</span></h2>

<p>Overpopulation has substantially adversely impacted the environment of Earth starting at least as early as the 20th century. According to the Global Footprint Network, "today humanity uses the equivalent of 1.5 planets to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste". There are also economic consequences of this <a href="/wiki/Environmental_degradation" title="Environmental degradation">environmental degradation</a> in the form of <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> attrition. Beyond the scientifically verifiable harm to the environment, some assert the moral right of other species to simply exist rather than become extinct. Environmental author <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Rifkin" title="Jeremy Rifkin">Jeremy Rifkin</a> has said that "our burgeoning population and urban way of life have been purchased at the expense of vast ecosystems and habitats. ... It's no accident that as we celebrate the urbanization of the world, we are quickly approaching another historic watershed: the disappearance of the wild."</p>
<p>Says Peter Raven, former President of the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> (AAAS) in their seminal work <a class="external text" href="http://atlas.aaas.org/" rel="nofollow">AAAS Atlas of Population &amp; Environment</a>, "Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly, the past half century has been a traumatic one, as the collective impact of human numbers, affluence (consumption per individual) and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate. ... During a remarkably short period of time, we have lost a quarter of the world's <a href="/wiki/Topsoil" title="Topsoil">topsoil</a> and a fifth of its agricultural land, altered the composition of the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a> profoundly, and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural <a href="/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitats</a> without replacing them. Worst of all, we have driven the rate of biological <a href="/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinction</a>, the permanent loss of species, up several hundred times beyond its historical levels, and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century."</p>

<p>Further, even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems, it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems. However, as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized, pollution and consumption will invariably increase.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Worldwatch_Institute" title="Worldwatch Institute">Worldwatch Institute</a> said in 2006 that the booming economies of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">China</a> and India are "planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere". The report states:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said that if China and India were to consume as much resources per capita as the United States, in 2030 they would each require a full planet Earth to meet their needs. In the long term these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources and in the worst case a <a href="/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe" title="Malthusian catastrophe">Malthusian catastrophe</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Warfare_and_conflict">Warfare and conflict</span></h2>


<p>It has been suggested that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries. Modern usage of the term <a href="/wiki/Lebensraum#Modern_usage" title="Lebensraum">"lebensraum"</a> supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment (the <a href="/wiki/War#Youth_bulge" title="War">youth bulge theory</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism_of_this_hypothesis">Criticism of this hypothesis</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that population pressure causes increased <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Warfare" title="Warfare">warfare</a> has been recently criticized on the empirical grounds. Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. <a href="/wiki/Andrey_Korotayev" title="Andrey Korotayev">Andrey Korotayev</a>, in collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Peter_Turchin" title="Peter Turchin">Peter Turchin</a>, has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.</p>
<p>Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Han_Dynasty" title="Han Dynasty">Han</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang</a> China, and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).</p>
<p>Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mitigation_measures">Mitigation measures</span></h2>
<p>There are several mitigation measures that have been or can be applied to reduce overpopulation. All of these mitigations are ways to implement social norms. Overpopulation is an issue that threatens the state of the environment in the above-mentioned ways and therefore societies must make a change in order to reverse some of the environmental effects brought on by current social norms. In societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have already begun to implement social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. "The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands)."</p>
<p>Such prompts work to introduce the problem so that social norms are easier to implement. Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods. An example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is Afghanistan. "The approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of the Shia Personal Status Law in March 2009 effectively destroyed Shia women's rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. Under this law, women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill, and can be denied food if they do."</p>

<p>One option is to focus on education about overpopulation, <a href="/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning">family planning</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Birth_control" title="Birth control">birth control</a> methods, and to make birth-control devices like male and <a href="/wiki/Female_condom" title="Female condom">female</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Condoms" title="Condoms">condoms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill" title="Combined oral contraceptive pill">pills</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intrauterine_device" title="Intrauterine device">intrauterine devices</a> easily available. Worldwide, nearly 40% of <a href="/wiki/Unintended_pregnancy" title="Unintended pregnancy">pregnancies are unintended</a> (some 80 million unintended pregnancies each year). An estimated 350 million women in the poorest countries of the world either did not want their last child, do not want another child or want to space their pregnancies, but they lack access to information, affordable means and services to determine the size and spacing of their families. In the United States, in 2001, almost half of <a href="/wiki/Unintended_pregnancy" title="Unintended pregnancy">pregnancies were unintended</a>. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_world" title="Developing world">developing world</a>, some 514,000 women die annually of complications from pregnancy and abortion, with 86% of these deaths occurring in the <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> region and South Asia. Additionally, 8 million infants die, many because of <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a> or preventable diseases, especially from lack of access to clean drinking water.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Women%27s_rights" title="Women's rights">Women's rights</a> and their <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_rights" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a> in particular are issues regarded to have vital importance in the debate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only ray of hope I can see – and it's not much – is that wherever women are put in control of their lives, both politically and socially; where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions, birth rate falls. Women don't want to have 12 kids of whom nine will die." — <a href="/wiki/David_Attenborough" title="David Attenborough">David Attenborough</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting <a href="/wiki/Women_in_the_workforce" title="Women in the workforce">women in the workforce</a>. It was announced in June 2008 by the Minister of Health and Population <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Hatem_el-Gabali&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hatem el-Gabali (page does not exist)">Hatem el-Gabali</a>. The government has set aside 480 million Egyptian pounds (about $90 million US) for the program.</p>
<p>The business magnate <a href="/wiki/Ted_Turner" title="Ted Turner">Ted Turner</a> proposed a "voluntary, non-imposed" one-child family scenario. A "<a href="/wiki/Population_Matters#Pledge_two_or_fewer" title="Population Matters">pledge two or fewer</a>" campaign is run by <a href="/wiki/Population_Matters" title="Population Matters">Population Matters</a> (a UK population concern organisation), in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Birth_regulations">Birth regulations</span></h3>
<p>Overpopulation is related to the issue of <a href="/wiki/Birth_control" title="Birth control">birth control</a>; some nations, like the People's Republic of China, use strict measures to reduce birth rates. Religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sanjay_Gandhi" title="Sanjay Gandhi">Sanjay Gandhi</a>, son of late Prime Minister of India <a href="/wiki/Indira_Gandhi" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, implemented a forced <a href="/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization" title="Compulsory sterilization">sterilization</a> programme between 1975 and 1977. Officially, men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization, but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men. Some unmarried young men, political opponents and ignorant men were also believed to have been sterilized. This program is still remembered and criticized in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to <a href="/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning">family planning</a>, which hampered government programmes for decades.</p>
<p>Urban designer <a href="/wiki/Michael_E._Arth" title="Michael E. Arth">Michael E. Arth</a> has proposed a "choice-based, marketable birth license plan" he calls "<a href="/wiki/Birth_credit" title="Birth credit">birth credits</a>". Birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants, as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in <a href="/wiki/Zero_population_growth" title="Zero population growth">zero population growth</a>. If that allotment was determined to be one child, for example, then the first child would be free, and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost. Extra credits would expire after a certain time, so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators. The actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child" title="Cost of raising a child">cost of having and raising a child</a>, so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society.</p>

<p>Another choice-based approach, similar to Arth's birth credits, is financial compensation or other benefits (free goods and/or services) by the state (or state-owned companies) offered to people who voluntarily undergo <a href="/wiki/Sterilization_(medicine)" title="Sterilization (medicine)">sterilization</a>. Such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of India.</p>
<p>In 2014 the United Nations estimated there is an 80% likelihood that the world's population will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion by 2100. Most of the world's expected population increase will be in Africa and southern Asia. Africa's population is expected to rise from the current one billion to three or four billion by 2100, and Asia could add another billion in the same period. Because the median age of Africans is so low (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Uganda" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> = 15 years old) birth credits would have to limit fertility to one child per two women to reach the levels of developed countries immediately. For countries with a wide base in their population pyramid it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families. An example of <a href="/wiki/Demographic_momentum" title="Demographic momentum">demographic momentum</a> is China, which added perhaps 400,000 more people after its one-child policy was enacted. Arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Infectious_agents">Infectious agents</span></h3>
<p>There are also natural diseases, such as <a href="/wiki/Chlamydia_infection" title="Chlamydia infection">chlamydia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gonorrhea" title="Gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a> and even some diseases that produce no physical discomfort at all (such as some specific <a href="/wiki/Adeno-associated_virus" title="Adeno-associated virus">adeno-associated viruses</a>) that may also cause sterilization of males and/or females in the population. Whereas the natural occurrence of these diseases is not sufficient to significantly reduce the population problem, large-scale production of these diseases and human-induced release of such diseases could quite well be used as a mitigation measure.</p>

<p>Various scientists and <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> authors have contemplated that overpopulation on Earth may be remedied in the future by the use of extraterrestrial settlements. In the 1970s, <a href="/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill" title="Gerard K. O'Neill">Gerard K. O'Neill</a> suggested building <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_habitats" title="Space habitats">space habitats</a> that could support 30,000 times the carrying capacity of Earth using just the asteroid belt, and that the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years. <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Savage" title="Marshall Savage">Marshall Savage</a> (1992, 1994) has projected a human population of five <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers)#1018" title="Orders of magnitude (numbers)">quintillion</a> (5 x 10) throughout the Solar System by 3000, with the majority in the <a href="/wiki/Asteroid_belt" title="Asteroid belt">asteroid belt</a>. <a href="/wiki/Freeman_Dyson" title="Freeman Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a> (1999) favours the <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_belt" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a> as the future home of humanity, suggesting this could happen within a few centuries. In <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mining_the_Sky:_Untold_Riches_from_the_Asteroids,_Comets,_and_Planets" title="Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets">Mining the Sky</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/John_S._Lewis" title="John S. Lewis">John S. Lewis</a> suggests that the resources of the solar system could support 10 <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers)#1015" title="Orders of magnitude (numbers)">quadrillion</a> (10) people. In an interview, <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> claimed that overpopulation is a threat to human existence and "our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth but to spread out into space."</p>

<p>It may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future. <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_A._Landis" title="Geoffrey A. Landis">Geoffrey Landis</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration" title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Research_Center" title="Glenn Research Center">Glenn Research Center</a> in particular has pointed out that "[at] cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet", as one could construct <a href="/wiki/Aerostat" title="Aerostat">aerostat</a> habitats and <a href="/wiki/Floating_city_(science_fiction)" title="Floating city (science fiction)">floating cities</a> there easily, based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus" title="Atmosphere of Venus">Venusian atmosphere</a>. <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> would, like also <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uranus" title="Uranus">Uranus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>, in the upper layers of their atmospheres, even afford a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gravitation" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a> almost exactly as strong as <a href="/wiki/G-force" title="G-force">that on Earth</a> (<i>see</i> <a href="/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus" title="Colonization of Venus">colonization of Venus</a>).</p>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> authors, including <a href="/wiki/Carl_Sagan" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke" title="Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, have argued that shipping any excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation. According to Clarke, "the population battle must be fought or won here on Earth". The problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space (as shown in books such as <i>Mining the Sky</i>), but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to "solve" overpopulation on Earth. However, <a href="/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill" title="Gerard K. O'Neill">Gerard K. O'Neill</a>'s calculations show that Earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/StarTram" title="StarTram">StarTram</a> concept, by <a href="/wiki/James_R._Powell" title="James R. Powell">James R. Powell</a> (the co-inventor of <a href="/wiki/Maglev" title="Maglev">maglev</a> transport) and others, envisions a capability to send up to 4 million people a decade to space per facility. A hypothetical extraterrestrial colony could potentially grow by reproduction only (i.e., without any immigration), with all of the inhabitants being the direct descendants of the original colonists.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Urbanization">Urbanization</span></h3>
<p>Despite the increase in population density within cities (and the emergence of megacities), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Habitat" title="UN Habitat">UN Habitat</a> states in its reports that urbanization may be the best compromise in the face of global population growth. Cities concentrate human activity within limited areas, limiting the breadth of environmental damage. But this mitigating influence can only be achieved if <a href="/wiki/Urban_planning" title="Urban planning">urban planning</a> is significantly improved and city services are properly maintained.</p>
