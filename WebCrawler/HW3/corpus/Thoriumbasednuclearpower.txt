<p><b>Thorium-based nuclear power</b> is <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a>-based, fuelled primarily by the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Isotope" title="Isotope">isotope</a> <a href="/wiki/Uranium-233" title="Uranium-233">uranium-233</a> produced from the <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile</a> element <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>. According to proponents, a <a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle" title="Thorium fuel cycle">thorium fuel cycle</a> offers several potential advantages over a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uranium_fuel_cycle" title="Uranium fuel cycle">uranium fuel cycle</a>—including much <a href="/wiki/Thorium#Occurrence" title="Thorium">greater abundance</a> on Earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. However, development of thorium power has significant start-up costs. Proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium, while critics say that development of <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeder reactors</a> in general (including thorium reactors, which are breeders by nature) increases proliferation concerns. Since about 2008, nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuel</a> in place of <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> to generate <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>.

<p>A nuclear reactor consumes certain specific <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">fissile</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isotopes" title="Isotopes">isotopes</a> to produce energy. The three most practical types of nuclear reactor fuel are:</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">Uranium-235</a>, purified (i.e. "<a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">enriched</a>") by reducing the amount of <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">uranium-238</a> in natural mined uranium. Most nuclear power has been generated using low-enriched uranium (LEU), whereas high-enriched uranium (HEU) is necessary for weapons.</li>

</ul>
<p>Some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner, safer nuclear power. According to an opinion piece by a group of scientists at the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology" title="Georgia Institute of Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, considering its overall potential, thorium-based power "can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative environmental impact."</p>
<p>After studying the feasibility of using thorium, nuclear scientists Ralph W. Moir and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Teller" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a> suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built. Research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors, primarily the <a href="/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor" title="Liquid fluoride thorium reactor">liquid fluoride thorium reactor</a> (LFTR), a <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">molten salt reactor</a> (MSR) design, has been or is now being done in India, China, Norway, the United States, Israel and Russia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background_and_brief_history">Background and brief history</span></h2>

<p>After World War II, uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity. These were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons. During that period, the government of the United States also built <a href="/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment" title="Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment">an experimental molten salt reactor</a> using U-233 fuel, the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons. The MSRE reactor, built at <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, operated <a href="/wiki/Critical_mass" title="Critical mass">critical</a> for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969. In 1968, Nobel laureate and discoverer of <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">Plutonium</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glenn_Seaborg" title="Glenn Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a>, publicly announced to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="United States Atomic Energy Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a>, of which he was chairman, that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested:</p>
<p>In 1973, however, the US government shut down all thorium-related nuclear research—which had by then been ongoing for approximately twenty years at <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>. The reasons were that uranium breeder reactors were more efficient, the research was proven, and byproducts could be used to make nuclear weapons. In Moir and Teller’s opinion, the decision to stop development of thorium reactors, at least as a backup option, “was an excusable mistake.”</p>
<p>Science writer Richard Martin states that nuclear physicist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alvin_Weinberg" title="Alvin Weinberg">Alvin Weinberg</a>, who was director at Oak Ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor, lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors. Weinberg himself recalls this period:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>[Congressman] <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chet_Holifield" title="Chet Holifield">Chet Holifield</a> was clearly exasperated with me, and he finally blurted out, "Alvin, if you are concerned about the safety of reactors, then I think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy." I was speechless. But it was apparent to me that my style, my attitude, and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the AEC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin explains that Weinberg's unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor, one that would have zero risk of meltdown. . . . his team built a working reactor . . . . and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nation’s atomic power effort. He failed. Uranium reactors had already been established, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyman_Rickover" title="Hyman Rickover">Hyman Rickover</a>, de facto head of the US nuclear program, wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs. Increasingly shunted aside, Weinberg was finally forced out in 1973.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power, many of today’s nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it. According to <i><a href="/wiki/Chemical_%26_Engineering_News" title="Chemical &amp; Engineering News">Chemical &amp; Engineering News</a></i>, "most people—including scientists—have hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it...," noting a comment by a conference attendee that "it's possible to have a Ph.D. in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy." Nuclear physicist <a href="/wiki/Victor_J._Stenger" title="Victor J. Stenger">Victor J. Stenger</a>, for one, first learned of it in 2012:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>It came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since World War II, but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others, including former <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> scientist and thorium expert <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kirk_Sorensen" title="Kirk Sorensen">Kirk Sorensen</a>, agree that "thorium was the alternative path that was not taken … " According to Sorensen, during a documentary interview, he states that if the US had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have "probably achieved energy independence by around 2000."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Possible_benefits">Possible benefits</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Nuclear_Association" title="World Nuclear Association">World Nuclear Association</a> explains some of the possible benefits</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The thorium fuel cycle offers enormous energy security benefits in the long-term – due to its potential for being a self-sustaining fuel without the need for fast neutron reactors. It is therefore an important and potentially viable technology that seems able to contribute to building credible, long-term nuclear energy scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moir and Teller agree, noting that the possible advantages of thorium include "utilization of an abundant fuel, inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use, together with good economics and safety features … " Thorium is considered the "most abundant, most readily available, cleanest, and safest energy source on Earth," adds science writer Richard Martin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thorium is three times as abundant as uranium and nearly as abundant as lead and gallium in the Earth's crust. The <a href="/wiki/Thorium_Energy_Alliance" title="Thorium Energy Alliance">Thorium Energy Alliance</a> estimates "there is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years." "America has buried tons as a by-product of rare earth metals mining," notes Evans-Pritchard. Almost all thorium is <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile</a> Th-232, compared to uranium that is composed of 99.3% fertile U-238 and 0.7% more valuable fissile U-235.</li>
<li>It is difficult to make a practical nuclear bomb from a thorium reactor's byproducts. According to <a href="/wiki/Alvin_Radkowsky" title="Alvin Radkowsky">Alvin Radkowsky</a>, designer of the world's first full-scale atomic electric power plant, "a thorium reactor's plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor, and the plutonium's isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation." Several uranium-233 bombs have been tested, but the presence of <a href="/wiki/Uranium-232" title="Uranium-232">uranium-232</a> tended to "poison" the uranium-233 in two ways: <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">intense radiation</a> from the uranium-232 made the material difficult to handle, and the uranium-233 led to possible pre-detonation. Separating the uranium-232 from the uranium-233 proved very difficult, although newer <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a> techniques could facilitate that process.</li>
<li>There is much less nuclear waste—up to two orders of magnitude less, states Moir and Teller, eliminating the need for large-scale or long-term storage; "Chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium." The radioactivity of the resulting waste also drops down to safe levels after just a few hundred years, compared to tens of thousands of years needed for current nuclear waste to cool off.</li>
<li>According to Moir and Teller, "once started up [it] needs no other fuel except thorium because it makes most or all of its own fuel." This only applies to breeding reactors, that produce at least as much fissile material as they consume. Other reactors require additional fissile material, such as uranium-235 or plutonium.</li>
<li>Thorium fuel cycle is a potential way to produce long term nuclear energy with low radio-toxicity waste. In addition, the transition to thorium could be done through the incineration of weapons grade plutonium (WPu) or civilian plutonium.</li>
<li>Since all natural thorium can be used as fuel no expensive fuel enrichment is needed. However the same is true for U-238 as fertile fuel in the uranium-plutonium cycle.</li>
<li>Comparing the amount of thorium needed with coal, Nobel laureate <a href="/wiki/Carlo_Rubbia" title="Carlo Rubbia">Carlo Rubbia</a> of <a href="/wiki/CERN" title="CERN">CERN</a>, (European Organization for Nuclear Research), estimates that one ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium, or 3,500,000 tons of coal. Coal, makes up 42% of US electrical power generation and 65% in China.</li>
<li>Liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof. A plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit, draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage.</li>
<li>Mining thorium is safer and more efficient than mining uranium. Thorium's ore monazite generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore. This makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source. Thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining, as the mine is an open pit which requires no ventilation, unlike underground uranium mines, where <a href="/wiki/Radon" title="Radon">radon</a> levels can be potentially harmful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summarizing some of the potential benefits, Martin offers his general opinion: "Thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concern—weapons proliferation, radioactive pollution, toxic waste, and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process. From an economics viewpoint, UK business editor <a href="/wiki/Ambrose_Evans-Pritchard" title="Ambrose Evans-Pritchard">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard</a> has suggested that "Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium," suggesting a "new <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Project" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>," and adding, "If it works, Manhattan II could restore American optimism and strategic leadership at a stroke …" Moir and Teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be "well under $1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of $100 million per year," and as a result a "large-scale nuclear power plan" usable by many countries could be set up within a decade.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Possible_disadvantages">Possible disadvantages</span></h2>
<p>Some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breeding in a thermal neutron spectrum is slow and requires extensive <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">reprocessing</a>. The feasibility of reprocessing is still open.</li>
<li>Significant and expensive testing, analysis and licensing work is first required, requiring business and government support. According to a 2012 report by the <a href="/wiki/Bulletin_of_the_Atomic_Scientists" title="Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a>, about using thorium fuel with existing water-cooled reactors, it would "require too great an investment and provide no clear payoff," noting that "from the utilities’ point of view, the only legitimate driver capable of motivating pursuit of thorium is economics."</li>
<li>There is a higher cost of fuel fabrication and reprocessing than in plants using traditional solid fuel rods.</li>
<li>Thorium, when being irradiated for use in reactors, will make uranium-232, which is very dangerous due to the gamma rays it emits. This irradiation process may be altered slightly by removing protactinium-233. The irradiation would then make uranium-233 in lieu of uranium-232, which can be used in nuclear weapons to make thorium into a dual purpose fuel.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/CANDU_reactor" title="CANDU reactor">CANDU reactors</a> are capable of using thorium, and Thorium Power Canada has, in 2013, planned and proposed developing thorium power projects for Chile and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The proposed 10 MW demonstration reactor in <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a> could be used to power a 20 million litre/day <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Desalination_plant" title="Desalination plant">desalination plant</a>. All land and regulatory approvals are currently in process.</p>
<p>Thorium Power Canada's proposal for the development of a 25 MW <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a> reactor in <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> is meant to be a "demonstration power project" which could provide electrical power to the country’s power grid.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="China">China</span></h3>
<p>At the 2011 annual conference of the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, it was announced that "China has initiated a research and development project in thorium <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">MSR</a> technology." In addition, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Jiang_Mianheng" title="Jiang Mianheng">Jiang Mianheng</a>, son of China's former leader <a href="/wiki/Jiang_Zemin" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, led a thorium delegation in non-disclosure talks at <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, Tennessee, and by late 2013 China had officially partnered with Oak Ridge to aid China in its own development. The <a href="/wiki/World_Nuclear_Association" title="World Nuclear Association">World Nuclear Association</a> notes that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/China_Academy_of_Sciences" title="China Academy of Sciences">China Academy of Sciences</a> in January 2011 announced its R&amp;D program, "claiming to have the world's largest national effort on it, hoping to obtain full <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> rights on the technology." According to Martin, "China has made clear its intention to go it alone," adding that China already has a monopoly over most of the world's <a href="/wiki/Rare_earth_mineral" title="Rare earth mineral">rare earth minerals</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2014, with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current "smog crisis," they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10. "In the past, the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage. Now they are more interested because of smog," said Professor Li Zhong, a scientist working on the project. "This is definitely a race," he added.</p>
<p>In early 2012, it was reported that China, using components produced by the West and Russia, planned to build two prototype thorium <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">MSRs</a> by 2015, and had budgeted the project at $400 million and requiring 400 workers." China also finalized an agreement with a Canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CANDU" title="CANDU">CANDU</a> reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Germany">Germany</span></h3>
<p>The German <a href="/wiki/THTR-300" title="THTR-300">THTR-300</a> was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched U-235 as fissile fuel. Though named thorium high temperature reactor, mostly U-235 was fissioned. The THTR-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a <a href="/wiki/Pebble-bed_reactor" title="Pebble-bed reactor">pebble-bed reactor</a> core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix. It fed power to Germany's grid for 432 days in the late 1980s, before it was shut down for cost, mechanical and other reasons.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="India">India</span></h3>
<p>India has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world, with comparatively poor quantities of uranium. India has projected meeting as much as 30% of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050.</p>
<p>In February 2014, <a href="/wiki/Bhabha_Atomic_Research_Centre" title="Bhabha Atomic Research Centre">Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</a> (BARC), in Mumbai, India, presented their latest design for a "next-generation nuclear reactor" that will burn thorium as its fuel ore. Once built, with a target date of 2016, they estimate that the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days.</p>
<p>According to Dr R K Sinha, chairman of their Atomic Energy Commission, "This will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, mostly imported, and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change." Because of its inherent safety, they expect that similar designs could be set up "within" populated cities, like Mumbai or Delhi.</p>
<p>India's government is also developing up to 62, mostly thorium reactors, which it expects to be operational by 2025. It is the "only country in the world with a detailed, funded, government-approved plan" to focus on thorium-based nuclear power. The country currently gets under 2% of its electricity from nuclear power, with the rest coming from coal (60%), hydroelectricity (16%), other renewable sources (12%) and natural gas (9%). It expects to produce around 25% of its electricity from nuclear power. In 2009 the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission said that India has a "long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources."</p>
<p>In late June 2012, India announced that their "first commercial fast reactor" was near completion making India the most advanced country in thorium research." We have huge reserves of thorium. The challenge is to develop technology for converting this to fissile material," stated their former Chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission. That vision of using thorium in place of uranium was set out in the 1950s by physicist <a href="/wiki/Homi_J._Bhabha" title="Homi J. Bhabha">Homi Bhabha</a>. India's first commercial fast breeder reactor — the 500 MWe <a href="/wiki/Prototype_Fast_Breeder_Reactor" title="Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor">Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor</a> (PFBR) — is approaching completion at the <a href="/wiki/Indira_Gandhi_Centre_for_Atomic_Research" title="Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research">Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kalpakkam" title="Kalpakkam">Kalpakkam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>.</p>
<p>As of July 2013 the major equipment of the PFBR had been erected and the loading of "dummy" fuels in peripheral locations was in progress. The reactor was expected to go critical by September 2014. The Centre had sanctioned Rs. 5,677 <a href="/wiki/Crore" title="Crore">crore</a> for building the PFBR and “we will definitely build the reactor within that amount,” Mr. Kumar asserted. The original cost of the project was Rs. 3,492 crore, revised to Rs. 5,677 crore. Electricity generated from the PFBR would be sold to the State Electricity Boards at Rs. 4.44 a unit. BHAVINI builds <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeder reactors</a> in India.</p>
<p>India's 300 MWe <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AHWR" title="AHWR">AHWR</a> (pressurized heavy water reactor) began construction in 2011. The design envisages a start up with reactor grade plutonium that will breed U-233 from Th-232. Thereafter thorium is to be the only fuel.</p>
<p>By Nov 2015 the PFBR was built and expected to Delays have since postponed the commissioning [criticality?] of the PFBR to Sept 2016, but India's commitment to long-term nuclear energy production is underscored by the approval in 2015 of ten new sites for reactors of unspecified types, though procurement of primary fissile material – preferably plutonium – may be problematic due to India's low uranium reserves and capacity for production.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Israel">Israel</span></h3>

However, in 2010, the UK’s <a href="/wiki/National_Nuclear_Laboratory" title="National Nuclear Laboratory">National Nuclear Laboratory</a> (NNL) concluded that for the short to medium term, "...the thorium fuel cycle does not currently have a role to play," in that it is "technically immature, and would require a significant financial investment and risk without clear benefits," and concluded that the benefits have been "overstated." <a href="/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth" title="Friends of the Earth">Friends of the Earth</a> UK considers research into it as "useful" as a fallback option.</p>

In 1992, while a resident professor in <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, Israel, he founded the US company, Thorium Power Ltd., near Washington, D.C., to build thorium reactors.</p>
<p>The primary fuel of the proposed <a href="/wiki/HT3R" title="HT3R">HTR</a> research project near <a href="/wiki/Odessa,_Texas" title="Odessa, Texas">Odessa, Texas</a>, United States, will be ceramic-coated thorium beads. The earliest the reactor would become operational was 2015.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="World_sources_of_thorium">World sources of thorium</span></h2>

<p>Thorium is mostly found with the <a href="/wiki/Rare_earth_element" title="Rare earth element">rare earth</a> phosphate mineral, <a href="/wiki/Monazite" title="Monazite">monazite</a>, which contains up to about 12% thorium phosphate, but 6-7% on average. World monazite resources are estimated to be about 12 million tons, two-thirds of which are in heavy mineral sands deposits on the south and east coasts of India. There are substantial deposits in several other countries <i>(see table "World thorium reserves")</i>.</p>
<p>Another estimate of reasonably assured reserves (RAR) and estimated additional reserves (EAR) of thorium comes from OECD/NEA, Nuclear Energy, "Trends in Nuclear Fuel Cycle", Paris, France (2001). <i>(see table "IAEA Estimates in tons")</i></p>

<p>The preceding figures are reserves and as such refer to the amount of thorium in high-concentration deposits inventoried so far and estimated to be extractable at current market prices; millions of times more total exist in Earth's 3<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 tonne crust, around 120 trillion tons of thorium, and lesser but vast quantities of thorium exist at intermediate concentrations. Proved reserves are a good indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/World_Nuclear_Association" title="World Nuclear Association">World Nuclear Association</a>, there are seven types of reactors that can be designed to use thorium as a nuclear fuel. The first five of these have all entered into operational service at some point. The last two are still conceptual, although currently in development by many countries:</p>
