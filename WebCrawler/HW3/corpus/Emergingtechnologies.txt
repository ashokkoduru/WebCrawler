<p><b>Emerging technologies</b> are technologies that are perceived as capable of changing the status quo. These technologies are generally new but include older technologies that are still controversial and relatively undeveloped in potential, such as <a href="/wiki/3D_printing" title="3D printing">3D printing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis" title="Preimplantation genetic diagnosis">preimplantation genetic diagnosis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gene_therapy" title="Gene therapy">gene therapy</a> which date to 1981, 1989 and 1990 respectively.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty, relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous.".</p>
<p>Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as <a href="/wiki/Educational_technology" title="Educational technology">educational technology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">information technology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_science" title="Cognitive science">cognitive science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychotechnology" title="Psychotechnology">psychotechnology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robotics" title="Robotics">robotics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>New technological fields may result from the <a href="/wiki/Technological_convergence" title="Technological convergence">technological convergence</a> of different systems evolving towards similar goals. Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic_competition" title="Economic competition">competitive advantage</a>; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies vary.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/History_of_technology" title="History of technology">history of technology</a>, emerging technologies are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Over centuries, innovative methods and new technologies are developed and opened up. Some of these technologies are due to theoretical research, and others from commercial <a href="/wiki/Research_and_development" title="Research and development">research and development</a>.</p>
<p>Technological growth includes incremental developments and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disruptive_technology" title="Disruptive technology">disruptive technologies</a>. An example of the former was the gradual roll-out of <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> (digital video disc) as a development intended to follow on from the previous optical technology <a href="/wiki/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">compact disc</a>. By contrast, disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous technology and makes it redundant, for example, the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by automobiles.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Technology_and_society" title="Technology and society">Technology and society</a></div>
<p>Many writers, including <a href="/wiki/Computer_scientist" title="Computer scientist">computer scientist</a> <a href="/wiki/Bill_Joy" title="Bill Joy">Bill Joy</a>, have identified clusters of technologies that they consider critical to humanity's future. Joy warns that the technology could be used by elites for <a href="/wiki/Good_and_evil" title="Good and evil">good</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Evil" title="Evil">evil</a>. They could use it as "good shepherds" for the rest of humanity, or decide everyone else is superfluous and push for mass extinction of those made unnecessary by technology.</p>
<p>Advocates of the benefits of <a href="/wiki/Technological_change" title="Technological change">technological change</a> typically see emerging and converging technologies as offering hope for the betterment of the <a href="/wiki/Human_condition" title="Human condition">human condition</a>. Cyberphilosophers <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Bard" title="Alexander Bard">Alexander Bard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jan_S%C3%B6derqvist" title="Jan Söderqvist">Jan Söderqvist</a> argue in <i>The Futurica Trilogy</i> that while Man himself is basically constant throughout human history (<a href="/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genes</a> change very slowly), all relevant change is rather a direct or indirect result of technological innovation (<a href="/wiki/Memetics" title="Memetics">memes</a> change very fast) since new ideas always emanate from technology use and not the other way around. Man should consequently be regarded as history's main constant and technology as its main variable. However, critics of the risks of technological change, and even some advocates such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transhumanist" title="Transhumanist">transhumanist</a> philosopher <a href="/wiki/Nick_Bostrom" title="Nick Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a>, warn that some of these technologies could pose dangers, perhaps even contribute to the <a href="/wiki/Human_extinction" title="Human extinction">extinction of humanity</a> itself; i.e., some of them could involve <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Existential_risk" title="Existential risk">existential risks</a>.</p>
<p>Much <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_technology" title="Ethics of technology">ethical debate</a> centers on issues of <a href="/wiki/Distributive_justice" title="Distributive justice">distributive justice</a> in allocating access to beneficial forms of technology. Some thinkers, such as <a href="/wiki/Environmental_ethics" title="Environmental ethics">environmental ethicist</a> <a href="/wiki/Bill_McKibben" title="Bill McKibben">Bill McKibben</a>, oppose the continuing development of advanced technology partly out of fear that its benefits will be distributed unequally in ways that could worsen the <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">plight of the poor</a>. By contrast, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inventor" title="Inventor">inventor</a> <a href="/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" title="Ray Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> is among <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Techno-utopianism" title="Techno-utopianism">techno-utopians</a> who believe that emerging and converging technologies could and will <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_scarcity" title="Post scarcity">eliminate poverty</a> and abolish suffering.</p>
<p>Some analysts such as Martin Ford, author of <i>The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future</i>, argue that as information technology advances, robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant <a href="/wiki/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> as machines and software begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine jobs.</p>
<p>As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further, even many skilled jobs may be threatened. Technologies such as machine learning may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledge-based jobs that require significant education. This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels, stagnant or falling wages for most workers, and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever larger fraction of the economy. This in turn could lead to depressed consumer spending and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy.</p>

In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on <i>in vitro</i> meat in the laboratory. The <a href="#First_public_trial">first in vitro beefburger</a>, created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013. There remain difficulties to be overcome before <i>in vitro</i> meat becomes commercially available. Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves. <i>In vitro</i> meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Development_of_emerging_technologies">Development of emerging technologies</span></h2>
<p>As innovation drives economic growth, and large economic rewards come from new inventions, a great deal of resources (funding and effort) go into the development of emerging technologies. Some of the sources of these resources are described below...</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Research_and_development">Research and development</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Research_and_development" title="Research and development">Research and development</a> is directed towards the advancement of technology in general, and therefore includes development of emerging technologies. <i>See also <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending" title="List of countries by research and development spending">List of countries by research and development spending</a>.</i></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Applied_research" title="Applied research">Applied research</a> is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science.

<p><a href="/wiki/Science_policy" title="Science policy">Science policy</a> is the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science and research enterprise, including the funding of science, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="DARPA">DARPA</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</a> is an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.</p>
<p>DARPA was created in 1958 as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements.</p>
<p>Projects funded by DARPA have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as computer networking and graphical user interfaces in information technology.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Technology_competitions_and_awards">Technology competitions and awards</span></h3>
<p>There are awards that provide incentive to push the limits of technology (generally synonymous with emerging technologies). Note that while some of these awards reward achievement after-the-fact via analysis of the merits of technological breakthroughs, others provide incentive via competitions for awards offered for goals yet to be achieved.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Orteig_Prize" title="Orteig Prize">Orteig Prize</a> was a $25,000 award offered in 1919 by French hotelier <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Orteig" title="Raymond Orteig">Raymond Orteig</a> for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris. In 1927, underdog <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the <a href="/wiki/Spirit_of_St._Louis" title="Spirit of St. Louis">Spirit of St. Louis</a>. In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.</p>
<p>The XPRIZE series of awards, public competitions designed and managed by the non-profit organization called the <a href="/wiki/X_Prize_Foundation" title="X Prize Foundation">X Prize Foundation</a>, are intended to encourage technological development that could benefit mankind. The most high-profile XPRIZE to date was the $10,000,000 Ansari XPRIZE relating to spacecraft development, which was awarded in 2004 for the development of <a href="/wiki/SpaceShipOne" title="SpaceShipOne">SpaceShipOne</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Turing_Award" title="Turing Award">Turing Award</a> is an annual prize given by the <a href="/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery" title="Association for Computing Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM) to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community". It is stipulated that "The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field". The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, and in 2014 grew to $1,000,000.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Technology_Prize" title="Millennium Technology Prize">Millennium Technology Prize</a> is awarded once every two years by <a href="/wiki/Technology_Academy_Finland" title="Technology Academy Finland">Technology Academy Finland</a>, an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the Finnish state in partnership. The first recipient was <a href="/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, inventor of the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, <a href="/wiki/David_Gobel" title="David Gobel">David Gobel</a> seed-funded the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methuselah_Mouse_Prize" title="Methuselah Mouse Prize">Methuselah Mouse Prize</a> (Mprize) to encourage the development of new life extension therapies in mice, which are genetically similar to humans.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Role_of_science_fiction">Role of science fiction</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">Science fiction</a> has criticized developing and future technologies, but also inspires <a href="/wiki/Innovation" title="Innovation">innovation</a> and new technology. This topic has been more often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums. Cinema and media theorist <a href="/wiki/Vivian_Sobchack" title="Vivian Sobchack">Vivian Sobchack</a> examines the dialogue between science fiction films and technological imagination.
