<p>A <b>nation</b> (from <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>: <i>natio</i>, "people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock") is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them - including <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tradition" title="Tradition">traditions</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Mores" title="Mores">mores</a></i> (customs), <a href="/wiki/Habitus_(sociology)" title="Habitus (sociology)"><i>habitus</i></a> (habits), and <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_group" title="Ethnic group">ethnicity</a>. By comparison, a nation is more impersonal, abstract, and overtly political than an <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_group" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a>. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin's</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Marxism_and_the_National_Question" title="Marxism and the National Question">Marxism and the National Question</a></i> (1913) declares that "a nation is not a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Race_(human_classification)" title="Race (human classification)">racial</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tribe" title="Tribe">tribal</a>, but a historically constituted <a href="/wiki/Community" title="Community">community</a> of people;" "a nation is not a casual or ephemeral <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conglomeration" title="wiktionary:conglomeration">conglomeration</a>, but a stable community of people"; "a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic <a href="/wiki/Interpersonal_communication" title="Interpersonal communication">intercourse</a>, as a result of people living together generation after generation"; and, in its entirety: "a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">culture</a>." </p>
<p>The nation has been described by <a href="/wiki/Benedict_Anderson" title="Benedict Anderson">Benedict Anderson</a> as an "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Imagined_communities" title="Imagined communities">imagined community</a>" and by <a href="/wiki/Paul_James_(academic)" title="Paul James (academic)">Paul James</a> as an "abstract community". It is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections. It is an abstract community in the sense that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will never likely meet. Hence the phrase, "a nation of strangers" used by such writers as <a href="/wiki/Vance_Packard" title="Vance Packard">Vance Packard</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology_and_terminology">Etymology and terminology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>nation</i> came to English from the <a href="/wiki/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> word <i>nacion</i> - meaning "birth" (<i>naissance</i>), "place of origin" -, which in turn originates from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> word <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/natio" title="wikt:Special:Search/natio">natio</a></i> (<i>nātĭō</i>) literally meaning "birth".</p>
<p>The word "nation" is sometimes used as synonym for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">State (polity)</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">sovereign state</a>: a government which controls a specific territory, which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Country" title="Country">Country</a>: a geographic territory, which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the phrase "nations of the world" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.</p>
<p>Depending on the meaning of "nation" used, the term "<a href="/wiki/Nation_state" title="Nation state">nation state</a>" could be used to distinguish larger states from small <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/City_state" title="City state">city states</a>, or could be used to distinguish <a href="/wiki/Multinational_state" title="Multinational state">multinational states</a> from those with a single ethnic group.</p>

<p>Although some scholars of <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> argue that nations are a modern phenomenon arising around the time of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, other scholars assert that nations are an old, or even an ancient, type of political formation. Political scientist <a href="/wiki/Azar_Gat" title="Azar Gat">Azar Gat</a> argues that ancient Egypt was the world's "first national state," emerging "quite early as a unified state, congruent with a distinct people of shared ethnicity."</p>
<p>Gat goes on to argue that the next group of national states to emerge were in the ancient Levant, citing <a href="/wiki/Steven_Grosby" title="Steven Grosby">Steven Grosby</a>'s book, <i>Biblical Ideas of Nationality: Ancient and Modern</i>, as an effective demonstration of the emergence of nations in <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" title="Land of Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammon" title="Ammon">Ammon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moab" title="Moab">Moab</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Edom" title="Edom">Edom</a>, a process of nation-formation provoked by the threat of conquest by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Assyrian_Empire" title="Assyrian Empire">Assyrian Empire</a>. In particular, Gat cites <a href="/wiki/Hans_Kohn" title="Hans Kohn">Hans Kohn</a>'s <i>The Idea of Nationalism: A Study in Its Origins and Background</i>, 1944, pp. 27–30 as an early scholarly treatment of "the idea that ancient Israel was an example of a premodern nation."</p>
<p>In his book, <i>The Athenian Nation</i> Edward E. Cohen, argues that ancient Athens met all modern definitions of nationhood, and <a href="/wiki/Aviel_Roshwald" title="Aviel Roshwald">Aviel Roshwald</a> makes a similar argument in <i>The Endurance of Nationalism: Ancient Roots and Modern Dilemmas</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Medieval_nations">Medieval nations</span></h2>
<p>In her book <i>Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900-1300</i>, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Reynolds" title="Susan Reynolds">Susan Reynolds</a> argues that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class. In his book <i>The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism</i>, <a href="/wiki/Adrian_Hastings" title="Adrian Hastings">Adrian Hastings</a> argues that England's Anglo Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. Hastings argues that <a href="/wiki/Alfred_the_Great" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>, in particular, drew on <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Biblical_nationalism&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Biblical nationalism (page does not exist)">biblical nationalism</a>, using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norman_conquest" title="Norman conquest">Norman conquest</a>) beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Wycliffe%27s_Bible" title="Wycliffe's Bible">translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s</a>, arguing that <a href="/wiki/English_nationalism" title="English nationalism">English nationalism</a> and the English nation have been continuous since that time.</p>
<p>Another prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath" title="Declaration of Arbroath">Declaration of Arbroath</a>, a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_Wars_of_Independence" title="Scottish Wars of Independence">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of <a href="/wiki/Robert_the_Bruce" title="Robert the Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bannockburn" title="Battle of Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a> was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both <a href="/wiki/Scottish_nationalism" title="Scottish nationalism">Scottish nationalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Popular_sovereignty" title="Popular sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Kaldellis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Anthony Kaldellis (page does not exist)">Anthony Kaldellis</a> affirms in <i>Hellenism in Byzantium</i> (2008) that what is called the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> was the Roman Empire transformed into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nation-state" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a> in Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Azar Gat is among the scholars who argue that <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.</p>

<p>A significant early use of the term <i>nation</i>, as <i>natio</i>, occurred at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mediaeval_university" title="Mediaeval university">mediaeval universities</a> to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Paris" title="University of Paris">University of Paris</a>, who were all born within a <i>pays</i>, spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law.

The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charles_University_in_Prague" title="Charles University in Prague">University of Prague</a> adopted the division of students into <i>nationes</i>: from its opening in 1349 the <i><a href="/wiki/Studium_generale" title="Studium generale">studium generale</a></i> which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian <i>nations</i>.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the <i>nationes</i> were segregated by the <a href="/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller" title="Knights Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem</a>, who maintained at <a href="/wiki/Rhodes" title="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> the hostels from which they took their name "where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion", as the Spanish traveller <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Tafur" title="Pedro Tafur">Pedro Tafur</a> noted in 1436.</p>

In a 2013 article "Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states", <a href="/wiki/Diana_Muir" title="Diana Muir">Diana Muir Appelbaum</a> expands Gorski's argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_science">Social science</span></h2>
<p>In the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civic_nation" title="Civic nation">civic nation</a> of which France was the principal example and the <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism" title="Ethnic nationalism">ethnic nation</a> exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like <a href="/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte" title="Johann Gottlieb Fichte">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a>, and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethnic_origins" title="Ethnic origins">ethnic origins</a>, that differentiate them from people of other nations. On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to "live together", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation. This is the vision, among others, of <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Renan" title="Ernest Renan">Ernest Renan</a>.</p>
<p>Present day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of <a href="/wiki/National_identity" title="National identity">national identity</a> sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/African_diaspora" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a></div>
<p>The 18th century brought an alteration to the meaning of the term "nation", which became more narrowly referred to as a group with a recognizable and sovereign government with physical borders. This new definition aligns more with the concept of a nation-state. The nation began to emerge in the late 18th century as the leading form of government and social organization. In the Americas, the catalyst that brought about this change in meaning was the influence of the African diaspora and its people in other states. National identity brought rights to vote, to hold office, and independence for a growing number of black territories held under colonial rule.</p>
<p>This change occurred in the New World as Africans were brought as enslaved peoples. The white population of the New World considered these aliens to be in one category of nation that was based entirely on color and continent of origin. The identity of the enslaved at the time was then shaped by their skin color rather than what nation or tribe they truly originated from. Prior to the 18th and 19th centuries, the term mainly referred to a group of people unified by language, region and cultural background; what is now considered to be one's ethnicity. It was through the process of emancipation and the end of the slave trade that the concept of nation began to change. As the previously enslaved began to fight for rights they had to discover what kind of rights they were searching for. It was in this process of emancipation that nationality began to take on a different meaning. Language and cultural background were no longer the only requirements of nation. Instead, now the idea of an established government and physical boundaries also shaped what it meant to be a nation.</p>
<p>However, within the diaspora, particularly among groups that have been politicized, the term <i>nation</i> has been used to describe a more abstract national experience, one that transcends physical borders and language differences. This description of nation is pinned to the shared experience of being radicalized and termed as Black. The expansion of <a href="/wiki/Black_nationalism" title="Black nationalism">Black nationalism</a> demonstrates that although some expanded the view that nation requires definable boundaries, those who shared the experience of the diaspora also found a nationality among themselves.</p>
