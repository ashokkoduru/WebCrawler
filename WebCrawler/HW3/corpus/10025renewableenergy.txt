<p>The incentive to use 100% <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> for electricity, heating and cooling and transport is motivated by <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, pollution and other ecological as well as economic and <a href="/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy security</a> concerns. Shifting the total global <a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a> supply to renewable sources requires a <a href="/wiki/Energy_transition" title="Energy transition">transition of the energy system</a>. In 2013 the <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization" title="Renewable energy commercialization">Renewable energy use</a> has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.</p>
<p>In 2014 renewables such as <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_energy" title="Geothermal energy">geothermal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bioenergy" title="Bioenergy">biomass</a> and burnt waste provided 19% of the total world final energy consumption, roughly half of it traditional use of biomass. The most important sector electricity with a renewable share of 22.8%, most of it coming from water power with a share of 16.6%, followed by wind with 3.1%. Several places run their grids almost exclusively on renewable energy. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and <a href="/wiki/Robert_H._Socolow" title="Robert H. Socolow">Robert H. Socolow</a> have developed a series of “<a href="/wiki/Climate_stabilization_wedge" title="Climate stabilization wedge">Climate stabilization wedges</a>” that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Mark_Z._Jacobson" title="Mark Z. Jacobson">Mark Z. Jacobson</a>, professor of civil and environmental engineering at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a> by 2030 is feasible and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source" title="Cost of electricity by source">energy costs</a> today with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies. The main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the United States, the independent <a href="/wiki/National_Research_Council_(United_States)" title="National Research Council (United States)">National Research Council</a> has noted that “sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, <a href="/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy security</a>, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."</p>
<p>The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political rather than technological. According to the 2013 <i>Post Carbon Pathways</i> report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_denial" title="Climate change denial">climate change denial</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby" title="Fossil fuels lobby">fossil fuels lobby</a>, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a <a href="/wiki/Science_(journal)" title="Science (journal)">Science</a> paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist <a href="/wiki/Bent_S%C3%B8rensen_(physicist)" title="Bent Sørensen (physicist)">Bent Sørensen</a>, which was followed by several other proposals. In 1976 <a href="/wiki/Energy_policy" title="Energy policy">energy policy</a> analyst <a href="/wiki/Amory_Lovins" title="Amory Lovins">Amory Lovins</a> coined the term "<a href="/wiki/Soft_energy_path" title="Soft energy path">soft energy path</a>" to describe an alternative future where <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> and appropriate <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels.</p>
<p>In 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europa and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor <a href="/wiki/Henrik_Lund_(academic)" title="Henrik Lund (academic)">Henrik Lund</a> published a first paper in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the <a href="/wiki/Energy_transition" title="Energy transition">transition</a> to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europa, America, Australia and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Even in the early 2000s it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity. However, renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_photovoltaic" title="Solar photovoltaic">Solar photovoltaic</a> modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price. Current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Concentrated_solar_thermal" title="Concentrated solar thermal">Concentrated solar thermal</a> power (CST) with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_storage" title="Thermal storage">thermal storage</a> has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated. <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">Wind turbines</a> generate 39 percent of Danish electricity, and Denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well. Together, wind and biomass provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country's six million inhabitants. In 2010, Portugal’s 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources. Spain’s 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables.</p>
<p>Renewable energy has a history of strong public support. In America, for example, a 2013 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gallup_survey" title="Gallup survey">Gallup survey</a> showed that two in three Americans want the U.S. to increase domestic energy production using solar power (76%), wind power (71%), and natural gas (65%). Far fewer want more petroleum production (46%) and more nuclear power (37%). Least favored is coal, with about one in three Americans favouring it.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/REN21" title="REN21">REN21</a> says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a binding 20% by 2020 target for the European Union. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">Nuclear power</a> involves substantial accident risks (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster" title="Fukushima nuclear disaster">Fukushima nuclear disaster</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>) and the unsolved problem of safe long-term <a href="/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_management" title="High-level radioactive waste management">high-level radioactive waste management</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> has rather limited safe storage potentials. These constraints have also led to an interest in 100% renewable energy. A well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade, evaluating scenarios for 100% renewable energy for various geographical areas. In recent years, more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources. The incentive to use 100% renewable energy is created by <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> and ecological as well as economic concerns, post <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>.</p>
<p>The first country to propose 100% renewable energy was <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, in 1998. Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003, and for Australia in 2011. <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources" title="List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources">Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay</a> obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal). Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower). Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet. Australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity. The road map for the United States, commitment by Denmark, and Vision 2050 for Europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100% renewable energy, later reduced to 2040 in 2011. Zero Carbon Britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in Britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy. In 2015, Hawaii enacted a law that the Renewable Portfolio Standard shall be 100 percent by 2045. This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh. Then the RPS is 115 percent.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy. Research that has been published in <a href="/wiki/Energy_Policy_(journal)" title="Energy Policy (journal)">Energy Policy</a> suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support. It would require building many more <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a> and solar power systems but wouldn't utilize <a href="/wiki/Bioenergy" title="Bioenergy">bioenergy</a>. Other changes involve use of <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric cars</a> and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage.</p>

<p><i><a href="/wiki/The_Fourth_Revolution:_Energy" title="The Fourth Revolution: Energy">The Fourth Revolution: Energy</a></i> is a German <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary film</a> released in 2010. It shows the vision of a global society, which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100% with renewable energies, showing a complete reconstruction of the economy, to reach this goal. In 2011, <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Scheer" title="Hermann Scheer">Hermann Scheer</a> wrote the book <i>The Energy Imperative: 100 Percent Renewable Now</i>, published by Routledge.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Reinventing_Fire" title="Reinventing Fire">Reinventing Fire</a></i> is a book by Amory Lovins released in October 2011. By combining reduced energy use with <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> gains, Lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy. This can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies, through market forces, led by business. <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> says the book is a "wise, detailed and comprehensive blueprint". The first paragraph of the preface says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change. No oil spills, dead coal miners, dirty air, devastated lands, lost wildlife. No energy poverty. No oil-fed wars, tyrannies, or terrorists. Nothing to run out. Nothing to cut off. Nothing to worry about. Just energy abundance, benign and affordable, for all, for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.</p>
<p>In 2011, the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> has said that <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> technologies, in its many forms, can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2011, the refereed journal <i><a href="/wiki/Energy_Policy_(journal)" title="Energy Policy (journal)">Energy Policy</a></i> published two articles by <a href="/wiki/Mark_Z._Jacobson" title="Mark Z. Jacobson">Mark Z. Jacobson</a>, a professor of engineering at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, and research scientist Mark A. Delucchi, about changing our energy supply mix and "Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power". The articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS), which are safe clean options. In Part I, Jacobson and Delucchi discuss WWS energy system characteristics, aspects of energy demand, WWS resource availability, WWS devices needed, and material requirements. They estimate that 3,800,000 5 MW <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_turbines" title="Wind turbines">wind turbines</a>, 5350 100 MW <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a> plants, and 270 new 1300 MW <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a> plants will be required. In terms of <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, an additional 49,000 300 MW <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Concentrating_solar" title="Concentrating solar">concentrating solar</a> plants, 40,000 300 MW <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_photovoltaic" title="Solar photovoltaic">solar photovoltaic</a> power plants, and 1.7 billion 3 kW rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed. Such an extensive WWS infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30%. In Part II, Jacobson and Delucchi address variability of supply, system economics, and energy policy initiatives associated with a WWS system. The authors advocate producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Energy costs with a WWS system should be similar to today's energy costs.</p>
<p>In general, Jacobson has said wind, water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world's energy, eliminating all <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>. He advocates a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 2012 study by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Delaware" title="University of Delaware">University of Delaware</a> for a 72 GW system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective, for the <a href="/wiki/PJM_Interconnection" title="PJM Interconnection">PJM Interconnection</a>, would use 17 GW of solar, 68 GW of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Offshore_wind" title="Offshore wind">offshore wind</a>, and 115 GW of onshore wind, although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided. 0.1% of the time would require generation from other sources.</p>
<p>In March 2012, Denmark's parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity, heat and fuels from renewables by 2050. IRENEC is an annual conference on 100% renewable energy started in 2011 by <a href="/wiki/Eurosolar" title="Eurosolar">Eurosolar</a> Turkey. The 2013 conference was in Istanbul.</p>
<p>More recently, Jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind, water and sunlight, for New York, California and Washington states, by 2050. As of 2014, a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up, which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states. The 50-state plan is part of <a href="/wiki/The_Solutions_Project" title="The Solutions Project">The Solutions Project</a>, an independent outreach effort led by Jacobson, actor <a href="/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo" title="Mark Ruffalo">Mark Ruffalo</a>, and film director <a href="/wiki/Josh_Fox" title="Josh Fox">Josh Fox</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2014, many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing, can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, hydro, ocean and geothermal energy. Debate over detailed plans remain, but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable, economically feasible, socially viable, and so realisable. This prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by Germany, one of the world's most successful industrial economies, to undertake a major <a href="/wiki/Energy_transition" title="Energy transition">energy transition</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energiewende" title="Energiewende">Energiewende</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015 a study was published in <i><a href="/wiki/Energy_and_Environmental_Science" title="Energy and Environmental Science">Energy and Environmental Science</a></i> that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass. Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable, as by 2050 it would save about $600 Billion Dollars <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Health_costs" title="Health costs">health costs</a> a year due to reduced <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> and $3.3 Trillion global warming costs. This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway. According to that study, barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political, as most people didn't know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Places_with_around_100.25_renewable_electricity">Places with around 100% renewable electricity</span></h2>
<p>The following places meet around 100%, or more (exporting to other regions), of their average yearly electricity demand with renewable energy:</p>

<p>Some other places have high percentages, for example the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Denmark" title="Electricity sector in Denmark">electricity sector in Denmark</a>, as of 2014, is 40% wind power, with plans in place to reach 85%. The <a href="/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Canada" title="Electricity sector in Canada">electricity sector in Canada</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_New_Zealand" title="Electricity sector in New Zealand">electricity sector in New Zealand</a> have even higher percentages, 65% and 75% respectively, and Austria is approaching 70%. As of 2015, the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Germany" title="Electricity sector in Germany">electricity sector in Germany</a> sometimes meets almost 100% of the electricity demand with PV and wind power, and renewable electricity is over 25%. <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a> has 94.8% of installed capacity as hydroelectric, 5.2% diesel generator; but Albania imports 39% of its electricity. In 2016, Portugal achieved 100% renewable electricity for four days between 7 May and 11 May, partly because <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">efficient energy use</a> had reduced electricity demand. France and Sweden have low carbon intensity, since they predominately use a mixture of nuclear power and hydroelectricity.</p>
<p>Although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy; it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases, as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification. For example, <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric cars</a> achieve much better <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miles_per_gallon_equivalent" title="Miles per gallon equivalent">miles per gallon equivalent</a> than fossil fuel cars, and another example is <a href="/wiki/Renewable_heat" title="Renewable heat">renewable heat</a> such as in the case of Denmark which is proposing to move to greater use of heat pumps for heating buildings which provide multiple kilowatts of heat per kilowatt of electricity.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Obstacles">Obstacles</span></h2>
<p>The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies, at the pace required to prevent <a href="/wiki/Runaway_climate_change" title="Runaway climate change">runaway climate change</a>, are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 <i>Post Carbon Pathways</i> report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are:</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> Climate scientist <a href="/wiki/James_Hansen" title="James Hansen">James Hansen</a> discusses the problem with rapid <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_phase-out" title="Fossil fuel phase-out">phase out of fossil fuels</a> and said that while it is conceivable in places such as New Zealand and Norway, "suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the <a href="/wiki/Easter_Bunny" title="Easter Bunny">Easter Bunny</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tooth_Fairy" title="Tooth Fairy">Tooth Fairy</a>." In 2013, Smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of Jacobson and colleagues, and writing in an issue of <i>Spectrum</i> prepared by the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a>, he identified numerous points of concern, such as cost, intermittent power supply, growing <a href="/wiki/NIMBY" title="NIMBY">NIMBYism</a>, and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that "History and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed." Smil and Hansen are concerned about the <a href="/wiki/Variable_renewable_energy" title="Variable renewable energy">variable output</a> of solar and wind power, but many other scientists and engineers have analysed this situation and said that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electricity_grid" title="Electricity grid">electricity grid</a> can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lester_R._Brown" title="Lester R. Brown">Lester R. Brown</a> founder and president of the <a href="/wiki/Earth_Policy_Institute" title="Earth Policy Institute">Earth Policy Institute</a>, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, D.C., says a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy is both possible and necessary. Brown compares with the U.S. entry into World War II and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the US industry and economy. A quick transition to 100% renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by Brown to follow an approach with similar urgency.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production. The issue of <a href="/wiki/Intermittent_energy_source" title="Intermittent energy source">intermittent supply</a> applies to popular renewable technologies, mainly <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_photovoltaics" title="Solar photovoltaics">solar photovoltaics</a>, and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when <a href="/wiki/Dispatchable_generation" title="Dispatchable generation">dispatchable generation</a> such as hydroelectricity or solar thermal storage is also available. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification. Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:</p>
<p>In 2011, the <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, the world's leading climate researchers selected by the United Nations, said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied". IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world". The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rajendra_Pachauri" title="Rajendra Pachauri">Rajendra Pachauri</a>, chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.</p>
<p>In November 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out with their <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fifth Assessment Report">fifth report</a>, saying that in the absence of any one technology (such as bioenergy, carbon dioxide capture and storage, nuclear, wind and solar), climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent. For example, it may cost 40% more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture. (Table 3.2)</p>
<p>Google spent $30 million on their RE&lt;C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.</p>
