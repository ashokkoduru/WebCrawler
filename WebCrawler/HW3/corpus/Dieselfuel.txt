<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
<p>Diesel fuel originated from experiments conducted by German scientist and inventor <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Diesel" title="Rudolf Diesel">Rudolf Diesel</a> for his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compression-ignition_engine" title="Compression-ignition engine">compression-ignition engine</a> he invented in 1892.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_fuel" title="Synthetic fuel">Synthetic fuel</a></div>
<p>Synthetic diesel can be produced from any carbonaceous material, including biomass, biogas, natural gas, coal and many others. The raw material is gasified into synthesis gas, which after purification is converted by the <a href="/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process" title="Fischer–Tropsch process">Fischer–Tropsch process</a> to a synthetic diesel.</p>
<p>The process is typically referred to as <a href="/wiki/Biomass_to_liquid" title="Biomass to liquid">biomass-to-liquid</a> (BTL), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas_to_liquid" title="Gas to liquid">gas-to-liquid</a> (GTL) or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_to_liquid" title="Coal to liquid">coal-to-liquid</a> (CTL), depending on the raw material used.</p>
<p>Paraffinic synthetic diesel generally has a near-zero content of sulfur and very low aromatics content, reducing unregulated emissions of toxic hydrocarbons, nitrous oxides and particulate matter (PM).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">Biodiesel</a></div>

<p>Fatty-acid methyl ester (FAME), more widely known as <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>, is obtained from <a href="/wiki/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oil</a> or animal fats (bio<a href="/wiki/Lipid" title="Lipid">lipids</a>) which have been <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterified</a> with <a href="/wiki/Methanol" title="Methanol">methanol</a>. It can be produced from many types of oils, the most common being <a href="/wiki/Rapeseed" title="Rapeseed">rapeseed</a> oil (rapeseed methyl ester, RME) in Europe and <a href="/wiki/Soybean_oil" title="Soybean oil">soybean oil</a> (soy methyl ester, SME) in the US. Methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process, which results in the production of ethyl esters. The transesterification processes use catalysts, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, to convert vegetable oil and methanol into FAME and the undesirable byproducts glycerine and water, which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces. FAME can be used pure (B100) in engines where the manufacturer approves such use, but it is more often used as a mix with diesel, BXX where XX is the biodiesel content in percent.</p>
<p>FAME as a fuel is regulated under <a href="/wiki/EN_14214" title="EN 14214">DIN EN 14214</a> and <a href="/wiki/ASTM_D6751" title="ASTM D6751">ASTM D6751</a>.</p>
<p>FAME has a lower energy content than diesel due to its oxygen content, and as a result, performance and fuel consumption can be affected. It also can have higher levels of NOx emissions, possibly even exceeding the legal limit. FAME also has lower oxidation stability than diesel, and it offers favorable conditions for bacterial growth, so applications which have a low fuel turnover should not use FAME. The loss in power when using pure biodiesel is 5–7%.</p>
<p>Fuel equipment manufacturers (FIE) have raised several concerns regarding FAME fuels: free methanol, dissolved and free water, free glycerin, <a href="/wiki/Monoglyceride" title="Monoglyceride">mono</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diglyceride" title="Diglyceride">diglycerides</a>, free <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a>, total solid impurity levels, alkaline metal compounds in solution and oxidation and thermal stability. They have also identified FAME as being the cause of the following problems: corrosion of fuel injection components, low-pressure fuel system blockage, increased dilution and <a href="/wiki/Polymerization" title="Polymerization">polymerization</a> of engine sump oil, pump seizures due to high fuel viscosity at low temperature, increased injection pressure, elastomeric seal failures and fuel injector spray blockage.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unsaturated_fatty_acid" title="Unsaturated fatty acid">Unsaturated fatty acids</a> are the source for the lower oxidation stability; they react with oxygen and form peroxides and result in degradation byproducts, which can cause sludge and lacquer in the fuel system.</p>
<p>As FAME contains low levels of sulfur, the emissions of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_oxide" title="Sulfur oxide">sulfur oxides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sulfate" title="Sulfate">sulfates</a>, major components of <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, are low. Use of biodiesel also results in reductions of unburned hydrocarbons, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), and particulate matter. CO emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced, on the order of 50% compared to most petrodiesel fuels. The exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel have been found to be 30% lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel. The exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons (a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone) are up to 93% lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel.</p>
<p>Biodiesel also may reduce health risks associated with petroleum diesel. Biodiesel emissions showed decreased levels of <a href="/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon" title="Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</a> (PAH) and nitrited PAH compounds, which have been identified as potential cancer-causing compounds. In recent testing, PAH compounds were reduced by 75–85%, except for <a href="/wiki/Benz(a)anthracene" title="Benz(a)anthracene">benz(a)anthracene</a>, which was reduced by roughly 50%. Targeted nPAH compounds were also reduced dramatically with biodiesel fuel, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2-nitrofluorene" title="2-nitrofluorene">2-nitrofluorene</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1-nitropyrene" title="1-nitropyrene">1-nitropyrene</a> reduced by 90%, and the rest of the nPAH compounds reduced to only trace levels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogenated_oils_and_fats">Hydrogenated oils and fats</span></h3>
<p>This category of diesel fuels involves converting the <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglycerides</a> in vegetable oil and animal fats into alkanes by <a href="/wiki/Vegetable_oil_refining" title="Vegetable oil refining">refining</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/H-Bio" title="H-Bio">H-Bio</a>. The produced fuel has many properties that are similar to synthetic diesel, and are free from the many disadvantages of FAME.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="DME">DME</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dimethyl_ether" title="Dimethyl ether">Dimethyl ether</a>, DME, is a synthetic, gaseous diesel fuel that results in clean combustion with very little soot and reduced NOx emissions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage">Storage</span></h2>
<p>In the US, diesel is recommended to be stored in a yellow container to differentiate it from <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>, which are typically kept in blue and red containers, respectively. In the UK, diesel is normally stored in a black container, to differentiate it from unleaded petrol (which is commonly stored in a green container) and leaded petrol (which is stored in a red container).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Cetane_number" title="Cetane number">Cetane number</a></div>
<p>The principal measure of diesel fuel quality is its <a href="/wiki/Cetane_number" title="Cetane number">cetane number</a>. A cetane number is a measure of the delay of ignition of a diesel fuel. A higher cetane number indicates that the fuel ignites more readily when sprayed into hot compressed air. European (EN 590 standard) road diesel has a minimum cetane number of 51. Fuels with higher cetane numbers, normally "premium" diesel fuels with additional cleaning agents and some synthetic content, are available in some markets.</p>

<p>As of 2010, the density of petroleum diesel is about 0.832 kg/L (6.943 lb/US gal), about 11.6% more than ethanol-free <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">petrol (gasoline)</a>, which has a density of about 0.745 kg/L (6.217 lb/US gal). About 86.1% of the fuel mass is carbon, and when burned, it offers a net heating value of 43.1 MJ/kg as opposed to 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline. However, due to the higher density, diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 MJ/L (128,700 BTU/US gal) vs. 32.18 MJ/L (115,500 BTU/US gal) for gasoline, some 11% higher, which should be considered when comparing the fuel efficiency by volume. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from diesel are 73.25 g/MJ, just slightly lower than for gasoline at 73.38 g/MJ. Diesel is generally simpler to refine from petroleum than gasoline, and contains hydrocarbons having a boiling point in the range of 180–360 °C (360–680 °F). The price of diesel traditionally rises during colder months as demand for <a href="/wiki/Heating_oil" title="Heating oil">heating oil</a> rises, which is refined in much the same way. Because of recent changes in fuel quality regulations, additional refining is required to remove sulfur, which contributes to a sometimes higher cost. In many parts of the United States and throughout the United Kingdom and Australia, diesel may be priced higher than petrol. Reasons for higher-priced diesel include the shutdown of some refineries in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, diversion of mass refining capacity to gasoline production, and a recent transfer to <a href="/wiki/Ultra-low-sulfur_diesel" title="Ultra-low-sulfur diesel">ultra-low-sulfur diesel</a> (ULSD), which causes infrastructural complications. In Sweden, a diesel fuel designated as MK-1 (class 1 environmental diesel) is also being sold; this is a ULSD that also has a lower aromatics content, with a limit of 5%. This fuel is slightly more expensive to produce than regular ULSD.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxation">Taxation</span></h3>
<p>Diesel fuel is very similar to <a href="/wiki/Heating_oil" title="Heating oil">heating oil</a>, which is used in <a href="/wiki/Central_heating" title="Central heating">central heating</a>. In Europe, the United States, and Canada, <a href="/wiki/Tax" title="Tax">taxes</a> on diesel fuel are higher than on heating oil due to the <a href="/wiki/Fuel_tax" title="Fuel tax">fuel tax</a>, and in those areas, heating oil is marked with <a href="/wiki/Fuel_dyes" title="Fuel dyes">fuel dyes</a> and trace chemicals to prevent and detect <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tax_fraud" title="Tax fraud">tax fraud</a>. "Untaxed" diesel (sometimes called "off-road diesel") is available in some countries for use primarily in agricultural applications, such as fuel for tractors, recreational and utility vehicles or other <a href="/wiki/Non-commercial" title="Non-commercial">noncommercial</a> vehicles that do not use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_road" title="Public road">public roads</a>. This fuel may have sulfur levels that exceed the limits for road use in some countries (e.g. US).</p>
<p>This untaxed diesel is dyed red for identification, and using this untaxed diesel fuel for a typically taxed purpose (such as driving use), the user can be fined (e.g. US$10,000 in the US). In the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, it is known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_diesel" title="Red diesel">red diesel</a> (or gas oil), and is also used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agricultural" title="Agricultural">agricultural</a> vehicles, home heating tanks, refrigeration units on vans/trucks which contain perishable items such as food and medicine and for marine craft. Diesel fuel, or marked gas oil is dyed green in the Republic of Ireland and Norway. The term "diesel-engined road vehicle" (DERV) is used in the UK as a synonym for unmarked road diesel fuel. In India, taxes on diesel fuel are lower than on petrol, as the majority of the transportation for grain and other essential commodities across the country runs on diesel.</p>
<p>Taxes on <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> in the US vary between states; some states (Texas, for example) have no tax on biodiesel and a reduced tax on biodiesel blends equivalent to the amount of biodiesel in the blend, so that B20 fuel is taxed 20% less than pure petrodiesel. Other states, such as North Carolina, tax biodiesel (in any blended configuration) the same as petrodiesel, although they have introduced new incentives to producers and users of all biofuels.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>
<p>Unlike <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas" title="Liquefied petroleum gas">liquefied petroleum gas</a> engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (<a href="/wiki/Compression_ratio" title="Compression ratio">compression ratios</a> from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees before <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Top_dead_center" title="Top dead center">top dead center</a> (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidize" title="Oxidize">oxidize</a>), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. Engines have <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glow_plug" title="Glow plug">glow plugs</a> and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum <a href="/wiki/Operating_temperature" title="Operating temperature">operating temperature</a>. Diesel engines are <b>lean burn</b> engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. They thus use less fuel than <b>rich burn</b> spark ignition engines which use a <a href="/wiki/Stoichiometry" title="Stoichiometry">stoichiometric</a> air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, "due to the absence of throttling [constant amount of air admitted, per unit fuel, with no user-determined variation], and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of &gt;20% lower fuel use and (given difference in differences in energy content between fuel types) &gt;15% lower energy use. <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">Gas turbine</a> and some other types of internal combustion engines, and <a href="/wiki/External_combustion_engine" title="External combustion engine">external combustion engine</a>, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a> requirement of diesel fuel is usually specified at 40 °C. A disadvantage of diesel as a vehicle fuel in cold climates, is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a <a href="/wiki/Gel" title="Gel">gel</a> (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compression_ignition#Gelling" title="Compression ignition">Compression Ignition – Gelling</a>) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special <a href="/wiki/Winter_diesel_fuel" title="Winter diesel fuel">low-temperature diesel</a> contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures, but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties. Another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol/gasoline engines is the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine_runaway" title="Diesel engine runaway">diesel engine runaway</a> failure. Since diesel engines do not need spark ignition, they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied. Fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump. If the pump breaks down in an "open" position, the supply of fuel will be unrestricted, and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure.</p>
<p>With <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turbocharged" title="Turbocharged">turbocharged</a> engines, the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail, allowing lubricating oil into the combustion chamber, where it is burned like regular diesel fuel. In vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also <a href="/wiki/Bottled_gas" title="Bottled gas">bottled gas</a>, a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a runaway, via the engine air intake.</p>
<p>The crank case ventilation of modern road-use diesel engines is diverted into the intake manifold, because ventilating the crank case into outside air is inadvisable due to lubricant mist it contains. If the engine's piston rings malfunction, this will cause excessive pressure in the crank case forcing mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold. Since most engines use oil which can be burnt in the same fashion as diesel, this will result in <a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine_runaway" title="Diesel engine runaway">diesel engine runaway</a>. To prevent that, more premium crank case ventilation solutions are fitted with a filter to catch out lubricant mist.</p>
<p>Most modern road use diesel engines are provided with an <a href="/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic" title="Fibre-reinforced plastic">FRP</a> valve in the intake manifold (usually mistaken by some as a petrol engine throttle body). In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an <a href="/wiki/Electronic_control_unit" title="Electronic control unit">electronic control unit</a> when it senses runaway scenario.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">Diesel-powered</a> cars generally have a better <a href="/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles" title="Fuel economy in automobiles">fuel economy</a> than equivalent gasoline engines and produce less <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emission. Their greater economy is due to the higher energy per-litre content of diesel fuel and the intrinsic efficiency of the diesel engine. While petrodiesel's higher density results in higher greenhouse gas emissions per litre compared to gasoline, the 20–40% better fuel economy achieved by modern diesel-engined automobiles offsets the higher per-litre emissions of greenhouse gases, and a diesel-powered vehicle emits 10–20 percent less greenhouse gas than comparable gasoline vehicles. <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">Biodiesel</a>-powered diesel engines offer substantially improved emission reductions compared to petrodiesel or gasoline-powered engines, while retaining most of the fuel economy advantages over conventional gasoline-powered automobiles. However, the increased compression ratios mean there are increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) from diesel engines. This is compounded by biological nitrogen in biodiesel to make NO<sub>x</sub> emissions the main drawback of diesel versus gasoline engines.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tractors_and_heavy_equipment">Tractors and heavy equipment</span></h3>
<p>Today's <a href="/wiki/Tractor" title="Tractor">tractors</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heavy_equipment" title="Heavy equipment">heavy equipment</a> are mostly diesel-powered. Among tractors, only the smaller classes may also offer gasoline engines. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dieselization" title="Dieselization">dieselization</a> of tractors and heavy equipment began in Germany before World War II but was unusual in the United States until after that war. During the 1950s and 1960s, it progressed in the latter country as well.</p>
<p>Tractors and heavy equipment were often <a href="/wiki/Multifuel" title="Multifuel">multifuel</a> in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors of the era could burn gasoline, <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">alcohol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a>, and any light grade of <a href="/wiki/Fuel_oil" title="Fuel oil">fuel oil</a> such as diesel fuel, <a href="/wiki/Heating_oil" title="Heating oil">heating oil</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Tractor_vaporising_oil" title="Tractor vaporising oil">tractor vaporising oil</a>, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name "distillate" often referred to any of the aforementioned light fuel oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as <a href="/wiki/Carburetor#Vaporizers" title="Carburetor">vaporizers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Radiator_(engine_cooling)#Radiator_blind" title="Radiator (engine cooling)">radiator shrouds</a> were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more <a href="/wiki/Engine_efficiency" title="Engine efficiency">efficient</a> use of the diesel fuel being burned.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_uses">Other uses</span></h3>

<p>Diesel fuel is also often used as the main ingredient in oil-base mud drilling fluid. The advantage of using diesel is its low cost and that it delivers excellent results when drilling a wide variety of difficult strata including shale, salt and gypsum formations. Diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40% brine water. Due to health, safety and environmental concerns, Diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable, mineral, or synthetic food-grade oil-base drilling fluids, although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions.</p>

<p>Most diesel fuels freeze at common winter temperatures, while the temperatures greatly vary. Petrodiesel typically freezes around temperatures of −8.1 °C (17.5 °F), whereas biodiesel freezes between temperatures of 2° to 15 °C (35° to 60 °F). The viscosity of diesel noticeably increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel at temperatures of −19 °C (−2.2 °F) to −15 °C (5 °F), that cannot flow in fuel systems. Conventional diesel fuels vaporise at temperatures between 149 °C and 371 °C.</p>
<p>Conventional diesel <a href="/wiki/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash points</a> vary between 52 and 96 °C, which makes it safer than petrol and unsuitable for spark-ignition engines. Unlike petrol, the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hazards">Hazards</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Reduction_of_sulfur_emissions">Reduction of sulfur emissions</span></h4>
<p>In the past, diesel fuel contained higher quantities of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>. <a href="/wiki/European_emission_standards" title="European emission standards">European emission standards</a> and preferential taxation have forced <a href="/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a> to dramatically reduce the level of sulfur in diesel fuels. In the European Union, the sulfur content has dramatically reduced during the last 20 years. Automotive diesel fuel is covered in the European Union by standard <a href="/wiki/EN_590" title="EN 590">EN 590</a>. In the 1990s specifications allowed a content of 2000 ppm max of sulphur, reduced to a limit of 350 ppm by the beginning of the 21st century with the introduction of Euro 3 specifications. The limit was lowered with the introduction of Euro 4 by 2006 to 50 ppm (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ULSD" title="ULSD">ULSD</a>, Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel). The standard currently in force in European Europe for Diesel Fuel is the Euro 5, with a maximum content of 10 ppm.</p>

<p>In the United States, more stringent emission standards have been adopted with the transition to <a href="/wiki/Ultra-low-sulfur_diesel" title="Ultra-low-sulfur diesel">ULSD</a> starting in 2006, and becoming mandatory on June 1, 2010 (see also <a href="/wiki/Diesel_exhaust" title="Diesel exhaust">diesel exhaust</a>). U.S. diesel fuel typically also has a lower <a href="/wiki/Cetane_number" title="Cetane number">cetane number</a> (a measure of ignition quality) than European diesel, resulting in worse cold weather performance and some increase in emissions.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment_hazards_of_sulfur">Environment hazards of sulfur</span></h4>
<p>High levels of sulfur in diesel are harmful for the environment because they prevent the use of catalytic <a href="/wiki/Diesel_particulate_filter" title="Diesel particulate filter">diesel particulate filters</a> to control <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diesel_particulate_matter" title="Diesel particulate matter">diesel particulate emissions</a>, as well as more advanced technologies, such as nitrogen oxide (<a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide#NOx" title="Nitrogen oxide">NO<sub>x</sub></a>) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adsorb" title="Adsorb">adsorbers</a> (still under development), to reduce emissions. Moreover, sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion, producing <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_trioxide" title="Sulfur trioxide">sulfur trioxide</a>, that in presence of water rapidly convert to <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a>, one of the chemical processes that results in <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>. However, the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the <a href="/wiki/Lubrication" title="Lubrication">lubricity</a> of the fuel, meaning that <a href="/wiki/Oil_additive" title="Oil additive">additives</a> must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines. <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">Biodiesel</a> and biodiesel/petrodiesel blends, with their higher lubricity levels, are increasingly being utilized as an alternative. The U.S. annual consumption of diesel fuel in 2006 was about 190 billion litres (42 billion imperial gallons or 50 billion US gallons).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Algae.2C_microbes.2C_and_water_contamination">Algae, microbes, and water contamination</span></h4>
<p>There has been much discussion and misunderstanding of <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a> in diesel fuel. Algae need light to live and grow. As there is no sunlight in a closed fuel tank, no algae can survive, but some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbes" title="Microbes">microbes</a> can survive and feed on the diesel fuel.</p>
<p>These microbes form a colony that lives at the interface of fuel and water. They grow quite fast in warmer temperatures. They can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed. Parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and fuel filters.</p>
<p>Water in fuel can damage a fuel <a href="/wiki/Injection_pump" title="Injection pump">injection pump</a>; some diesel <a href="/wiki/Fuel_filter" title="Fuel filter">fuel filters</a> also trap water. Water contamination in diesel fuel can lead to freezing while in the fuel tank. The freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump. Once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze, gelling is more likely to occur. When the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Road_hazard">Road hazard</span></h4>
<p>Petrodiesel spilled on a roadway poses a hazard to vehicles, due to its high evaporation temperature. After the light fractions have evaporated, a greasy slick is left on the road which can destabilize moving vehicles, causing them to skid. Diesel spills severely reduce <a href="/wiki/Tire" title="Tire">tire</a> grip and traction, and have been implicated in many accidents. The loss of traction is similar to that encountered on <a href="/wiki/Black_ice" title="Black ice">black ice</a>. Diesel slicks are especially dangerous for two-wheeled vehicles such as <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle" title="Motorcycle">motorcycles</a>.</p>
