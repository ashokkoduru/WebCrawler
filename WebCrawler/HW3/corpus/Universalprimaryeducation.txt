<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Achieving_Universal_Primary_Education">Achieving Universal Primary Education</span></h2>
<p>Since 1999, there has been great progress towards achieving universal primary enrollment due in large part to a pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Education for All (EFA) The number of primary school age out-of-school children dropped by 42% between 2000 and 2012, despite rapid population growth. Greater than half of countries and regions worldwide have a net enrolment rate of more than 95% and either already have or are close to achieving <a class="external text" href="http://data.unicef.org/education/primary" rel="nofollow">universal primary education</a>. However, despite an increase in enrollment over the past decade, global progress has stalled since 2007, and net enrolment or attendance is less than 80 per cent in about 20 countries. Of the 58 million children out of school:</p>
<ul>
<li>23% attended school in the past but left</li>
<li>43% are likely to never enter school</li>
<li>34% are likely to enter school in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly half of all out-of-school children come from just a few countries, many of them characterized by conflict, instability, and extreme poverty. West and Central Africa is home to one-third of all primary school age out-of-school children, making it the region with the lowest rates of school participation. Challenges to achieving universal primary education are exacerbated in unstable regions, as they have greater difficulty in accessing financial support.</p>
<p>The barriers which prevent children around the world from obtaining primary level education are diverse and require tailored responses. Children living in conflict-affected areas account for “just 20% of the world’s children of primary school age but 50% of the world’s out-of-school children.” Additionally, inequalities in wealth significantly impact out-of-school rates. In many countries, children from the poorest 20 per cent of the population are less likely to attend school than those who are better off . Despite overall improvements, girls continue to be at a disadvantage as 53%—<a class="external text" href="http://data.unicef.org/education/primary" rel="nofollow">more than half</a>—of the estimated 58 million primary age out-of-school-children are girls.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Factors_contributing_to_lack_of_access_and_poor_attendance">Factors contributing to lack of access and poor attendance</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Location_.28climate.29">Location (climate)</span></h3>
<p><b>Location</b> contributes to a child’s lack of access and attendance to <a href="/wiki/Primary_education" title="Primary education">primary education</a>. In certain areas of the world it is more difficult for children to get to school. For example; in high-altitude areas of India, severe weather conditions for more than 7 months of the year make school attendance erratic and force children to remain at home (Postiglione).</p>
<p>In these remote locations, insufficient school funds contribute to low attendance rates by creating undesirable and unsafe learning environments. In 1996, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Accounting_Office" title="General Accounting Office">General Accounting Office</a> (GAO) reported that poor conditions existed in many rural areas; one out of every two rural schools had at least one inadequate structural or mechanical feature (Lawrence). In these situations where regular school attendance is rare, a low population contributes to the problem. In other locations, large numbers are often the cause of low attendance rates.</p>
<p>Due to population growth, many urban schools have expanded their boundaries making school transportation more complicated. “For over 50 years the U.S. has been shifting away from small, neighborhood schools to larger schools in lower density areas. Rates of children walking and biking to school have declined significantly over this period” (Schlossberg). There is evidence to prove that the distance to and from school contributes a child’s attendance, or lack thereof. In a study done investigating the relation between location (distance) and school attendance in Mali, about half the villages reported that the school was too far away, causing students not to enroll (Birdsall).</p>
<p>There is still speculation as to whether primary schools are more accessible in rural or urban areas because situations differ depending on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geographic_location" title="Geographic location">geographic location</a>. In a study done examining the correlation between location and school attendance in <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>, researchers found that urban residence was positively correlated with school attendance (De Vos), but another study in a <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> school district found that schools with the lowest attendance rates were in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metropolitan_areas" title="Metropolitan areas">metropolitan areas</a> (Moonie).</p>
<p>More research needs to be done to determine geography’s specific effects on attendance, but no matter where you live, there is evidence that <b>location</b> will contribute to a child’s access and attendance to education.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gender">Gender</span></h3>
<p><b>Gender</b> contributes to a child's lack of access and attendance to education. Although it may not be as an obvious a problem today, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Gender_equality_in_education&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Gender equality in education (page does not exist)">gender equality in education</a> has been an issue for a long time. Many investments in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Girls%27_education" title="Girls' education">girls' education</a> in the 1900s addressed the widespread lack of access to primary education in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> (Dowd).</p>
<p>There is currently a gender discrepancy in education. In 25 countries the proportion of boys enrolling in secondary school is higher than girls by 10% or more, and in five; <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Togo" title="Togo">Togo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, the gap exceeds 20%. Enrollment is low for both boys and girls in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, with rates of just 27% and 22%. Girls trail respectively behind (Douglas). It is generally believed that girls are often discouraged from attending primary schooling, especially in less developed countries for religious and cultural reasons, but there is little evidence available to support this association. However, there is evidence to prove that the disparity of gender in education is real. Today some 78% of girls drop out of school, compared with 48% of boys (Douglas). A child’s <b>gender</b> continues to contribute to access and attendance today.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost">Cost</span></h3>
<p><b>Costs</b> contribute to a child’s lack of acquiescence and attendance to primary education. High <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opportunity_costs" title="Opportunity costs">opportunity costs</a> are often influential in the decision to attend school. For example; an estimated 121 million children of primary-school age are being kept out of school to work in the fields or at home (UNICEF). For many families in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> the economic benefits of no primary schooling are enough to offset the <a href="/wiki/Opportunity_cost" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a> of attending.</p>
<p>Besides the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opportunity_costs" title="Opportunity costs">opportunity costs</a> associated with education, school fees can be very expensive, especially for poor households. In rural China, families dedicate as much as a third of their <a href="/wiki/Income" title="Income">income</a> to school fees (Peverly). Sometimes, the cost gets too expensive and families can’t support their children’s education anymore, although the statistics disagree. "China has 108.6 million primary school students, with a 1 percent dropout rate, but experts doubt these figures because the dropout rates in rural areas appear much higher" (Peverly).</p>
<p>Although the relationship between school fees and attendance still isn’t perfectly clear (Peverly), there is evidence to prove that <b>cost</b> is a factor that contributes to a child’s access and attendance to primary education.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h3>
<p>In developing countries throughout the world the educational context is characterized not by monolingual settings, but rather multilingual situations. Often children are asked to enroll in a primary school where the Medium of Instruction (MI) is not her home language, but rather the language of the government, or another dominant society <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.id21.org/insights/insights-ed05/art06.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001297/129728e.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="http://www2.unescobkk.org/elib/publications/first_language/first_language.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/wp/2000Walter.PDF" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Studies throughout the world demonstrate the importance of the MI in determining a child's educational attainment. According to <a href="/wiki/Santosh_Mehrotra" title="Santosh Mehrotra">Mehrotra</a> (1988) "In a situation where the parents are illiterate..., if the medium of instruction in school is a language that is not spoken at home the problems of learning in an environment characterized by poverty are compounded, and the chances of drop-out increase correspondingly. In this context, the experience of the high-achievers has been unequivocal: the mother tongue was used as the medium of instruction at the primary level in all cases. ... There is much research which shows that students learn to read more quickly when taught in their mother tongue. Second, students who have learned to read in their mother tongue learn to read in a second language more quickly than do those who are first taught to read in the second language. Third, in terms of academic learning skills as well, students taught to read in their mother tongue acquire such skills more quickly".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Education_and_global_health">Education and global health</span></h2>
<p>Education is a crucial factor in ending global poverty. With education, employment opportunities are broadened, income levels are increased and maternal and child health is improved.</p>
<p>In areas where access, attendance and quality of education have seen improvements, there has also been a slow in the spread of HIV/AIDS and an increase in the healthiness of the community in general. In fact, children of educated mothers are 50% more likely to live past the age of five. Not only does education improve individual and familial health, but it also improves the health of a community. In countries with solid education systems in place, there are lower crime rates, greater economic growth and improved social services.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="School_feeding_programs">School feeding programs</span></h2>
<p>“There are approximately 300 million chronically hungry children in the world. One hundred million of them do not attend school, and two thirds of those not attending school are girls. <a href="/wiki/World_Food_Programme" title="World Food Programme">World Food Programme</a>'s school feeding formula is simple: food attracts hungry children to school. An education broadens their options, helping to lift them out of poverty.”–World Food Programme</p>
<p>One successful method to ensuring that children attend school on a regular basis is through school feeding programs. Many different organizations fund school feeding programs, among them the World Food Programme and the World Bank. The idea of a school feeding program is that children are provided with meals at school with the expectation that they will attend school regularly. School feeding programs have proven a huge success because not only do the attendance rates increase, but in areas where food is scarce and malnutrition is extensive, the food that children are receiving at school can prove to be a critical source of nutrition. School meals have led to improved concentration and performance of children in school. Another aspect of school feeding programs is take home rations. When economic reasons, the need to care for the elderly or a family member suffering from HIV, or cultural beliefs keep a parent from sending their child (especially a female child) to school, these take home rations provide incentives to sending their children to school rather than to work</p>
