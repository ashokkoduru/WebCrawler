<p>The English name "China" is first attested in <a href="/wiki/Richard_Eden" title="Richard Eden">Richard Eden</a>'s 1555 translation of the 1516 journal of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portuguese_empire" title="Portuguese empire">Portuguese</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portuguese_exploration" title="Portuguese exploration">explorer</a> <a href="/wiki/Duarte_Barbosa" title="Duarte Barbosa">Duarte Barbosa</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Demonym" title="Demonym">demonym</a>, that is, the name for the people, and adjectival form "Chinese" developed later on the model of Portuguese <i><span lang="pt">chinês</span></i> and French <i><span lang="fr">chinois</span></i>. Portuguese <i>China</i> is thought to derive from <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian</a> <i>Chīn</i> (<span lang="fa"><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%DA%86%DB%8C%D9%86" title="wikt:چین">چین</a></span>), and perhaps ultimately from <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Chinas" title="Chinas">Cīna</a></i> (<span lang="sa"><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%A8" title="wikt:चीन">चीन</a></span>). <i>Cīna</i> was first used in early <a href="/wiki/Hindu" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> scripture, including the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata" title="Mahābhārata">Mahābhārata</a></i> (5th century <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>) and the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Manusm%E1%B9%9Bti" title="Manusmṛti">Laws of Manu</a></i> (2nd century <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>). The traditional theory, proposed in the 17th century by <a href="/wiki/Martino_Martini" title="Martino Martini">Martino Martini</a> and supported by many later scholars, is that the word "China" and its earlier related forms are ultimately derived from the state of <a href="/wiki/Qin_(state)" title="Qin (state)">Qin</a> (<span lang="zh-hans"><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A7%A6" title="wikt:秦">秦</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/Old_Chinese" title="Old Chinese">Old Chinese</a>: *<i>Dzin</i>), the westernmost of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_ancient_Chinese_states" title="List of ancient Chinese states">Chinese states</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Zhou_dynasty" title="Zhou dynasty">Zhou dynasty</a> which unified China to form the <a href="/wiki/Qin_dynasty" title="Qin dynasty">Qin dynasty</a>.

<p>According to Chinese tradition, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Chinese_dynasties" title="List of Chinese dynasties">first dynasty</a> was the <a href="/wiki/Xia_dynasty" title="Xia dynasty">Xia</a>, which emerged around 2100 <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>. The dynasty was considered <a href="/wiki/Chinese_mythology" title="Chinese mythology">mythical</a> by historians until scientific excavations found early <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> sites at <a href="/wiki/Erlitou_culture" title="Erlitou culture">Erlitou</a>, Henan in 1959. It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the <a href="/wiki/Xia_dynasty" title="Xia dynasty">Xia dynasty</a> or of another culture from the same period. The succeeding <a href="/wiki/Shang_dynasty" title="Shang dynasty">Shang dynasty</a> is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records. The Shang ruled the plain of the <a href="/wiki/Yellow_River" title="Yellow River">Yellow River</a> in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>. Their <a href="/wiki/Oracle_bone_script" title="Oracle bone script">oracle bone script</a> (from c.<span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 1500</span> <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>) represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found, and is a direct ancestor of modern <a href="/wiki/Chinese_characters" title="Chinese characters">Chinese characters</a>. The Shang were conquered by the <a href="/wiki/Zhou_dynasty" title="Zhou dynasty">Zhou</a>, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Period" title="Spring and Autumn Period">Spring and Autumn Period</a>, only occasionally deferring to the Zhou king. By the time of the <a href="/wiki/Warring_States_period" title="Warring States period">Warring States period</a> of the 5th–3rd centuries <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span>, there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now China, each with its own king, ministry and army.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Imperial_China">Imperial China</span></h3>


<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Warring_States" title="Warring States">Warring States</a> period ended in 221 <span class="smallcaps"><span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">BC</span></span> after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/State_of_Qin" title="State of Qin">state of Qin</a> conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified Chinese state. Its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/King_Zheng_of_Qin" title="King Zheng of Qin">King Zheng</a> proclaimed himself the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_Emperor" title="First Emperor">First Emperor</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Qin_Dynasty" title="Qin Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> (<i>Qín Shǐhuáng</i> or <i>Shǐ Huángdì</i>). He enacted Qin's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legalism_(philosophy)" title="Legalism (philosophy)">legalist</a> reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of <a href="/wiki/Chinese_characters" title="Chinese characters">Chinese characters</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chinese_units" title="Chinese units">measurements</a>, road widths (i.e., cart axles' length), and <a href="/wiki/History_of_Chinese_currency" title="History of Chinese currency">currency</a>. His dynasty also <a href="/wiki/Qin%27s_campaign_against_the_Yue_tribes" title="Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes">conquered the Yue tribes</a> in <a href="/wiki/Guangxi" title="Guangxi">Guangxi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>, and northern <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Qin_dynasty" title="Qin dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.</p>

The Han <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/History_of_the_Han_Dynasty" title="History of the Han Dynasty">expanded the empire's territory considerably</a>, with military campaigns reaching <a href="/wiki/Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu_War" title="Han–Xiongnu War">Central Asia, Mongolia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gojoseon%E2%80%93Han_War" title="Gojoseon–Han War">Korea</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Han_campaigns_against_Dian" title="Han campaigns against Dian">Yunnan</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Southward_expansion_of_the_Han_dynasty" title="Southward expansion of the Han dynasty">recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam</a> from <a href="/wiki/Nanyue" title="Nanyue">Nanyue</a>.

<p>Under the succeeding <a href="/wiki/Tang_dynasty" title="Tang dynasty">Tang</a> and <a href="/wiki/Song_dynasty" title="Song dynasty">Song</a> dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age. The Tang Empire returned control of the <a href="/wiki/Western_Regions" title="Western Regions">Western Regions</a> and the Silk Road, and made the capital <a href="/wiki/Chang%27an" title="Chang'an">Chang'an</a> a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/An_Shi_Rebellion" title="An Shi Rebellion">An Shi Rebellion</a> in the 8th century. In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely with the local military governors being ungovernable. The Song Dynasty ended the <a href="/wiki/Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period" title="Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period">separatist situation</a> in 960, as a result the balance of power appeared between Song and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Khitan_Liao" title="Khitan Liao">Khitan Liao</a>. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese <a href="/wiki/Polity" title="Polity">polity</a> to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a <a href="/wiki/Neo-Confucianism" title="Neo-Confucianism">revival of Confucianism</a>, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang, and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Landscape_art" title="Landscape art">landscape art</a> and <a href="/wiki/Porcelain" title="Porcelain">porcelain</a> were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.

A peasant named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zhu_Yuanzhang" title="Zhu Yuanzhang">Zhu Yuanzhang</a> overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 and founded the <a href="/wiki/Ming_dynasty" title="Ming dynasty">Ming dynasty</a>. Under the Ming Dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that <a href="/wiki/Zheng_He" title="Zheng He">Zheng He</a> led <a href="/wiki/Treasure_voyages" title="Treasure voyages">voyages throughout the world, reaching as far as Africa</a>. In the early years of the Ming Dynasty, China's capital was moved from <a href="/wiki/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a> to Beijing.

The <a href="/wiki/Scholar-official" title="Scholar-official">scholar-official</a> stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and the wars against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598)" title="Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)">Japanese invasions of Korea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Qing_conquest_of_the_Ming" title="Qing conquest of the Ming">Manchu invasions</a> led to an exhausted treasury.</p>
<p>In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by <a href="/wiki/Li_Zicheng" title="Li Zicheng">Li Zicheng</a>. The last Ming <a href="/wiki/Chongzhen_Emperor" title="Chongzhen Emperor">Chongzhen Emperor</a> committed suicide when the city fell.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Qing_dynasty" title="Qing dynasty">Qing dynasty</a>, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. Its conquest of the Ming (1618–1683) costed 25 million lives and the <a href="/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_before_1912#Qing_.28Manchu.29_Dynasty_.281644.E2.80.931912_CE.29" title="Economic history of China before 1912">economic scale of China shrank drastically</a>.

In the 19th century, the dynasty experienced Western imperialism following the <a href="/wiki/First_Opium_War" title="First Opium War">First Opium War</a> (1839–42) and the <a href="/wiki/Second_Opium_War" title="Second Opium War">Second Opium War</a> (1856–60) with Britain and France.

The <a href="/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War" title="First Sino-Japanese War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> (1894–95) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the <a href="/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" title="Korean Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a>, as well as the cession of Taiwan to <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The Qing dynasty also began experiencing <a href="/wiki/Timeline_of_late_anti-Qing_rebellions" title="Timeline of late anti-Qing rebellions">internal unrest</a> in which tens of millions of people died, especially for the failed <a href="/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion" title="Taiping Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a> that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the <a href="/wiki/Dungan_Revolt_(1862%E2%80%9377)" title="Dungan Revolt (1862–77)">Dungan Revolt</a> (1862–77) in the northwest. The initial success of the <a href="/wiki/Self-Strengthening_Movement" title="Self-Strengthening Movement">Self-Strengthening Movement</a> of the 1860s was frustrated by the series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, the great <a href="/wiki/Chinese_emigration" title="Chinese emigration">Chinese Diaspora</a> began.

<p>On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and <a href="/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen" title="Sun Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president.

In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own <a href="/wiki/Beiyang_Army" title="Beiyang Army">Beiyang Army</a>, he was forced to abdicate and reestablish the republic.</p>
<p>After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek" title="Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, the then Principal of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China_Military_Academy" title="Republic of China Military Academy">Republic of China Military Academy</a>, was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings, known collectively as the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Expedition" title="Northern Expedition">Northern Expedition</a>. The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to <a href="/wiki/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a> and implemented "political tutelage", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San-min_Doctrine" title="San-min Doctrine">San-min</a> program for transforming China into a modern democratic state. The <a href="/wiki/List_of_warlords_and_military_cliques_in_the_Warlord_Era" title="List of warlords and military cliques in the Warlord Era">political division</a> in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chinese_Communists" title="Chinese Communists">Communists</a>, against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a>.

Japanese forces committed numerous <a href="/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes" title="Japanese war crimes">war atrocities</a> against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died. An estimated 200,000 Chinese <a href="/wiki/Nanking_Massacre" title="Nanking Massacre">were massacred</a> in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation. During the war, China, along with the UK, the US and the Soviet Union, were referred to as "trusteeship of the powerful" and were recognized as the Allied "<a href="/wiki/Four_Policemen" title="Four Policemen">Big Four</a>" in the <a href="/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations" title="Declaration by United Nations">Declaration by United Nations</a>.

China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war.

<p>Mao's regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the land reform with between 1 and 2 million <a href="/wiki/Landlord" title="Landlord">landlords</a> executed. Under its leadership, China developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons. The Chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million.

<p>In 1976, Mao died. The <a href="/wiki/Gang_of_Four" title="Gang of Four">Gang of Four</a> was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.

Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the <a href="/wiki/River_delta" title="River delta">deltas</a> of China's two major rivers, the <a href="/wiki/Yellow_River" title="Yellow River">Yellow River</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yangtze_River" title="Yangtze River">Yangtze River</a>. Other major rivers include the <a href="/wiki/Xi_River" title="Xi River">Xi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mekong" title="Mekong">Mekong</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brahmaputra_River" title="Brahmaputra River">Brahmaputra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amur_River" title="Amur River">Amur</a>. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High <a href="/wiki/Plateau" title="Plateau">plateaus</a> feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the <a href="/wiki/Taklamakan_Desert" title="Taklamakan Desert">Taklamakan</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Gobi_Desert" title="Gobi Desert">Gobi Desert</a>. The world's highest point, <a href="/wiki/Mount_Everest" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a> (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border. The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of <a href="/wiki/Ayding_Lake" title="Ayding Lake">Ayding Lake</a> (−154m) in the <a href="/wiki/Turpan_Depression" title="Turpan Depression">Turpan Depression</a>.</p>
<p>China's climate is mainly dominated by <a href="/wiki/Dry_season" title="Dry season">dry seasons</a> and wet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monsoons" title="Monsoons">monsoons</a>, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex <a href="/wiki/Topography" title="Topography">topography</a>.</p>
<p>A major environmental issue in China is the continued <a href="/wiki/Desertification" title="Desertification">expansion of its deserts</a>, particularly the Gobi Desert. Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sandstorms" title="Sandstorms">sandstorms</a>, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asian_dust" title="Asian dust">dust storms</a> plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of east Asia, including Korea and Japan. China's environmental watchdog, <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Environmental_Protection_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China">SEPA</a>, stated in 2007 that China is losing a million acres (4,000 km²) per year to desertification. Water quality, <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pollution_in_China" title="Pollution in China">pollution control</a> have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glaciers" title="Glaciers">glaciers</a> in the Himalayas could potentially lead to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_shortage" title="Water shortage">water shortages</a> for hundreds of millions of people.</p>

It later produced a <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity_action_plan" title="Biodiversity action plan">National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan</a>, with one revision that was received by the convention on 21 September 2010.</p>
<p>China is home to at least 551 species of <a href="/wiki/List_of_mammals_of_China" title="List of mammals of China">mammals</a> (the third-highest such number in the world), 1,221 species of birds (eighth), 424 species of reptiles (seventh) and 333 species of amphibians (seventh).

At least 840 <a href="/wiki/List_of_endangered_and_protected_species_of_China" title="List of endangered and protected species of China">animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction</a> in China, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and ingredients for <a href="/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine" title="Traditional Chinese medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a>.

<p>China has over 32,000 species of vascular plants, and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coniferous" title="Coniferous">coniferous</a> forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as <a href="/wiki/Moose" title="Moose">moose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asian_black_bear" title="Asian black bear">Asian black bear</a>, along with over 120 bird species.

<p>In recent decades, China has suffered from <a href="/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_China" title="Environmental issues in China">severe environmental deterioration and pollution</a>. While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development. Urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country; the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> estimated in 2013 that 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities are located in China. China is the world's largest <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emitter. The country also has significant <a href="/wiki/Water_pollution" title="Water pollution">water pollution</a> problems: 40% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011. In 2014, the internal freshwater resources per capita of China reduced to 2,062m, and it was below 500m in the <a href="/wiki/North_China_Plain" title="North China Plain">North China Plain</a>, while 5,920m in the world.</p>
<p>However, China is the world's leading investor in <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization" title="Renewable energy commercialization">renewable energy commercialization</a>, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US$" title="US$">$</a>52 billion invested in 2011 alone; it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects. By 2009, over 17% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources – most notably <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a> plants, of which China has a total installed capacity of 197 GW. In 2011, the Chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan (US$619 billion) in water infrastructure and <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">desalination</a> projects over a ten-year period, and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought system by 2020. In 2013, China began a five-year, US$277 billion effort to reduce air pollution, particularly in the north of the country.</p>

<p>There have been some moves toward political liberalization, in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels. However, the Party retains effective control over government appointments: in the absence of meaningful opposition, the CPC wins by default most of the time. Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption. Nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high, with 80–95% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2011 survey.</p>

<p>The PRC has diplomatic relations with 173 countries and maintains <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="List of diplomatic missions of the People's Republic of China">embassies in 162</a>. Its <a href="/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)" title="Legitimacy (political)">legitimacy</a> is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries; it is thus the largest and most populous <a href="/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition" title="List of states with limited recognition">state with limited recognition</a>. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>. China was also a former member and leader of the <a href="/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement" title="Non-Aligned Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, and still considers itself an advocate for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a>. Along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of the <a href="/wiki/BRICS" title="BRICS">BRICS</a> group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2011_BRICS_summit" title="2011 BRICS summit">third official summit</a> at <a href="/wiki/Sanya" title="Sanya">Sanya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hainan" title="Hainan">Hainan</a> in April 2011.</p>
<p>Under its interpretation of the <a href="/wiki/One-China_policy" title="One-China policy">One-China policy</a>, Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China. Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan, especially in the matter of armament sales.</p>
<p>Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier <a href="/wiki/Zhou_Enlai" title="Zhou Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Five_Principles_of_Peaceful_Coexistence" title="Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence">Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence</a>, and is also driven by the concept of "harmony without uniformity", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. This policy may have led China to support states that are <a href="/wiki/Rogue_state" title="Rogue state">regarded as dangerous</a> or repressive by Western nations, such as <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, North Korea and <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>. China has a close economic and military relationship with Russia, and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Trade_relations">Trade relations</span></h4>
<p>In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_trade_area" title="Free trade area">free trade areas</a> and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new <a href="/wiki/East_Asia_Summit" title="East Asia Summit">East Asia Summit</a> (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues. The EAS, which includes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ASEAN_Plus_Three" title="ASEAN Plus Three">ASEAN Plus Three</a>, India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics.

<p>Ever since its establishment after the second <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a>, the PRC has been claiming <a href="/wiki/Free_area_of_the_Republic_of_China" title="Free area of the Republic of China">the territories</a> governed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory, which includes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Island_of_Taiwan" title="Island of Taiwan">island of Taiwan</a> as <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_Province,_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China">Taiwan Province</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kinmen" title="Kinmen">Kinmen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Matsu_Islands" title="Matsu Islands">Matsu</a> as a part of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fujian_Province" title="Fujian Province">Fujian Province</a> and islands the ROC controls in the <a href="/wiki/South_China_Sea" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a> as a part of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hainan_Province" title="Hainan Province">Hainan Province</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guangdong_Province" title="Guangdong Province">Guangdong Province</a>.

<p>In addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes.

<p>China is regularly hailed as a <a href="/wiki/Potential_superpowers" title="Potential superpowers">potential new superpower</a>, with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress, growing military might, very large population, and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Century" title="Chinese Century">prominent global role</a> in the 21st century. Others, however, warn that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic_bubbles" title="Economic bubbles">economic bubbles</a> and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt China's growth as the century progresses. Some authors also question the definition of "superpower", arguing that China's large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower, and noting that it lacks the military and cultural influence of the United States.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Chinese_democracy_movement" title="Chinese democracy movement">Chinese democracy movement</a>, social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, <a href="/wiki/Political_freedom" title="Political freedom">political freedom</a> is still tightly restricted. The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Constitution of the People's Republic of China">Constitution of the People's Republic of China</a> states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press" title="Freedom of the press">freedom of the press</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial" title="Right to a fair trial">right to a fair trial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" title="Freedom of religion">freedom of religion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage" title="Universal suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property rights</a>. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state. Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party" title="Chinese Communist Party">Communist Party</a> are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet, are routinely used to prevent collective action. In 2005, <a href="/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders" title="Reporters Without Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a> ranked China 159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index, indicating a very low level of press freedom. In 2014, China ranked 175th out of 180 countries.</p>
<p>Rural migrants to China's cities often find themselves treated as <a href="/wiki/Second-class_citizen" title="Second-class citizen">second-class citizens</a> by the <i>hukou</i> <a href="/wiki/Hukou_system" title="Hukou system">household registration</a> system, which controls access to <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">state benefits</a>. Property rights are often poorly protected, and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens. However, a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s, and additional social services provided to rural dwellers.</p>
<p>A number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NGO" title="NGO">NGOs</a> also routinely criticize <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Human rights in the People's Republic of China">China's human rights record</a>, alleging widespread <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civil_rights" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> violations such as detention without trial, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forced_abortions" title="Forced abortions">forced abortions</a>, forced confessions, <a href="/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a>, restrictions of fundamental rights, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Capital punishment in the People's Republic of China">excessive use of the death penalty</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Falun_Gong" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> was first taught publicly in 1992. In 1999, when there were 70 million practitioners, the <a href="/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong" title="Persecution of Falun Gong">persecution of Falun Gong</a> began, resulting in mass arrests, extralegal detention, and reports of torture and deaths in custody. The Chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in <a href="/wiki/Tibet" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and <a href="/wiki/Xinjiang" title="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>, including violent police crackdowns and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_suppression" title="Religious suppression">religious suppression</a>.</p>

Furthermore, some Chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization, although <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chinese_skepticism_of_democracy" title="Chinese skepticism of democracy">others remain more conservative</a>. Some major reform efforts have been conducted; for an instance in November 2013, the government announced plans to relax the one-child policy and abolish the much-criticized <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Re-education_through_labour" title="Re-education through labour">re-education through labour</a> program, though human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic. During the 2000s and early 2010s, the Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical, efficient solutions to social problems, but such "third sector" activity remained heavily regulated.</p>

Inefficient <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government-owned_corporation" title="Government-owned corporation">state-owned enterprises</a> (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses.

<p>Since economic liberalization began in 1978, China has been among the world's fastest-growing economies, relying largely on investment- and export-led growth. According to the IMF, China's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Annual_average_GDP_growth" title="Annual average GDP growth">annual average GDP growth</a> between 2001 and 2010 was 10.5%.

<p>China was a world leader in science and technology until the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ming_Dynasty" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>. Ancient <a href="/wiki/List_of_Chinese_discoveries" title="List of Chinese discoveries">Chinese discoveries</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Chinese_inventions" title="List of Chinese inventions">inventions</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Papermaking" title="Papermaking">papermaking</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/History_of_typography_in_East_Asia" title="History of typography in East Asia">printing</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Compass" title="Compass">compass</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Four_Great_Inventions" title="Four Great Inventions">Four Great Inventions</a>), later became widespread in Asia and Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Negative_numbers#History" title="Negative numbers">negative numbers</a>. However, by the 17th century, the Western world had surpassed China in scientific and technological development. The causes of this <a href="/wiki/Great_Divergence" title="Great Divergence">Great Divergence</a> continue to be debated.</p>
<p>After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the <a href="/wiki/Self-Strengthening_Movement" title="Self-Strengthening Movement">Self-Strengthening Movement</a>. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, in which scientific research was part of central planning. After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the <a href="/wiki/Four_Modernizations" title="Four Modernizations">Four Modernizations</a>, and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_era">Modern era</span></h3>
<p>Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research, with $163 billion spent on scientific research and development in 2012. Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China's economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as "techno-nationalism". Nonetheless, China's investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the United States and Japan. Chinese-born scientists have won the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> four times, the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize in Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine" title="Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine">Physiology or Medicine</a> once respectively, though most of these scientists conducted their Nobel-winning research in western nations.</p>

<p>China is rapidly developing its education system with an emphasis on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/STEM_fields" title="STEM fields">science, mathematics and engineering</a>; in 2009, it produced over 10,000 Ph.D. engineering graduates, and as many as 500,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BSc" title="BSc">BSc</a> graduates, more than any other country. China is also the world's second-largest publisher of <a href="/wiki/Academic_publishing_in_China" title="Academic publishing in China">scientific papers</a>, producing 121,500 in 2010 alone, including 5,200 in leading international scientific journals. Chinese technology companies such as <a href="/wiki/Huawei" title="Huawei">Huawei</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lenovo" title="Lenovo">Lenovo</a> have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing, and Chinese <a href="/wiki/Supercomputer" title="Supercomputer">supercomputers</a> are consistently ranked among the <a href="/wiki/TOP500" title="TOP500">world's most powerful</a>. China is furthermore experiencing a significant growth in the use of industrial <a href="/wiki/Robot" title="Robot">robots</a>; from 2008 to 2011, the installation of multi-role robots in Chinese factories rose by 136 percent.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Chinese_space_program" title="Chinese space program">Chinese space program</a> is one of the world's most active, and is a major source of national pride. In 1970, China launched its first satellite, <a href="/wiki/Dong_Fang_Hong_I" title="Dong Fang Hong I">Dong Fang Hong I</a>, becoming the fifth country to do so independently. In 2003, China became the third country to independently send humans into space, with <a href="/wiki/Yang_Liwei" title="Yang Liwei">Yang Liwei</a>'s spaceflight aboard <a href="/wiki/Shenzhou_5" title="Shenzhou 5">Shenzhou 5</a>; as of 2015, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Chinese_astronauts" title="List of Chinese astronauts">ten Chinese nationals</a> have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China's first space station module, <a href="/wiki/Tiangong-1" title="Tiangong-1">Tiangong-1</a>, was launched, marking the first step in a project to assemble <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chinese_space_station" title="Chinese space station">a large manned station</a> by the early 2020s.

<p>China has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production" title="List of countries by motor vehicle production">production</a>. Auto sales in 2009 exceeded 13.6 million and may reach 40 million by 2020. A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents, with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as a possible cause—in 2011 alone, around 62,000 Chinese died in road accidents. In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2012, there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sixth_National_Population_Census_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China">national census of 2010</a> recorded the population of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.</p>
<p>Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has <a href="/wiki/Poverty_in_China" title="Poverty in China">pulled hundreds of millions</a> of its people out of poverty since 1978. Today, about 10% of the Chinese population lives below the poverty line of US$1 per day, down from 64% in 1978. In 2014, the urban unemployment rate of China was about 4.1%.</p>
<p>With a population of over 1.3 billion and dwindling natural resources, the government of China is very concerned about its population growth rate and has attempted since 1979, with mixed results, to implement a strict <a href="/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning">family planning</a> policy, known as the "<a href="/wiki/One-child_policy" title="One-child policy">one-child policy</a>." Before 2013, this policy sought to restrict families to one child each, with exceptions for ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas. A major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child. The government is now dropping the one-child policy in favor of a <a href="/wiki/Two-child_policy" title="Two-child policy">two-child policy</a>. Data from the 2010 census implies that the <a href="/wiki/Total_fertility_rate" title="Total fertility rate">total fertility rate</a> may now be around 1.4.</p>

<p>The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may be contributing to an imbalance in the <a href="/wiki/Human_sex_ratio" title="Human sex ratio">sex ratio</a> at birth. According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls, which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls. The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population.

<p>China has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 50% in 2014. It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one billion by 2030, potentially equivalent to one-eighth of the world population. As of 2012, there are more than 262 million <a href="/wiki/Migrant_worker" title="Migrant worker">migrant workers</a> in China, mostly rural migrants seeking work in cities.</p>
<p>China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million, including the seven <a href="/wiki/Megacity" title="Megacity">megacities</a> (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Wuhan.

<p>Since 1986, compulsory education in China comprises <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" title="Primary school">primary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Middle_school" title="Middle school">junior secondary school</a>, which together last for nine years. In 2010, about 82.5 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gaokao" title="Gaokao">Gaokao</a>, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. In 2010, 27 percent of secondary school graduates are enrolled in higher education. Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and <a href="/wiki/Tertiary_education" title="Tertiary education">tertiary</a> level.</p>
<p>In February 2006, the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and fees. Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$250 billion in 2011. However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥20,023, while in <a href="/wiki/Guizhou" title="Guizhou">Guizhou</a>, one of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_GDP_per_capita" title="List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita">poorest provinces in China</a>, only totalled ¥3,204. Free compulsory education in China consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6 and 15. In 2011, around 81.4% of Chinese have received secondary education. By 2007, there were 396,567 primary schools, 94,116 secondary schools, and 2,236 higher education institutions in China.</p>
<p>As of 2010, 94% of the population over age 15 are literate, compared to only 20% in 1950. In 2009, Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the <a href="/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment" title="Programme for International Student Assessment">Programme for International Student Assessment</a> (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance. Despite the high results, Chinese education has also faced <a href="/wiki/Education_in_China#Criticism" title="Education in China">both native and international criticism</a> for its emphasis on rote memorization and its gap in quality from rural to urban areas.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Health_and_Family_Planning_Commission" title="National Health and Family Planning Commission">National Health and Family Planning Commission</a>, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population. An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the <a href="/wiki/Patriotic_Health_Campaign" title="Patriotic Health Campaign">Patriotic Health Campaign</a>, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases.

After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly <a href="/wiki/Private_healthcare" title="Private healthcare">privatized</a>, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion. By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage. In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceuticals" title="Pharmaceuticals">pharmaceuticals</a>, but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of <a href="/wiki/Counterfeit_medications" title="Counterfeit medications">counterfeit medications</a>.</p>

<p>Demographically, the most widespread religious tradition is the "Chinese religion", which comprehends Confucian and Taoist modalities, and consists in allegiance to the <i><a href="/wiki/Shen_(Chinese_religion)" title="Shen (Chinese religion)">shen</a></i> (神), a character that signifies the "<a href="/wiki/Chinese_gods_and_immortals" title="Chinese gods and immortals">energies of generation</a>", who can be <a href="/wiki/Deity" title="Deity">deities</a> of the natural environment or <a href="/wiki/Progenitor" title="Progenitor">ancestral principles</a> of human groups, concepts of civility, <a href="/wiki/Culture_hero" title="Culture hero">culture heroes</a>, many of whom feature in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_mythology" title="Chinese mythology">Chinese mythology</a> and history. Among the most popular <a href="/wiki/Cult_(religious_practice)" title="Cult (religious practice)">folk cults</a> are those of <a href="/wiki/Mazu_(goddess)" title="Mazu (goddess)">Mazu</a> (goddess of the seas), <a href="/wiki/Yellow_Emperor" title="Yellow Emperor">Huangdi</a> (one of the two <a href="/wiki/Yan_Huang_Zisun" title="Yan Huang Zisun">divine patriarchs</a> of the Chinese race), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guandi" title="Guandi">Guandi</a> (god of war and business), <a href="/wiki/Caishen" title="Caishen">Caishen</a> (god of prosperity and richness), <a href="/wiki/Pangu" title="Pangu">Pangu</a> and many others.

A 2015 poll conducted by <a href="/wiki/WIN/GIA" title="WIN/GIA">Gallup International</a> found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as "convinced atheist", but this result may be due to the poll's Western criterion in defining what is a "religion". Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between religions, especially Buddhism, Taoism and local folk religious practice. The important <a href="/wiki/Sinology" title="Sinology">sinologist</a> John Lagerwey clearly defines China as "a religious state".</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_China#Statistics" title="Religion in China">most recent demographic analyses</a>, an average 80% of the Chinese population practice some form of Chinese folk religions, Taoism and Confucianism. Approximately 10—16% are Buddhists, 2—4% are Christians, and 1—2% are Muslims.

<p>Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and conservative philosophies. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious <a href="/wiki/Imperial_examination" title="Imperial examination">imperial examinations</a>, which have their origins in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Han_Dynasty" title="Han Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Chinese_literature" title="Chinese literature">literary emphasis</a> of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that <a href="/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy" title="Chinese calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Classical_Chinese_poetry" title="Classical Chinese poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chinese_painting" title="Chinese painting">painting</a> were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective. Examinations and a <a href="/wiki/Meritocracy" title="Meritocracy">culture of merit</a> remain greatly valued in China today.</p>
<p>The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the <a href="/wiki/May_Fourth_Movement" title="May Fourth Movement">May Fourth Movement</a> and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, <a href="/wiki/Sexism" title="Sexism">sexism</a>, and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Revolution" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a>". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like <a href="/wiki/Peking_opera" title="Peking opera">Peking opera</a>, were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.</p>
<p>Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of <a href="/wiki/Chinese_nationalism" title="Chinese nationalism">Chinese nationalism</a> and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival, and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.
