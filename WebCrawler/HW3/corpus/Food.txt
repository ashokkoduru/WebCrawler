<p>Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. <a href="/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">Cereal</a> grain is a <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple food</a> that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop. <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">Corn (maize)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.</p>
<p>Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Mushroom" title="Mushroom">mushrooms</a>.

<p>Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. Many of these plant species have several distinct <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">Seeds</a> of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Omega-3" title="Omega-3">Omega fats</a>. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods.

<p><a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">Fruits</a> are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants and animals have <a href="/wiki/Coevolution" title="Coevolution">coevolved</a> such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may <a href="/wiki/Excretion" title="Excretion">excrete</a> the seeds some distance away.

<p>Most food has always been obtained through <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. With increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_agriculture" title="Industrial agriculture">industrial agriculture</a>, there has been a growing trend toward <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture" title="Sustainable agriculture">sustainable agricultural</a> practices. This approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, local self-reliance and <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a> methods. Major influences on food production include international organizations (e.g. the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agricultural Policy</a>), national government policy (or law), and war.</p>
<p>In popular culture, the mass production of food, specifically meats such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chicken_(food)" title="Chicken (food)">chicken</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a>, has come under fire from various <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentaries</a>, most recently <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food,_Inc" title="Food, Inc">Food, Inc</a>, documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals, often for easier revenues from <a href="/wiki/Corporate_farming" title="Corporate farming">large corporations</a>. Along with a current trend towards <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a>, people in <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western culture</a> have had an increasing trend towards the use of <a href="/wiki/Herbalism" title="Herbalism">herbal supplements</a>, foods for a specific group of people (such as dieters, women, or athletes), <a href="/wiki/Functional_food" title="Functional food">functional foods</a> (fortified foods, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Omega-3" title="Omega-3">omega-3</a> eggs), and a more ethnically diverse diet.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Taste" title="Taste">Taste</a></div>
<p>Animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sweet" title="Sweet">sweet</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sour" title="Sour">sour</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saltiness" title="Saltiness">salty</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitter_(taste)" title="Bitter (taste)">bitter</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Umami" title="Umami">umami</a>. As animals have <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolved</a>, the tastes that provide the most energy (<a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fats</a>) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitter_(taste)" title="Bitter (taste)">bitter</a>, are not enjoyable. Water, while important for survival, has no taste. Fats, on the other hand, especially <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fats</a>, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sweet">Sweet</span></h3>

<p>Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, <a href="/wiki/Sweetness" title="Sweetness">sweetness</a> is almost always caused by a type of simple <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> or <a href="/wiki/Fructose" title="Fructose">fructose</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disaccharides" title="Disaccharides">disaccharides</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, a molecule combining glucose and fructose. Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as <a href="/wiki/Sucralose" title="Sucralose">sucralose</a> are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Raw_sugar" title="Raw sugar">raw sugar</a>, which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Stevia" title="Stevia">stevia</a> plant contains a compound known as <a href="/wiki/Steviol" title="Steviol">steviol</a> which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sour">Sour</span></h3>
<p>Sourness is caused by the taste of <a href="/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acids</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include <a href="/wiki/Citrus" title="Citrus">citrus</a>, specifically <a href="/wiki/Lemon" title="Lemon">lemons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lime_(fruit)" title="Lime (fruit)">limes</a>, and to a lesser degree <a href="/wiki/Orange_(fruit)" title="Orange (fruit)">oranges</a>. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rancidity" title="Rancidity">rancid</a> due to bacteria. Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Salty">Salty</span></h3>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saltiness" title="Saltiness">Saltiness</a> is the taste of <a href="/wiki/Alkali_metal" title="Alkali metal">alkali metal</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ions" title="Ions">ions</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a>. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including <a href="/wiki/Sea_salt" title="Sea salt">sea salt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fleur_de_sel" title="Fleur de sel">fleur de sel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kosher_salt" title="Kosher salt">kosher salt</a>, mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate <a href="/wiki/Electrolyte" title="Electrolyte">electrolyte</a> balance, which is the <a href="/wiki/Kidney" title="Kidney">kidney</a>'s function. Salt may be iodized, meaning <a href="/wiki/Iodine" title="Iodine">iodine</a> has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes <a href="/wiki/Thyroid" title="Thyroid">thyroid</a> function. Some canned foods, notably <a href="/wiki/Soup" title="Soup">soups</a> or packaged <a href="/wiki/Broth" title="Broth">broths</a>, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bitter">Bitter</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitter_(taste)" title="Bitter (taste)">Bitterness</a> is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste.

<p>Many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a> traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as <a href="/wiki/Gastronomy" title="Gastronomy">gastronomy</a>. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.</p>

Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of <a href="/wiki/Taste" title="Taste">taste</a>, the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Food_presentation" title="Food presentation">Food presentation</a></div>
<p>Aesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people "eat with their eyes". Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Contrast_in_texture">Contrast in texture</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Texture_(food)" title="Texture (food)">Texture</a> plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding <a href="/wiki/Granola" title="Granola">granola</a> to <a href="/wiki/Yogurt" title="Yogurt">yogurt</a>, adding <a href="/wiki/Crouton" title="Crouton">croutons</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Salad" title="Salad">salad</a> or <a href="/wiki/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a>, and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Contrast_in_taste">Contrast in taste</span></h3>
<p>Another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as <a href="/wiki/Sweetness" title="Sweetness">sweetness</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saltiness" title="Saltiness">saltiness</a> tend to go well together, as in <a href="/wiki/Kettle_corn" title="Kettle corn">kettle corn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a>.</p>

In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slaughterhouses" title="Slaughterhouses">slaughterhouses</a>, which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> has established the <a href="/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Act" title="Humane Slaughter Act">Humane Slaughter Act</a> of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kosher" title="Kosher">kosher</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shechita" title="Shechita">shechita</a>, and dhabiĥa halal. Strict interpretations of <a href="/wiki/Kashrut" title="Kashrut">kashrut</a> require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.</p>
<p>On the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and <a href="/wiki/Seafood" title="Seafood">seafood</a> may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. However fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">Cooking</a></div>
<p>The term "cooking" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as <a href="/wiki/Culinary_art" title="Culinary art">culinary art</a>, generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, <a href="/wiki/Tool" title="Tool">tools</a>, and the skill of the individual cook. The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.</p>
<p>Cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, <a href="/wiki/Mouthfeel" title="Mouthfeel">texture</a>, appearance, and nutritional properties. Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at <i><a href="/wiki/Homo_erectus" title="Homo erectus">Homo erectus</a></i> campsites dating from 420,000 years ago. Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">pottery</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Cookware_and_bakeware" title="Cookware and bakeware">Cookware and bakeware</a></div>
<p>There are many different types of equipment used for cooking.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Oven" title="Oven">Ovens</a> are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to 500 °F) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a <a href="/wiki/Tandoor" title="Tandoor">Tandoor</a> oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature. Western kitchens use variable temperature <a href="/wiki/Convection_oven" title="Convection oven">convection ovens</a>, conventional ovens, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toaster_oven" title="Toaster oven">toaster ovens</a>, or non-radiant heat ovens like the <a href="/wiki/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave oven</a>. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">gas</a>, electric, or oil-fired.</p>
<p>Various types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saut%C3%A9_pan" title="Sauté pan">sauté pan</a>, sauce pot, <a href="/wiki/Frying_pan" title="Frying pan">frying pan</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pressure_cooker" title="Pressure cooker">pressure cooker</a>. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steaming</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simmer" title="Simmer">simmering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boil" title="Boil">boiling</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Poaching_(cooking)" title="Poaching (cooking)">poaching</a> for moist methods, while the dry methods include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saut%C3%A9" title="Sauté">sautéing</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pan_fry" title="Pan fry">pan frying</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deep-fry" title="Deep-fry">deep-frying</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grill_(cooking)" title="Grill (cooking)">grill</a> operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking. A <a href="/wiki/Mexican_cuisine" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican</a> style of barbecue is called <a href="/wiki/Barbacoa" title="Barbacoa">barbacoa</a>, which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Asado" title="Asado">asado</a> (Spanish for "grilled") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.</p>

<p>Restaurants employ trained <a href="/wiki/Chef" title="Chef">chefs</a> who prepare food, and trained waitstaff to serve the customers. The term <a href="/wiki/Restaurant" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a> is credited to the <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> from the 19th century, as it relates to the restorative nature of the <a href="/wiki/Bouillon_(broth)" title="Bouillon (broth)">bouillons</a> that were once served in them. However, the concept pre-dates the naming of these establishments, as evidence suggests commercial food preparation may have existed during the age of the city of <a href="/wiki/Pompeii" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Song_dynasty" title="Song dynasty">Song dynasty</a>.

<p>Packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a <a href="/wiki/Butcher" title="Butcher">butcher</a> preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international <a href="/wiki/Food_industry" title="Food industry">food industry</a>.

It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.</p>
<p>At the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food <a href="/wiki/Brand" title="Brand">brands</a>. There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies. Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the USA and Japan. <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>'s need for food was especially well illustrated in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>.

<p>Food is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marketing_and_retailing">Marketing and retailing</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Food_marketing" title="Food marketing">Food marketing</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Food_marketing" title="Food marketing">Food marketing</a> brings together the producer and the consumer. It is the chain of activities that brings food from "farm gate to plate". The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one <a href="/wiki/Canning" title="Canning">can</a> of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans. The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.</p>
<p>In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grocer" title="Grocer">grocers</a> for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers. With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, <a href="/wiki/Supermarket" title="Supermarket">supermarkets</a> were born. Supermarkets brought with them a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self_service" title="Self service">self service</a> approach to shopping using <a href="/wiki/Shopping_cart" title="Shopping cart">shopping carts</a>, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.</p>
<p>Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large <a href="/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">companies</a> control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to <a href="/wiki/Advertising" title="Advertising">advertising</a>, transportation, and intermediate corporations.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prices">Prices</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_world_food_price_crisis" title="2007–2008 world food price crisis">2007–2008 world food price crisis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Food_vs._fuel" title="Food vs. fuel">Food vs. fuel</a></div>
<p>It was reported on March 24, 2008, that consumers worldwide faced rising food prices. Reasons for this development include changes in the weather and dramatic changes in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_economy" title="Global economy">global economy</a>, including higher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_price" title="Oil price">oil prices</a>, lower food reserves, and growing consumer demand in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. In the long term, prices are expected to stabilize. Farmers will grow more grain for both <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a> and food and eventually bring prices down. Already this is happening with <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, with more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crops" title="Crops">crops</a> to be planted in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> in 2009. However, the <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018.</p>

<p>It is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of <a href="/wiki/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.</p>
<p>Food prices are rising, wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry. The trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing, as well as global cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery manufacturing, forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Spring" title="Arab Spring">Arab Spring</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013 <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> researchers showed that <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.</p>

This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations. Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> futures. According to <a href="/wiki/Olivier_De_Schutter" title="Olivier De Schutter">Olivier De Schutter</a>, the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/George_W_Bush" title="George W Bush">George W Bush</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commodities_Futures_Modernization_Act" title="Commodities Futures Modernization Act">Commodities Futures Modernization Act</a> of 2000. De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: "What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a>; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand." In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the <a href="/wiki/G20" title="G20">G20</a> to regulate the commodities market more.</p>
<p>Some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, competition with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bio-fuels" title="Bio-fuels">bio-fuels</a> and overall rising demand. However, some such as <a href="/wiki/Jayati_Ghosh" title="Jayati Ghosh">Jayati Ghosh</a>, professor of economics at <a href="/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University,_Delhi" title="Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_Delhi" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: Ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from June to December 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.</p>

Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version. The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as "foreign bodies") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.</p>

The sale of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rancidity" title="Rancidity">rancid</a>, contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygiene</a>, refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbiological" title="Microbiological">microbiological</a> studies by scientists such as <a href="/wiki/Louis_Pasteur" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of <a href="/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig" title="Justus von Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a>, which led to the development of modern <a href="/wiki/Food_storage" title="Food storage">food storage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">food preservation</a> methods. In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hazard_Analysis_and_Critical_Control_Points" title="Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points">Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HACCP" title="HACCP">HACCP</a>), which can identify and eliminate many risks.</p>
<p>Recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.</p>
<p>Foods that spoil easily, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meats" title="Meats">meats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dairy" title="Dairy">dairy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Seafood" title="Seafood">seafood</a>, must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Salmonella" title="Salmonella">Salmonella</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Escherichia_coli" title="Escherichia coli">E. coli</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Allergies">Allergies</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Food_allergy" title="Food allergy">Food allergy</a></div>
<p>Some people have <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Allergies" title="Allergies">allergies</a> or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune system</a> mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy. The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are <a href="/wiki/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shellfish" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a> (mollusks), <a href="/wiki/Peanut" title="Peanut">peanuts</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soy" title="Soy">soy</a>. Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rash" title="Rash">rashes</a>, bloating, <a href="/wiki/Vomiting" title="Vomiting">vomiting</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)" title="Regurgitation (digestion)">regurgitation</a>. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the <a href="/wiki/Allergen" title="Allergen">allergen</a>.</p>
<p>Rarely, food allergies can lead to a <a href="/wiki/Medical_emergency" title="Medical emergency">medical emergency</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anaphylactic_shock" title="Anaphylactic shock">anaphylactic shock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hypotension" title="Hypotension">hypotension</a> (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although <a href="/wiki/Latex" title="Latex">latex</a> products can induce similar reactions. Initial treatment is with <a href="/wiki/Epinephrine" title="Epinephrine">epinephrine</a> (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Epi-pen" title="Epi-pen">Epi-pen</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Twinject" title="Twinject">Twinject</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_health_issues">Other health issues</span></h3>
<p>Human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of <a href="/wiki/Diet_and_cancer" title="Diet and cancer">cancers</a> in a human epidemiological analysis by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Doll" title="Richard Doll">Richard Doll</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Peto" title="Richard Peto">Richard Peto</a> in 1981. These cancer may be caused by <a href="/wiki/Carcinogen" title="Carcinogen">carcinogens</a> that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain <a href="/wiki/Mycotoxin" title="Mycotoxin">mycotoxins</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aflatoxins" title="Aflatoxins">aflatoxins</a> which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts. Other carcinogens identified in food include <a href="/wiki/Heterocyclic_amine" title="Heterocyclic amine">heterocyclic amines</a> generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyaromatic_hydrocarbon" title="Polyaromatic hydrocarbon">polyaromatic hydrocarbons</a> in charred meat and smoked fish, and <a href="/wiki/Nitrosamine" title="Nitrosamine">nitrosamines</a> generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cured_meat" title="Cured meat">cured meat</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Bacon" title="Bacon">bacon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Anticarcinogen" title="Anticarcinogen">Anticarcinogens</a> that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruits and vegetable. <a href="/wiki/Antioxidant" title="Antioxidant">Antioxidants</a> are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_and_religious_diets">Cultural and religious diets</span></h3>
<p>Dietary habits are the habitual decisions a person or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. Many cultures hold some food preferences and some food <a href="/wiki/Taboo" title="Taboo">taboos</a>. Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kosher" title="Kosher">kosher foods</a> are permitted by <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Halal" title="Halal">halal</a> foods by <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a> is restricted.

<p>Dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adipose" title="Adipose">adipose</a> tissue, known as body fat. Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, <a href="/wiki/Iodine_deficiency" title="Iodine deficiency">iodine deficiency</a>. It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_A" title="Vitamin A">vitamin A</a> deficiency. <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_C" title="Vitamin C">Vitamin C</a> deficiency results in <a href="/wiki/Scurvy" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>. <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">Calcium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_D" title="Vitamin D">Vitamin D</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. <a href="/wiki/Kwashiorkor" title="Kwashiorkor">Kwashiorkor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marasmus" title="Marasmus">marasmus</a> are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Moral.2C_ethical.2C_and_health-conscious_diets">Moral, ethical, and health-conscious diets</span></h3>
<p>Many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. For instance, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vegetarian" title="Vegetarian">vegetarians</a> choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a <a href="/wiki/Healthy_diet" title="Healthy diet">healthier diet</a>, avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and <a href="/wiki/Antioxidant" title="Antioxidant">antioxidants</a>. <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">Obesity</a>, a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heart_disease" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diabetes" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a>, and many other diseases. More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_food" title="Genetically modified food">genetically modified food</a>. Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming (<a href="/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">grains</a>) on <a href="/wiki/Animal_welfare" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a>, human health, and the <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">environment</a> are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutrition_and_dietary_problems">Nutrition and dietary problems</span></h2>

<p>Between the extremes of optimal health and death from <a href="/wiki/Starvation" title="Starvation">starvation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as <a href="/wiki/Scurvy" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Osteoporosis" title="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2" title="Diabetes mellitus type 2">diabetes</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cardiovascular_diseases" title="Cardiovascular diseases">cardiovascular diseases</a> as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.</p>
<p>Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the <a href="/wiki/Mineral_(nutrient)" title="Mineral (nutrient)">minerals</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vitamins" title="Vitamins">vitamins</a>. Additionally, food contains water and <a href="/wiki/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">dietary fiber</a>.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, the body is designed by <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunters and gatherers</a>. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" title="Biotechnology">advanced technology</a>, enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">obesity</a> in adults and children alike.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_definition">Legal definition</span></h2>
<p>Some countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word <i>foodstuff</i>. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a>. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, <a href="/wiki/Chewing_gum" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a>, water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include <a href="/wiki/Pet_food" title="Pet food">animal feed</a>, live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, <a href="/wiki/Cosmetics" title="Cosmetics">cosmetics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> and tobacco products, <a href="/wiki/Narcotic" title="Narcotic">narcotic</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Psychotropic_substance" title="Psychotropic substance">psychotropic substances</a>, and residues and contaminants.</p>
