<p>A <b>river</b> is a natural flowing <a href="/wiki/Watercourse" title="Watercourse">watercourse</a>, usually <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater">freshwater</a>, flowing towards an <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">ocean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lake" title="Lake">lake</a> or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as <a href="/wiki/Stream" title="Stream">stream</a>, creek, brook, rivulet, and <a href="/wiki/Rill" title="Rill">rill</a>. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to <a href="/wiki/Geographical_feature" title="Geographical feature">geographic features</a>, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Burn_(topography)" title="Burn (topography)">burn</a>" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.</p>
<p>Rivers are part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrological_cycle" title="Hydrological cycle">hydrological cycle</a>. Water generally collects in a river from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a> through a <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">drainage basin</a> from <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" title="Surface runoff">surface runoff</a> and other sources such as <a href="/wiki/Groundwater_recharge" title="Groundwater recharge">groundwater recharge</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)" title="Spring (hydrosphere)">springs</a>, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g. from <a href="/wiki/Glacier" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>).

<p>A river begins at a <a href="/wiki/River_source" title="River source">source</a> (or more often several sources), follows a path called a course, and ends at a <a href="/wiki/River_mouth" title="River mouth">mouth</a> or mouths. The water in a river is usually confined to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stream_channel" title="Stream channel">channel</a>, made up of a <a href="/wiki/Stream_bed" title="Stream bed">stream bed</a> between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stream_bank" title="Stream bank">banks</a>. In larger rivers there is often also a wider <a href="/wiki/Floodplain" title="Floodplain">floodplain</a> shaped by <a href="/wiki/Flood" title="Flood">flood</a>-waters over-topping the channel. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Floodplains" title="Floodplains">Floodplains</a> may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred, especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry.</p>
<p>Rivers can flow down mountains, through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valleys" title="Valleys">valleys</a> (<a href="/wiki/Depression_(geology)" title="Depression (geology)">depressions</a>) or along <a href="/wiki/Plain" title="Plain">plains</a>, and can create <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canyons" title="Canyons">canyons</a> or gorges.</p>
<p>The term upriver (or upstream) refers to the direction towards the source of the river, i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downriver (or downstream) describes the direction towards the mouth of the river, in which the <a href="/wiki/Current_(stream)" title="Current (stream)">current</a> flows.</p>
<p>The term left bank refers to the left bank in the direction of flow, right bank to the right.</p>
<p>The river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a <a href="/wiki/Braided_river" title="Braided river">braided river</a>. Extensive braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide, such as the <a href="/wiki/South_Island" title="South Island">South Island</a> of <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. They also occur on <a href="/wiki/Peneplain" title="Peneplain">peneplains</a> and some of the larger river deltas. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anastomosing_stream" title="Anastomosing stream">Anastamosing rivers</a> are similar to braided rivers and are also quite rare. They have multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes of sediment. There are rare cases of <a href="/wiki/River_bifurcation" title="River bifurcation">river bifurcation</a> in which a river divides and the resultant flows ending in different seas. An example is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bifurcation_of_Nerodime_River" title="Bifurcation of Nerodime River">bifurcation of Nerodime River</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kosovo" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>.</p>

<p>A river flowing in its channel is a source of energy which acts on the river channel to change its shape and form. In 1757, the German hydrologist <a href="/wiki/Albert_Brahms" title="Albert Brahms">Albert Brahms</a> empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed. This formulation is also sometimes called Airy's law. Thus, if the speed of flow is doubled, the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight. In mountainous torrential zones this can be seen as erosion channels through hard rocks and the creation of sands and gravels from the destruction of larger rocks. In U-shaped <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glaciated" title="Glaciated">glaciated</a> valleys, the subsequent river valley can often easily be identified by the V-shaped channel that it has carved. In the middle reaches where a river flows over flatter land, <a href="/wiki/Meander" title="Meander">meanders</a> may form through erosion of the river banks and deposition on the inside of bends. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an <a href="/wiki/Oxbow_lake" title="Oxbow lake">oxbow lake</a> or <a href="/wiki/Billabong" title="Billabong">billabong</a>. Rivers that carry large amounts of <a href="/wiki/Sediment" title="Sediment">sediment</a> may develop conspicuous <a href="/wiki/River_delta" title="River delta">deltas</a> at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline <a href="/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">tidal</a> waters may form <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuaries</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the free water flow together with a substantial volume flowing through sub-surface rocks and gravels that underlie the river and its <a href="/wiki/Floodplain" title="Floodplain">floodplain</a> (called the <a href="/wiki/Hyporheic_zone" title="Hyporheic zone">hyporheic zone</a>). For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subsurface_streams">Subsurface streams</span></h3>
<p>Most but not all rivers flow on the surface. <a href="/wiki/Subterranean_river" title="Subterranean river">Subterranean rivers</a> flow underground in <a href="/wiki/Cave" title="Cave">caves</a> or caverns. Such rivers are frequently found in regions with <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geologic_formation" title="Geologic formation">geologic formations</a>. <a href="/wiki/Subglacial_stream" title="Subglacial stream">Subglacial streams</a> are the braided rivers that flow at the beds of glaciers and <a href="/wiki/Ice_sheet" title="Ice sheet">ice sheets</a>, permitting meltwater to be discharged at the front of the glacier. Because of the gradient in <a href="/wiki/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a> due to the overlying weight of the glacier, such streams can even flow uphill.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Permanence_of_flow">Permanence of flow</span></h3>
<p>An <i><b>intermittent river</b></i> (or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ephemeral" title="Ephemeral">ephemeral</a> river) only flows occasionally and can be dry for several years at a time. These rivers are found in regions with limited or highly variable rainfall, or can occur because of geologic conditions such as a highly permeable river bed. Some ephemeral rivers flow during the summer months but not in the winter. Such rivers are typically fed from chalk aquifers which recharge from winter rainfall. In England these rivers are called <i>bournes</i> and give their name to places such as <a href="/wiki/Bournemouth" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastbourne" title="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>. Even in humid regions, the location where flow begins in the smallest tributary streams generally moves upstream in response to precipitation and downstream in its absence or when active summer vegetation diverts water for <a href="/wiki/Evapotranspiration" title="Evapotranspiration">evapotranspiration</a>. Normally-dry rivers in arid zones are often identified as <a href="/wiki/Arroyo_(creek)" title="Arroyo (creek)">arroyos</a> or other regional names.</p>
<p>The meltwater from large hailstorms can create a <a href="/wiki/Slurry" title="Slurry">slurry</a> of water, hail and sand or soil, forming temporary rivers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>


<p>Rivers have been classified by many criteria including their <a href="/wiki/Topography" title="Topography">topography</a>, their <a href="/wiki/Biotic_component" title="Biotic component">biotic</a> status, and their relevance to white water <a href="/wiki/Rafting" title="Rafting">rafting</a> or <a href="/wiki/Canoe" title="Canoe">canoeing</a> activities.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Topographical_classification">Topographical classification</span></h3>
<p>Rivers can generally be classified as either <a href="/wiki/Alluvial_river" title="Alluvial river">alluvial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bedrock_river" title="Bedrock river">bedrock</a>, or some mix of the two. Alluvial rivers have channels and floodplains that are self-formed in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sediments. They <a href="/wiki/Bank_erosion" title="Bank erosion">erode</a> their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Streambank" title="Streambank">banks</a> and deposit material on <a href="/wiki/Bar_(river_morphology)" title="Bar (river morphology)">bars</a> and their <a href="/wiki/Floodplain" title="Floodplain">floodplains</a>. Bedrock rivers form when the river downcuts through the modern sediments and into the underlying bedrock. This occurs in regions that have experienced some kind of uplift (thereby steepening river gradients) or in which a particular hard <a href="/wiki/Lithology" title="Lithology">lithology</a> causes a river to have a steepened reach that has not been covered in modern <a href="/wiki/Alluvium" title="Alluvium">alluvium</a>. Bedrock rivers very often contain alluvium on their beds; this material is important in eroding and sculpting the channel. Rivers that go through patches of bedrock and patches of deep alluvial cover are classified as mixed bedrock-alluvial.</p>
<p>Alluvial rivers can be further classified by their <a href="/wiki/Channel_pattern" title="Channel pattern">channel pattern</a> as meandering, braided, wandering, anastomose, or straight. The morphology of an alluvial river reach is controlled by a combination of sediment supply, substrate composition, discharge, vegetation, and bed <a href="/wiki/Aggradation" title="Aggradation">aggradation</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the 20th century <a href="/wiki/William_Morris_Davis" title="William Morris Davis">William Morris Davis</a> devised the "<a href="/wiki/Cycle_of_erosion" title="Cycle of erosion">cycle of erosion</a>" method of classifying rivers based on their "age". Although Davis's system is still found in many books today, after the 1950s and 1960s it became increasingly criticized and rejected by geomorphologists. His scheme did not produce testable hypotheses and was therefore deemed non-scientific. Examples of Davis's river "ages" include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Youthful river</b>: A river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider. Examples are the <a href="/wiki/Brazos_River" title="Brazos River">Brazos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trinity_River_(California)" title="Trinity River (California)">Trinity</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ebro_River" title="Ebro River">Ebro</a> rivers.</li>
<li><b>Mature river</b>: A river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper. Examples are the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_River" title="Saint Lawrence River">Saint Lawrence</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Danube_River" title="Danube River">Danube</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio</a>, <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">Thames</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paran%C3%A1_River" title="Paraná River">Paraná</a> rivers.</li>
<li><b>Old river</b>: A river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains. Examples are the <a href="/wiki/Yellow_River" title="Yellow River">Yellow</a>, lower <a href="/wiki/Ganges" title="Ganges">Ganges</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tigris" title="Tigris">Tigris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Euphrates" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indus_River" title="Indus River">Indus</a> and lower <a href="/wiki/Nile" title="Nile">Nile</a> rivers.</li>
<li><b>Rejuvenated river</b>: A river with a gradient that is raised by <a href="/wiki/Tectonics" title="Tectonics">tectonic</a> uplift. Examples are the <a href="/wiki/Rio_Grande" title="Rio Grande">Rio Grande</a> and <a href="/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ways in which a river's characteristics vary between its upper and lower course are summarized by the <a href="/wiki/Bradshaw_model" title="Bradshaw model">Bradshaw model</a>. Power-law relationships between channel slope, depth, and width are given as a function of discharge by "<a href="/wiki/River_regime" title="River regime">river regime</a>".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biotic_classification">Biotic classification</span></h3>
<p>There are several systems of classification based on biotic conditions typically assigning classes from the most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oligotrophic" title="Oligotrophic">oligotrophic</a> or unpolluted through to the most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eutrophic" title="Eutrophic">eutrophic</a> or polluted. Other systems are based on a whole eco-system approach such as developed by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment. In Europe, the requirements of the <a href="/wiki/Water_Framework_Directive" title="Water Framework Directive">Water Framework Directive</a> has led to the development of a wide range of classification methods including classifications based on fishery status A system of river zonation used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Francophone" title="Francophone">francophone</a> communities divides rivers into three primary zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>crenon</i> is the uppermost zone at the source of the river. It is further divided into the eucrenon (spring or boil zone) and the hypocrenon (brook or headstream zone). These areas have low temperatures, reduced oxygen content and slow moving water.</li>
<li>The <i>rhithron</i> is the upstream portion of the river that follows the crenon. It has relatively cool temperatures, high oxygen levels, and fast, turbulent, swift flow.</li>
<li>The <i>potamon</i> is the remaining downstream stretch of river. It has warmer temperatures, lower oxygen levels, slow flow and sandier bottoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Strahler_Stream_Order" title="Strahler Stream Order">Strahler Stream Order</a> ranks rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries.

Approximately 80% of the rivers and streams in the world are of the first and second order.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>

<p>Rivers have been used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for <a href="/wiki/Navigation" title="Navigation">transport</a>, as a defensive measure, as a source of <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a> to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste.</p>
<p>Rivers have been used for navigation for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of navigation is found in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>, which existed in northwestern India around 3300 BC. Riverine navigation provides a cheap means of transport, and is still used extensively on most major rivers of the world like the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ganges_River" title="Ganges River">Ganges</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Nile" title="Nile">Nile</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/River_Indus" title="River Indus">Indus</a>. Since river boats are often not regulated, they contribute a large amount to global <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Greenhouse_gas_emissions" title="Greenhouse gas">emissions</a>, and to local cancer due to inhaling of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_particulate_matter" title="Atmospheric particulate matter">particulates</a> emitted by the transports.</p>
<p>In some heavily forested regions such as <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lumberjack" title="Lumberjack">lumberjacks</a> use the river to float felled trees downstream to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost by transporting the huge heavy logs by natural means.</p>
<p>Rivers have been a source of food since pre-history. They are often a rich source of fish and other edible aquatic life, and are a major source of fresh water, which can be used for drinking and <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>. Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers. Rivers help to determine the <a href="/wiki/Urban_design" title="Urban design">urban form</a> of cities and neighbourhoods and their corridors often present opportunities for <a href="/wiki/Urban_renewal" title="Urban renewal">urban renewal</a> through the development of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foreshoreway" title="Foreshoreway">foreshoreways</a> such as river walks. Rivers also provide an easy means of disposing of waste water and, in much of the less developed world, other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wastes" title="Wastes">wastes</a>.</p>

<p>Fast flowing rivers and waterfalls are widely used as sources of energy, via <a href="/wiki/Watermill" title="Watermill">watermills</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_plant" title="Hydroelectric plant">hydroelectric plants</a>. Evidence of watermills shows them in use for many hundreds of years, for instance in <a href="/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> at <a href="/wiki/Dounby_Click_Mill" title="Dounby Click Mill">Dounby Click Mill</a>. Prior to the invention of steam power, watermills for grinding <a href="/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereals</a> and for processing <a href="/wiki/Wool" title="Wool">wool</a> and other textiles were common across <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. In the 1890s the first machines to generate power from river water were established at places such as <a href="/wiki/Cragside" title="Cragside">Cragside</a> in <a href="/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> and in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the development of large scale power generation from water, especially in wet mountainous regions such as <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>.</p>
<p>The coarse sediments, <a href="/wiki/Gravel" title="Gravel">gravel</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sand" title="Sand">sand</a>, generated and moved by rivers are extensively used in construction. In parts of the world this can generate extensive new lake habitats as gravel pits re-fill with water. In other circumstances it can destabilise the river bed and the course of the river and cause severe damage to spawning fish populations which rely on stable gravel formations for egg laying.</p>
<p>In upland rivers, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rapid" title="Rapid">rapids</a> with <a href="/wiki/Whitewater" title="Whitewater">whitewater</a> or even <a href="/wiki/Waterfall" title="Waterfall">waterfalls</a> occur. Rapids are often used for recreation, such as <a href="/wiki/Whitewater_kayaking" title="Whitewater kayaking">whitewater kayaking</a>.</p>
<p>Rivers have been important in determining political boundaries and defending countries. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> was a long-standing border of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and today it forms most of the border between <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>.

<p>The organisms in the <a href="/wiki/Riparian_zone" title="Riparian zone">riparian zone</a> respond to changes in river channel location and patterns of flow. The ecosystem of rivers is generally described by the <a href="/wiki/River_continuum_concept" title="River continuum concept">river continuum concept</a>, which has some additions and refinements to allow for dams and waterfalls and temporary extensive flooding. The concept describes the river as a system in which the physical parameters, the availability of food particles and the composition of the ecosystem are continuously changing along its length. The food (energy) that remains from the upstream part is used downstream.</p>
<p>The general pattern is that the first order streams contain particulate matter (decaying leaves from the surrounding forests) which is processed there by shredders like <a href="/wiki/Plecoptera" title="Plecoptera">Plecoptera</a> larvae. The products of these shredders are used by collectors, such as <a href="/wiki/Hydropsychidae" title="Hydropsychidae">Hydropsychidae</a>, and further downstream algae that create the <a href="/wiki/Primary_production" title="Primary production">primary production</a> become the main food source of the organisms.

<p>The chemistry of rivers is complex and depends on inputs from the atmosphere, the geology through which it travels and the inputs from man's activities. The chemical composition of the water has a large impact on the ecology of that water for both plants and animals and it also affects the uses that may be made of the river water. Understanding and characterising river water chemistry requires a well designed and managed sampling and analysis.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flooding">Flooding</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Flood" title="Flood">Flood</a></div>

<p>Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycle. The majority of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during the <a href="/wiki/Flood_stage" title="Flood stage">flood stage</a>. In many developed areas, human activity has changed the form of river channels, altering magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of <a href="/wiki/Levee" title="Levee">levees</a>, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural <a href="/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetlands</a>. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream, increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage, which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees only protects the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the river flow is impeded by the narrow channel banks.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flow">Flow</span></h2>
<p>Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of <a href="/wiki/Hydrology" title="Hydrology">hydrology</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Direction">Direction</span></h3>

<p>Rivers flow downhill with their power derived from gravity. The direction can involve all directions of the compass and can be a complex meandering path.</p>
<p>Rivers flowing downhill, from river source to river mouth, do not necessarily take the shortest path. For alluvial streams, straight and braided rivers have very low sinuosity and flow directly down hill, while meandering rivers flow from side to side across a valley. Bedrock rivers typically flow in either a <a href="/wiki/Fractal" title="Fractal">fractal</a> pattern, or a pattern that is determined by weaknesses in the bedrock, such as <a href="/wiki/Fault_(geology)" title="Fault (geology)">faults</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fracture_(geology)" title="Fracture (geology)">fractures</a>, or more erodible layers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rate">Rate</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate" title="Volumetric flow rate">Volumetric flow rate</a>, also known as discharge, volume flow rate, and rate of water flow, is the volume of water which passes through a given cross-section of the river channel per unit time. It is typically measured in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cubic_metres_per_second" title="Cubic metres per second">cubic metres per second</a> (cumec) or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cubic_feet_per_second" title="Cubic feet per second">cubic feet per second</a> (cfs), where 1 m/s = 35.51 ft/s; it is sometimes also measured in <a href="/wiki/Litre" title="Litre">litres</a> or <a href="/wiki/Gallon" title="Gallon">gallons</a> per second.</p>
<p>Volumetric flow rate can be thought of as the mean velocity of the flow through a given cross-section, times that cross-sectional area. Mean velocity can be approximated through the use of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_the_Wall" title="Law of the Wall">Law of the Wall</a>. In general, velocity increases with the depth (or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydraulic_radius" title="Hydraulic radius">hydraulic radius</a>) and slope of the river channel, while the cross-sectional area scales with the depth and the width: the double-counting of depth shows the importance of this variable in determining the discharge through the channel.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sediment_yield">Sediment yield</span></h2>
<p>Sediment yield is the total quantity of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures the fact that not all of the sediment is eroded within a certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio.</p>

<li>River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>River management is a continuous activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by people. Dredged channels silt up, <a href="/wiki/Sluice" title="Sluice">sluice mechanisms</a> deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. The benefits sought through managing rivers may often be offset by the social and economic costs of mitigating the bad effects of such management. As an example, in parts of the developed world, rivers have been confined within channels to free up flat flood-plain land for development. Floods can inundate such development at high financial cost and often with loss of life.</p>
