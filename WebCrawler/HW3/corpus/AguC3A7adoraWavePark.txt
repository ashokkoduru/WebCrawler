<p>The <b>Aguçadoura Wave Farm</b> was the world's first <a href="/wiki/Wave_farm" title="Wave farm">wave farm</a>. It was located 5 km (3 mi) offshore near <a href="/wiki/P%C3%B3voa_de_Varzim" title="Póvoa de Varzim">Póvoa de Varzim</a> north of <a href="/wiki/Porto" title="Porto">Porto</a> in <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. The farm was designed to use three <a href="/wiki/Pelamis_Wave_Energy_Converter" title="Pelamis Wave Energy Converter">Pelamis Wave Energy Converters</a> to convert the motion of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ocean_surface_wave" title="Ocean surface wave">ocean surface waves</a> into electricity, totalling to 2.25 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a> in total installed capacity. The farm was officially opened on 23 September 2008, by the Portuguese Minister of Economy. The wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in November 2008.</p>

<p>Developed by the Scottish company <a href="/wiki/Pelamis_Wave_Power" title="Pelamis Wave Power">Pelamis Wave Power</a>, the Pelamis machine is made up of connected sections which flex and bend relative to one another as waves run along the structure. This motion is resisted by <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_ram" title="Hydraulic ram">hydraulic rams</a> which pump high pressure oil through <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_machinery" title="Hydraulic machinery">hydraulic motors</a> which in turn drive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_generator" title="Electrical generator">electrical generators</a>. The three machines which made up the Aguçadoura Wave Park were each rated at a peak output of 750 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatt" title="Kilowatt">kW</a>, giving an installed peak capacity of 2.25 MW, enough to meet the average electricity demand of more than 1,500 Portuguese homes. The average output from a Pelamis machine will depend on the wave resource in a particular area. The higher the resource the higher the average output. According to information on the Pelamis web site, it appears that the average power output for a Pelamis wave machine is about 150 kW. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Project_management">Project management</span></h2>
<p>The project was originally conceived by the Portuguese renewable energy company <a href="/wiki/Enersis" title="Enersis">Enersis</a>, which developed and financed the project and which was subsequently bought by the Australian infrastructure company <a href="/wiki/Babcock_%26_Brown" title="Babcock &amp; Brown">Babcock &amp; Brown</a> in December 2005. In the last quarter of 2008, Babcock &amp; Brown had its shares suspended and has been in a managed process of selling its assets, including the Aguçadoura project. In March 2009, Babcock &amp; Brown went into voluntary administration.</p>
<p>In November 2008, the Pelamis machines were brought back to harbor at <a href="/wiki/Leix%C3%B5es" title="Leixões">Leixões</a> due to a technical problem with some of the bearings for which a solution has been found. However, the machines are likely to remain off-line until a new partner is found to take over Babcock &amp; Brown’s 77% share in the project. This seems unlikely, because according to Pelamis "those machines are sub-optimal" and the owner is trying to sell them. Pelamis is now focusing its efforts on the new P2 machine, which has been tested in Orkney in Scotland since 2010.</p>
