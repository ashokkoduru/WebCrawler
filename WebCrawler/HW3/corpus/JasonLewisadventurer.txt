<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Expedition_360">Expedition 360</span></h2>
<p>Lewis set off with friend and fellow adventurer Stevie Smith from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenwich,_London" title="Greenwich, London">Greenwich, London</a> on 12 July 1994, to complete the world's first human-powered circumnavigation, and the two dubbed the journey <a href="/wiki/Expedition_360" title="Expedition 360">Expedition 360</a>. By July 2007, Lewis had travelled over 60,000 km (37,000 mi). He successfully ended his 4,833-day expedition on 6 October 2007, having travelled 74,842 km (46,505 mi).</p>
<p>In mid-1994, Lewis and Smith mountain-biked 1,700 miles through France, Spain and <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> to the port of <a href="/wiki/Lagos,_Portugal" title="Lagos, Portugal">Lagos, Portugal</a>. Departing on 13 October 1994, Lewis and Smith then pedaled 111 consecutive days and 4,500 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami,_Florida" title="Miami, Florida">Miami, Florida</a> in a wooden pedal-powered boat named <i>Moksha</i>.</p>
<p>Lewis then roller bladed thousands of miles across North America. He was struck by a drunk driver in <a href="/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado" title="Pueblo, Colorado">Pueblo, Colorado</a>, and spent nine months recovering from two broken legs. He finished the North American expedition leg in 1996.</p>
<p>In 1998 and 1999, Lewis and Smith spent 53 days pedaling <i>Moksha</i> across the Pacific Ocean from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Francisco,_California" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a> to <a href="/wiki/Hilo,_Hawaii" title="Hilo, Hawaii">Hilo, Hawaii</a>, where Smith ended his journey. In four days, Lewis and a small group of supporters hiked the 80 miles across Hawaii.</p>
<p>After 73 days of solo pedaling <i>Moksha</i> across the <a href="/wiki/Doldrums" title="Doldrums">doldrums</a>, Lewis completed the Pacific Ocean crossing from Hawaii to the island <a href="/wiki/Atoll" title="Atoll">atoll</a> of <a href="/wiki/Tarawa" title="Tarawa">Tarawa</a>. In May 2000, he was accompanied by <i>Moksha's</i> builder, Chris Tipper, to pedal the 1,300-mile stretch from <a href="/wiki/Tarawa" title="Tarawa">Tarawa</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. With the help of friend and expedition supporter April Abril, Lewis then pedaled <i>Moksha</i> 1,450 miles for 32 days across the <a href="/wiki/Coral_Sea" title="Coral Sea">Coral Sea</a> to Australia.</p>
<p>In 2001, Lewis and a group of supporters spent 88 days cycling 3,500 miles across the Australian outback, starting near <a href="/wiki/Cooktown,_Queensland" title="Cooktown, Queensland">Cooktown, Queensland</a>, and finishing in the port city of <a href="/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">Darwin, Northern Territory</a>.</p>
<p>After spending many years raising funds to continue <a href="/wiki/Expedition_360" title="Expedition 360">Expedition 360</a>, Lewis was reunited with <i>Moksha</i> in 2005. He and expedition supporter Lourdes Arango pedaled 450 nautical miles from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Darwin,_Australia" title="Darwin, Australia">Darwin, Australia</a> to <a href="/wiki/Dili" title="Dili">Dili</a>, East Timor.</p>
<p>Throughout 2005, Lewis <a href="/wiki/Kayak" title="Kayak">kayaked</a> thousands of miles through the Indonesian archipelago from <a href="/wiki/East_Timor" title="East Timor">East Timor</a> to Singapore. In 2006, he biked from Singapore to the <a href="/wiki/Himalayas" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, and biked and hiked through the <a href="/wiki/Himalayas" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> to the port of <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.</p>
<p>Covering 2,000 nautical miles in 46 days during early 2007, Lewis and friend Sher Dhillon pedaled <i>Moksha</i> from <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, crossing the <a href="/wiki/Arabian_Sea" title="Arabian Sea">Arabian Sea</a> to <a href="/wiki/Djibouti" title="Djibouti">Djibouti</a>.</p>
<p>Lewis then planned to travel through <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and the Middle East before reaching Europe – encountering a problem in Sudan. The Egyptian authorities would not let him pass through their waters, and when his visa for Sudan ran out he was left with an "impossible decision". He attempted to kayak across <a href="/wiki/Lake_Nasser" title="Lake Nasser">Lake Nasser</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abu_Simbel" title="Abu Simbel">Abu Simbel</a> but was arrested on suspicion of spying. He was released, but the Egyptian authorities forbade him from mountain-biking the 178-mile journey to <a href="/wiki/Aswan" title="Aswan">Aswan</a>. He completed this section illegally by riding partly at night. During his journey through Sudan he encountered actors <a href="/wiki/Ewan_McGregor" title="Ewan McGregor">Ewan McGregor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charley_Boorman" title="Charley Boorman">Charley Boorman</a> who were travelling south as part of their <a href="/wiki/Long_Way_Down" title="Long Way Down">Long Way Down</a> motorbike trip.</p>

<p>In July 2007, Lewis reached <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and then cycled across <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, Germany, and <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> before returning to London on 6 October. Pulling <i>Moksha</i> in tow, Lewis crossed the Greenwich Meridian Line where he had begun his expedition 13 years earlier.</p>
<p>During his expedition, Lewis twice survived malaria, septicaemia, a bout of mild schizophrenia, and a crocodile attack near Australia in 2005.</p>
<p>As part of a wider interest in sustainability and education, Lewis has visited more than 900 schools in 37 countries, giving talks to students and involving them in a variety of programs to promote world citizenship, zero carbon emission travel, and awareness of consumption habits on the health of the planet.</p>
