<p><b>Pollution</b> is the introduction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contaminant" title="Contaminant">contaminants</a> into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of <a href="/wiki/Chemical_substance" title="Chemical substance">chemical substances</a> or <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a>, such as noise, heat or light. <a href="/wiki/Pollutant" title="Pollutant">Pollutants</a>, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as <a href="/wiki/Point_source_pollution" title="Point source pollution">point source</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nonpoint_source_pollution" title="Nonpoint source pollution">nonpoint source pollution</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_cultures">Ancient cultures</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">Air pollution</a> has always accompanied civilizations. Pollution started from prehistoric times when man created the first fires. According to a 1983 article in the journal <i>Science,</i> "<a href="/wiki/Soot" title="Soot">soot</a> found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires." Metal <a href="/wiki/Forging" title="Forging">forging</a> appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. Core samples of glaciers in Greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with Greek, Roman and Chinese metal production, but at that time the pollution was comparatively small and could be handled by nature.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Urban_pollution">Urban pollution</span></h2>

<p>The burning of coal and wood, and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the cesspools of pollution. The Industrial Revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and <a href="/wiki/Waste" title="Waste">wastes</a> into local streams that served as the water supply. <a href="/wiki/Edward_I_of_England" title="Edward I of England">King Edward I</a> of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> in 1272, after its smoke became a problem. But the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>It was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. London also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the <a href="/wiki/Great_Stink" title="Great Stink">Great Stink</a> on the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">Thames</a> of 1858, which led to construction of the <a href="/wiki/London_sewerage_system" title="London sewerage system">London sewerage system</a> soon afterward. Pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded view ability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. Reformers began to demand sewer systems, and clean water.</p>
<p>In 1870, the sanitary conditions in Berlin were among the worst in Europe. <a href="/wiki/August_Bebel" title="August Bebel">August Bebel</a> recalled conditions before a modern <a href="/wiki/Sewerage" title="Sewerage">sewer</a> system was built in the late 1870s:</p>

<p>The primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital, and the Imperial German government brought in its scientists, engineers and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies but to forge Berlin as the world's model city. A British expert in 1906 concluded that Berlin represented "the most complete application of science, order and method of public life," adding "it is a marvel of civic administration, the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is."</p>
<p>The emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal gave rise to unprecedented <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. Chicago and Cincinnati were the first two American cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881. Pollution became a major issue in the United States in the early twentieth century, as <a href="/wiki/Progressive_Era" title="Progressive Era">progressive reformers</a> took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning, water pollution caused by bad sanitation, and street pollution caused by the 3 million horses who worked in American cities in 1900, generating large quantities of urine and manure. As historian Martin Melosi notes, The generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as "miracles of cleanliness.". By the 1940s, however, automobile-caused smog was a major issue in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century, when the short lived Office of Air Pollution was created under the Department of the Interior. Extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donora,_Pennsylvania" title="Donora, Pennsylvania">Donora, Pennsylvania</a> in the late 1940s, serving as another public reminder. Air pollution would continue to be a problem in England, especially later during the industrial revolution, and extending into the recent past with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Smog_of_1952" title="Great Smog of 1952">Great Smog of 1952</a>.</p>
<p>Awareness of atmospheric pollution spread widely after World War II, with fears triggered by reports of radioactive fallout from atomic warfare and testing. Then a non-nuclear event, The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Smog" title="Great Smog">Great Smog</a> of 1952 in London, killed at least 4000 people. This prompted some of the first major modern environmental legislation, The <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956" title="Clean Air Act 1956">Clean Air Act of 1956</a>.</p>
<p>Pollution began to draw major public attention in the United States between the mid-1950s and early 1970s, when Congress passed the <a href="/wiki/Noise_Control_Act" title="Noise Control Act">Noise Control Act</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)" title="Clean Air Act (United States)">Clean Air Act</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Water_Act" title="Clean Water Act">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act" title="National Environmental Policy Act">National Environmental Policy Act</a>.</p>

<p>Severe incidents of pollution helped increase consciousness. <a href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl" title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</a> dumping in the <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" title="Hudson River">Hudson River</a> resulted in a ban by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</a> on consumption of its fish in 1974. Long-term <a href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins" title="Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins">dioxin</a> contamination at <a href="/wiki/Love_Canal" title="Love Canal">Love Canal</a> starting in 1947 became a national news story in 1978 and led to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superfund_(environmental_law)" title="Superfund (environmental law)">Superfund</a> legislation of 1980. The pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brownfield" title="Brownfield">brownfield</a>, a term now common in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/City_planning" title="City planning">city planning</a>.</p>
<p>The development of nuclear science introduced <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_contamination" title="Radioactive contamination">radioactive contamination</a>, which can remain lethally radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. <a href="/wiki/Lake_Karachay" title="Lake Karachay">Lake Karachay</a>, named by the <a href="/wiki/Worldwatch_Institute" title="Worldwatch Institute">Worldwatch Institute</a> as the "most polluted spot" on earth, served as a disposal site for the Soviet Union throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Second place may go to the area of Chelyabinsk Russian as the "Most polluted place on the planet".</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" title="Nuclear weapons">Nuclear weapons</a> continued to be tested in the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactivity" title="Radioactivity">radioactivity</a> has also been a prohibitive complication associated with <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>. Though extreme care is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island" title="Three Mile Island">Three Mile Island</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl" title="Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. Widespread support for <a href="/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty" title="Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty">test ban treaties</a> has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>International catastrophes such as the wreck of the <a href="/wiki/Amoco_Cadiz" title="Amoco Cadiz">Amoco Cadiz</a> oil tanker off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Brittany" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> in 1978 and the <a href="/wiki/Bhopal_disaster" title="Bhopal disaster">Bhopal disaster</a> in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term <a href="/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant" title="Persistent organic pollutant">persistent organic pollutant</a> (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PBDE" title="PBDE">PBDEs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fluorocarbon" title="Fluorocarbon">PFCs</a> among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.</p>
<p>A much more recently discovered problem is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch" title="Great Pacific Garbage Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>, a huge concentration of plastics, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical_sludge" title="Chemical sludge">chemical sludge</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Debris" title="Debris">debris</a> which has been collected into a large area of the Pacific Ocean by the <a href="/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre" title="North Pacific Gyre">North Pacific Gyre</a>. This is a less well known pollution problem than the others described above, but nonetheless has multiple and serious consequences such as increasing wildlife mortality, the spread of invasive species and human ingestion of toxic chemicals. Organizations such as <a href="/wiki/5_Gyres" title="5 Gyres">5 Gyres</a> have researched the pollution and, along with artists like <a href="/wiki/Marina_DeBris" title="Marina DeBris">Marina DeBris</a>, are working toward publicizing the issue.</p>
<p>Pollution introduced by light at night is becoming a global problem, more severe in urban centres, but nonetheless contaminating also large territories, far away from towns.</p>
<p>Growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a>, which generally seek to limit <a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">human impact on the environment</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pollutant" title="Pollutant">Pollutant</a></div>
<p>A pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air, water or soil. Three factors determine the severity of a pollutant: its chemical nature, the concentration and the persistence.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost_of_pollution">Cost of pollution</span></h2>
<p>Pollution has cost. Manufacturing activities that cause <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of <a href="/wiki/Externalization" title="Externalization">externalization</a> is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_safety" title="Public safety">public safety</a>, less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sources_and_causes">Sources and causes</span></h2>

<p>Air pollution comes from both natural and human-made (anthropogenic) sources. However, globally human-made pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Motor_vehicle_emissions" title="Motor vehicle emissions">Motor vehicle emissions</a> are one of the leading causes of air pollution. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollution_in_China" title="Air pollution in China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution_in_the_United_States" title="Air pollution in the United States">United States</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Russia" title="Air pollution in Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution_in_India" title="Air pollution in India">India</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Mexico" title="Air pollution in Mexico">Mexico</a>, and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Air_pollution_in_Japan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Air pollution in Japan (page does not exist)">Japan</a> are the world leaders in air pollution emissions. Principal stationary pollution sources include <a href="/wiki/Chemical_plant" title="Chemical plant">chemical plants</a>, coal-fired <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_plants" title="Power plants">power plants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> plants, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_waste" title="Nuclear waste">nuclear waste</a> disposal activity, incinerators, large livestock farms (dairy cows, pigs, poultry, etc.), <a href="/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">PVC</a> factories, metals production factories, plastics factories, and other <a href="/wiki/Heavy_industry" title="Heavy industry">heavy industry</a>. Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides</p>
<p>About 400 million metric tons of <a href="/wiki/Hazardous_waste" title="Hazardous waste">hazardous wastes</a> are generated each year. The United States alone produces about 250 million metric tons. Americans constitute less than 5% of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World%27s_population" title="World's population">world's population</a>, but produce roughly 25% of the world’s <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a>, and generate approximately 30% of <a href="/wiki/Waste" title="Waste">world’s waste</a>. In 2007, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">China</a> has overtaken the United States as the world's biggest producer of CO<sub>2</sub>, while still far behind based on per capita pollution - ranked 78th among the world's nations.</p>

<p>In February 2007, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing the work of 2,500 scientists, economists, and policymakers from more than 120 countries, said that humans have been the primary cause of global warming since 1950. Humans have ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the consequences of global warming, a major climate report concluded. But to change the climate, the transition from fossil fuels like coal and oil needs to occur within decades, according to the final report this year from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>
<p>Some of the more common <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> contaminants are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chlorinated_hydrocarbon" title="Chlorinated hydrocarbon">chlorinated hydrocarbons</a> (CFH), <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metals" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a>–found in rechargeable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nickel-cadmium_battery" title="Nickel-cadmium battery">batteries</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>–found in lead <a href="/wiki/Paint" title="Paint">paint</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aviation_fuel" title="Aviation fuel">aviation fuel</a> and still in some countries, <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MTBE" title="MTBE">MTBE</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benzene" title="Benzene">benzene</a>. In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called <i><a href="/wiki/Fateful_Harvest" title="Fateful Harvest">Fateful Harvest</a></i> unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal <a href="/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a> are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of <a href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins" title="Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins">polychlorinated dibenzodioxins</a>, commonly called <i>dioxins</i> for simplicity, such as <a href="/wiki/2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin" title="2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin">TCDD</a>.</p>
<p>Pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. For example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hurricane" title="Hurricane">hurricanes</a> often involve water contamination from sewage, and <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> spills from ruptured <a href="/wiki/Boat" title="Boat">boats</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobiles</a>. Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_rigs" title="Oil rigs">oil rigs</a> or <a href="/wiki/Refinery" title="Refinery">refineries</a> are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> plants or <a href="/wiki/Oil_tanker" title="Oil tanker">oil tankers</a>, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="/wiki/Noise_pollution" title="Noise pollution">noise pollution</a> the dominant source class is the <a href="/wiki/Motor_vehicle" title="Motor vehicle">motor vehicle</a>, producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Perspectives">Perspectives</span></h2>
<p>The earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence. The attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>. These would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately, species extinction. Processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations. At the extremes, for any form of life, consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival.</p>
<p>For humankind, the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration, both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts. Short of survival, human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards. Since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive, modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable. Common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile_emissions_control" title="Automobile emissions control">automobile emissions control</a>, industrial exposure (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) <a href="/wiki/Permissible_exposure_limit" title="Permissible exposure limit">PELs</a>), <a href="/wiki/Toxicology" title="Toxicology">toxicology</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Median_lethal_dose" title="Median lethal dose">LD<font size="-1"><sub>50</sub></font></a>), and <a href="/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medication" title="Medication">medication</a> and <a href="/wiki/Absorbed_dose" title="Absorbed dose">radiation</a> doses).</p>
<p>"The solution to pollution is dilution", is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful. It is well-suited to some other modern, locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hazardous_material" title="Hazardous material">hazardous material</a> release emergency management. But it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases.</p>
<p>Such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative, human population and densities were lower, technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign. But these are often no longer the case. Furthermore, advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before. The use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency to the principle of probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or infeasible. In addition, consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence.</p>
<p>Yet in the absence of a superseding principle, this older approach predominates practices throughout the world. It is the basis by which to gauge concentrations of effluent for legal release, exceeding which penalties are assessed or restrictions applied. One such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries, as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non-hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process. Migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be confronted by challenging economical and technological barriers.</p>
