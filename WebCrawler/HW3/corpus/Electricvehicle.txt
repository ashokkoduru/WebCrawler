<p>EVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. The internal combustion engine (ICE) has been the dominant propulsion method for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automobile" title="Automobile">motor vehicles</a> for almost 100 years, but electric power has remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types.</p>

<p>Electric motive power started in 1827, when Slovak-Hungarian priest <a href="/wiki/%C3%81nyos_Jedlik" title="Ányos Jedlik">Ányos Jedlik</a> built the first crude but viable electric motor, provided with stator, rotor and commutator, and the year after he used it to power a tiny car. A few years later, in 1835, professor <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Sibrandus_Stratingh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sibrandus Stratingh (page does not exist)">Sibrandus Stratingh</a> of University of Groningen, the Netherlands, built a small scale electric car and a Robert Anderson of Scotland is reported to have made a crude electric carriage sometime between the years of 1832 and 1839. Around the same period, early experimental electrical cars were moving on rails, too. American blacksmith and inventor <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Davenport_(inventor)" title="Thomas Davenport (inventor)">Thomas Davenport</a> built a toy electric locomotive, powered by a primitive electric motor, in 1835. In 1838, a Scotsman named <a href="/wiki/Robert_Davidson_(inventor)" title="Robert Davidson (inventor)">Robert Davidson</a> built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour (6 km/h). In England a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Lilley_and_Colten&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Lilley and Colten (page does not exist)">Lilley and Colten</a> in 1847.</p>
<p>Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain), <a href="/wiki/Robert_Anderson_(inventor)" title="Robert Anderson (inventor)">Robert Anderson</a> of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> invented the first crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable <a href="/wiki/Primary_cell" title="Primary cell">primary cells</a>.</p>
<p>By the 20th century, <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric cars</a> and rail transport were commonplace, with commercial electric automobiles having the majority of the market. Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles, as <a href="/wiki/Electric_platform_truck" title="Electric platform truck">platform trucks</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forklift_truck" title="Forklift truck">forklift trucks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ambulance" title="Ambulance">ambulances</a>, tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British <a href="/wiki/Milk_float" title="Milk float">milk float</a>; for most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's largest user of electric road vehicles.</p>
<p>Electrified trains were used for <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> transport, as the motors did not use precious <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> in the mines. Switzerland's lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Switzerland" title="Rail transport in Switzerland">their rail network</a>. One of the earliest <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rechargeable_batteries" title="Rechargeable batteries">rechargeable batteries</a> - the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nickel-iron_battery" title="Nickel-iron battery">nickel-iron battery</a> - was favored by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Edison</a> for use in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_cars" title="Electric cars">electric cars</a>.</p>
<p>EVs were among the earliest automobiles, and before the preeminence of light, powerful <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engines" title="Internal combustion engines">internal combustion engines</a>, electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s. They were produced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baker_Electric" title="Baker Electric">Baker Electric</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Columbia_Automobile_Company" title="Columbia Automobile Company">Columbia Electric</a>, <a href="/wiki/Detroit_Electric" title="Detroit Electric">Detroit Electric</a>, and others, and at one point in history out-sold gasoline-powered vehicles. In fact, in 1900, 28 percent of the cars on the road in the USA were electric. EVs were so popular that even President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> and his secret service agents toured Washington DC in their Milburn Electrics, which covered 60–70 mi (100–110 km) per charge.</p>
<p>A number of developments contributed to decline of electric cars. <a href="/wiki/Auto_trail" title="Auto trail">Improved road infrastructure</a> required a greater range than that offered by electric cars, and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in Texas, Oklahoma, and California led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline/petrol, making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Also internal combustion powered cars became ever easier to operate thanks to the invention of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_starter" title="Electric starter">electric starter</a> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charles_Kettering" title="Charles Kettering">Charles Kettering</a> in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the <a href="/wiki/Muffler" title="Muffler">muffler</a>, which <a href="/wiki/Hiram_Percy_Maxim" title="Hiram Percy Maxim">Hiram Percy Maxim</a> had invented in 1897. As roads were improved outside urban areas electric vehicle range could not compete with the ICE. Finally, <a href="/wiki/Assembly_line" title="Assembly line">the initiation of mass production</a> of gasoline-powered vehicles by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ford" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a> in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, <a href="/wiki/National_City_Lines" title="National City Lines">National City Lines</a>, which was a partnership of <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" title="General Motors">General Motors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company" title="Firestone Tire and Rubber Company">Firestone</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Standard_Oil_of_California" title="Standard Oil of California">Standard Oil of California</a> purchased many electric <a href="/wiki/Tram" title="Tram">tram</a> networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with GM buses. The partnership was convicted of <a href="/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy" title="General Motors streetcar conspiracy">conspiring</a> to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies, but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Experimentation">Experimentation</span></h3>
<p>In January 1990, General Motors' President introduced its EV concept two-seater, the "Impact", at the Los Angeles Auto Show. That September, the California Air Resources Board mandated major-automaker sales of EVs, in phases starting in 1998. From 1996 to 1998 GM produced 1117 EV1s, 800 of which were made available through three-year leases.</p>
<p>Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan and Toyota also produced limited numbers of EVs for California drivers. In 2003, upon the expiration of GM's <a href="/wiki/General_Motors_EV1" title="General Motors EV1">EV1</a> leases, GM crushed them. The crushing has variously been attributed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the auto industry's successful <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_federal_courts" title="United States federal courts">federal court</a> challenge to California's <a href="/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle" title="Zero-emissions vehicle">zero-emissions vehicle</a> mandate,</li>
<li>a federal regulation requiring GM to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousands EV1s and</li>
<li>the success of the oil and auto industries' media campaign to reduce public acceptance of EVs.</li>
</ul>

<p>A movie made on the subject in 2005-2006 was titled <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" title="Who Killed the Electric Car?">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a></i> and released theatrically by <a href="/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Classics" title="Sony Pictures Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a> in 2006.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford" title="Ford">Ford</a> released a number of their <a href="/wiki/Ford_Ecostar" title="Ford Ecostar">Ford Ecostar</a> delivery vans into the market. Honda, Nissan and Toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their EVs, which, like the GM EV1s, had been available only by closed-end lease. After public protests, Toyota sold 200 of its <a href="/wiki/Toyota_RAV4_EV" title="Toyota RAV4 EV">RAV EVs</a> to eager buyers; they later sold at over their original forty-thousand-dollar price. This lesson did not go unlearned; <a href="/wiki/BMW" title="BMW">BMW</a> of Canada sold off a number of Mini EV's when their Canadian testing ended.</p>

<p>Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires. Electric traction allows the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regenerative_braking" title="Regenerative braking">regenerative braking</a>, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of, usually, a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines.

This regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to utilise the power generated by descending vehicles.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_sources">Energy sources</span></h3>
<p>Although EVs have few direct emissions, all rely on energy created through <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>, and will usually emit pollution and generate waste, unless it is generated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_source" title="Renewable source">renewable source</a> power plants. Since EVs use whatever electricity is delivered by their electrical utility/grid operator, EVs can be made more or less efficient, polluting and expensive to run, by modifying the electrical generating stations. This would be done by an electrical utility under a government energy policy, in a timescale negotiated between utilities and government.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">Fossil fuel</a> vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a nation's fleet of vehicles. New efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles, often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their end-of-life. Only a few nations set a retirement age for old vehicles, such as Japan or <a href="/wiki/Driving_in_Singapore" title="Driving in Singapore">Singapore</a>, forcing periodic upgrading of all vehicles already on the road.</p>
<p>EVs will take advantage of whatever environmental gains happen when a renewable energy generation station comes online, a <a href="/wiki/Fossil-fuel_power_station" title="Fossil-fuel power station">fossil-fuel power station</a> is decommissioned or upgraded. Conversely, if government policy or economic conditions shifts generators back to use more polluting fossil fuels and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine_vehicle" title="Internal combustion engine vehicle">internal combustion engine vehicles</a> (ICEVs), or more inefficient sources, the reverse can happen. Even in such a situation, electrical vehicles are still more efficient than a comparable amount of fossil fuel vehicles. In areas with a deregulated electrical energy market, an electrical vehicle owner can choose whether to run his electrical vehicle off conventional electrical energy sources, or strictly from renewable electrical energy sources (presumably at an additional cost), pushing other consumers onto conventional sources, and switch at any time between the two.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Efficiency">Efficiency</span></h3>
<p>Because of the different methods of charging possible, the emissions produced have been quantified in different ways. Plug-in all-electric and hybrid vehicles also have different consumption characteristics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electromagnetic_radiation">Electromagnetic radiation</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">Electromagnetic radiation</a> from high performance electrical motors has been claimed to be associated with some human ailments, but such claims are largely unsubstantiated except for extremely high exposures. Electric motors can be shielded within a metallic <a href="/wiki/Faraday_cage" title="Faraday cage">Faraday cage</a>, but this reduces efficiency by adding weight to the vehicle, while it is not conclusive that all electromagnetic radiation can be contained.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Charging">Charging</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Grid_capacity">Grid capacity</span></h4>
<p>If a large proportion of private vehicles were to convert to grid electricity it would increase the demand for generation and transmission, and consequent emissions. However, overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish because of the higher efficiency of EVs over the entire cycle. In the USA it has been estimated there is already nearly sufficient existing power plant and transmission infrastructure, assuming that most charging would occur overnight, using the most efficient off-peak <a href="/wiki/Base_load" title="Base load">base load</a> sources.</p>
<p>In the UK however, things are different. While National Grid’s high-voltage electricity transmission system can currently manage the demand of 1 million electric cars, Steve Holliday (CEO National Grid PLC) said, “penetration up and above that becomes a real issue. Local distribution networks in cities like London may struggle to balance their grids if drivers choose to all plug in their cars at the same time."</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Charging_stations">Charging stations</span></h4>



<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Charging_station" title="Charging station">Charging station</a></div>
<p>EVs typically charge from conventional power outlets or dedicated charging stations, a process that typically takes hours, but can be done overnight and often gives a charge that is sufficient for normal everyday usage.</p>
<p>However, with the widespread implementation of <a href="/wiki/Electric_vehicle_network" title="Electric vehicle network">electric vehicle networks</a> within large cities, such as those provided by POD Point <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pod-point.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> in the UK and Europe, EV users can plug in their cars whilst at work and leave them to charge throughout the day, extending the possible range of commutes and eliminating <a href="/wiki/Range_anxiety" title="Range anxiety">range anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>A recharging system that avoids the need for a cable is Curb Connect, patented in 2012 by Dr Gordon Dower. In this system, electrical contacts are fitted into curbs, such as angle parking spaces on city streets. When a suitably authorized vehicle is parked so that its front end overhangs the curb, the curb contacts become energized and charging occurs.</p>
<p>Another proposed solution for daily recharging is a standardized <a href="/wiki/Inductive_charging" title="Inductive charging">inductive charging</a> system such as Evatran's <a href="/wiki/Plugless_Power" title="Plugless Power">Plugless Power</a>. Benefits are the convenience of parking over the charge station and minimized cabling and connection infrastructure. <a href="/wiki/Qualcomm" title="Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> is trialling such a system in London in early 2012.</p>
<p>Yet another proposed solution for the typically less frequent, long distance travel is "rapid charging", such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aerovironment" title="Aerovironment">Aerovironment</a> PosiCharge line (up to 250 kW) and the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Norvik&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Norvik (page does not exist)">Norvik</a> MinitCharge line (up to 300 kW). <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Ecotality&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ecotality (page does not exist)">Ecotality</a> is a manufacturer of Charging Stations and has partnered with Nissan on several installations. Battery replacement is also proposed as an alternative, although no OEMs including Nissan/Renault have any production vehicle plans. Swapping requires standardization across platforms, models and manufacturers. Swapping also requires many times more battery packs to be in the system.</p>
<p>One type of battery "replacement" proposed, <a href="/wiki/Vanadium_redox_battery" title="Vanadium redox battery">vanadium redox battery</a>, is much simpler: while the latest generation of <a href="/wiki/Vanadium_redox_battery" title="Vanadium redox battery">vanadium redox battery</a> only has an energy density similar to lead-acid, the charge is stored solely in a vanadium-based electrolyte, which can be pumped out and replaced with charged fluid. The vanadium battery system is also a potential candidate for intermediate energy storage in quick charging stations because of its high power density and extremely good endurance in daily use. System cost however, is still prohibitive. As vanadium battery systems are estimated to range between $350–$600 per kWh, a battery that can service one hundred customers in a 24-hour period at 50 kWh per charge would cost $1.8-$3 million.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">Department of Energy</a> research conducted at <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_National_Laboratory" title="Pacific Northwest National Laboratory">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>, 84% of existing vehicles could be switched over to <a href="/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid" title="Plug-in hybrid">plug-in hybrids</a> without requiring any new grid infrastructure.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Battery_swapping">Battery swapping</span></h4>
<p>Instead of recharging EVs from electric socket, batteries could be mechanically replaced on special stations in a couple of minutes (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Battery_swapping" title="Battery swapping">battery swapping</a>).</p>
<p>Batteries with greatest <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a> such as metal-air fuel cells usually cannot be recharged in purely electric way. Instead, some kind of metallurgical process is needed, such as aluminum smelting and similar.</p>
<p>Silicon-air, aluminum-air and other metal-air fuel cells look promising candidates for swap batteries. Any source of energy, renewable or non-renewable, could be used to remake used metal-air fuel cells with relatively high efficiency. Investment in infrastructure will be needed. The cost of such batteries could be an issue, although they could be made with replaceable anodes and electrolyte.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chassis_swapping">Chassis swapping</span></h4>

<p>Dr Dower has proposed that an individual might own only the body (or perhaps a few different style bodies) for their vehicle, and would lease the chassis from a pool, thereby reducing the depreciation costs associated with vehicle ownership.</p>

<p>There is a growing concern about the safety of EVs, given the demonstrated tendency of the Lithium-ion battery, most promising for EV use because of its high energy density, to overheat, possibly leading to fire or explosion, especially when damaged in a crash. The U.S. <a href="/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> opened a defect investigation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chevy_Volt" title="Chevy Volt">Chevy Volt</a> on November 25, 2011 amid concerns over the risk of battery fires in a crash. At that time, automotive consulting firm <a href="/wiki/CNW_Marketing_Research" title="CNW Marketing Research">CNW Marketing Research</a> reported a decline in consumer interest in the Volt, citing the fires as having made an impact on consumer perception. Consumer response impelled GM to make safety enhancements to the battery system in December, and the NHTSA closed its investigation on January 20, 2012, finding the matter satisfactorily resolved with "no discernible defect trend" remaining.

They can also be combined with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regenerative_braking" title="Regenerative braking">regenerative braking</a> systems that have the ability to convert movement energy back into stored electricity. This can be used to reduce the wear on brake systems (and consequent brake pad dust) and reduce the total energy requirement of a trip. Regenerative braking is especially effective for start-and-stop city use.</p>
<p>They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from rest, unlike <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engines</a>, and do not need multiple gears to match power curves. This removes the need for <a href="/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)" title="Transmission (mechanics)">gearboxes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Torque_converter" title="Torque converter">torque converters</a>.</p>
<p>EVs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and <a href="/wiki/Vibration" title="Vibration">vibration</a> than internal combustion engines. While this is a desirable attribute, it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind, elderly and very young pedestrians. To mitigate this situation, automakers and individual companies are developing systems that produce <a href="/wiki/Electric_vehicle_warning_sounds" title="Electric vehicle warning sounds">warning sounds</a> when EVs are moving slowly, up to a speed when normal motion and rotation (road, suspension, electric motor, etc.) noises become audible.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_resilience">Energy resilience</span></h4>
<p>Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources, therefore it gives the greatest degree of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_resilience" title="Energy resilience">energy resilience</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_efficiency">Energy efficiency</span></h4>
<p>EV '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tank-to-wheel" title="Tank-to-wheel">tank-to-wheels</a>' efficiency is about a factor of 3 higher than <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine_vehicle" title="Internal combustion engine vehicle">internal combustion engine vehicles</a>. Energy is not consumed while the vehicle is stationary, unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel while idling. However, looking at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Well-to-wheel" title="Well-to-wheel">well-to-wheel</a> efficiency of EVs, their total emissions, while still lower, are closer to an efficient gasoline or diesel in most countries where electricity generation relies on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Well-to-wheel efficiency of an EV has less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity production. A particular EV would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuel to a wind or tidal primary source of energy. Thus, when "well-to-wheels" is cited, one should keep in mind that the discussion is no longer about the vehicle, but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructure - in the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration, mining, refining, and distribution.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost_of_recharge">Cost of recharge</span></h4>
<p>According to General Motors, as reported by CNN Money, the GM Volt will cost "less than purchasing a cup of your favorite coffee" to recharge. The Volt should cost less than 2 cents per mile to drive on electricity, compared with 12 cents a mile on gasoline at a price of $3.60 a gallon. This means a trip from Los Angeles to New York would cost $56 on electricity, and $336 with gasoline. This would be the equivalent to paying 60 cents a gallon of gas.</p>
<p>The reality is that the cost of operating an EV varies wildly depending on the part of the world in which the owner lives. In some locations an EV costs less to drive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, as long as the higher initial purchase-price is not factored in (i.e. a pure comparison of gasoline cost to electricity cost). In the USA, however, in states which have a tiered electricity rate schedule, "fuel" for EVs today costs owners significantly more than fuel for a comparable gas-powered vehicle. A study done by Purdue University found that in California most users already reach the third pricing tier for electricity each month, and adding an EV could push them into the fourth or fifth (highest, most expensive) tier, meaning that they will be paying in excess of $.45 cents per KWH for electricity to recharge their vehicle. At this price, which is higher than the average electricity price in the US, it is dramatically more expensive to drive a pure-EV than it is to drive a traditional pure-gas powered vehicle. "The objective of a tiered pricing system is to discourage consumption. It's meant to get you to think about turning off your lights and conserving electricity. In California, the unintended consequence is that plug-in hybrid cars won't be economical under this system," said Tyner (the author), whose findings were published in the online version of the journal Energy Policy.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stabilization_of_the_grid">Stabilization of the grid</span></h4>
<p>Since EVs can be plugged into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_grid" title="Electric grid">electric grid</a> when not in use, there is a potential for battery powered vehicles to even cut the demand for electricity by feeding electricity <i>into</i> the grid from their batteries during peak use periods (such as midafternoon air conditioning use) while doing most of their charging at night, when there is unused generating capacity. This <a href="/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid" title="Vehicle-to-grid">vehicle-to-grid</a> (V2G) connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants, as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their batteries, by being drained by the power company during peak demand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variable-output power sources such as windmills and PV solar panels. This variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV batteries are charged, or possibly even discharged.</p>
<p>Some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations, much like gas/petrol stations today. Clearly these will require enormous storage and charging potentials, which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging, and to output power during shortage periods, much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Range">Range</span></h4>
<p>Many electric designs have limited range, due to the low energy density of batteries compared to the fuel of internal combustion engined vehicles. EVs also often have long recharge times compared to the relatively fast process of refueling a tank. This is further complicated by the current scarcity of public charging stations. "<a href="/wiki/Range_anxiety" title="Range anxiety">Range anxiety</a>" is a label for consumer concern about EV range.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Heating_of_EVs">Heating of EVs</span></h4>
<p>In cold climates, considerable energy is needed to heat the interior of a vehicle and to defrost the windows. With internal combustion engines, this heat already exists as waste combustion heat diverted from the engine cooling circuit. This process offsets the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a>' external costs. If this is done with battery EVs, the interior heating requires extra energy from the vehicles' batteries. Although some heat could be harvested from the motor or motors and battery, their greater efficiency means there is not as much waste heat available as from a <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">combustion engine</a>.</p>
<p>However, for vehicles which are connected to the grid, battery EVs can be preheated, or cooled, with little or no need for battery energy, especially for short trips.</p>
<p>Newer designs are focused on using super-<a href="/wiki/Thermal_insulation" title="Thermal insulation">insulated</a> cabins which can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the passengers. This is not enough, however, in colder climates as a driver delivers only about 100 W of heating power. A <a href="/wiki/Heat_pump" title="Heat pump">heat pump</a> system, capable of cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter, seems to be the most practical and promising way of solving the thermal management of the EV. Ricardo Arboix introduced (2008) a new concept based on the principle of combining the thermal-management of the EV-battery with the thermal-management of the cabin using a heat pump system. This is done by adding a third heat-exchanger, thermally connected with the battery-core, to the traditional heat pump/air conditioning system used in previous EV-models like the GM EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV. The concept has proven to bring several benefits, such as prolonging the life-span of the battery as well as improving the performance and overall energy-efficiency of the EV.</p>

<p>Research shows people do prefer trams, because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having higher status. Therefore, it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel consumption in cities through the use of electric trams. Trams may be the most energy-efficient form of public transportation, with rubber wheeled vehicles using 2/3 more energy than the equivalent tram, and run on electricity rather than fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="/wiki/Net_present_value" title="Net present value">net present value</a>, they are also the cheapest—<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blackpool_tram" title="Blackpool tram">Blackpool trams</a> are still running after 100-years, but combustion buses only last about 15-years.</p>

<p>Many governments offer incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles, with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil consumption. Some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant. Other incentives include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes, and investment in charging infrastructure.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_batteries">Improved batteries</span></h3>
<p>First, advances in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery" title="Lithium ion battery">lithium ion batteries</a>, in large part driven by the consumer electronics industry, allow full-sized, highway-capable EVs to be propelled as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline. Lithium batteries have been made safe, can be recharged in minutes instead of hours (see <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Recharging_time" title="Rechargeable battery">recharging time</a>), and now last longer than the typical vehicle (see <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Lifespan_and_cycle_stability" title="Rechargeable battery">lifespan</a>). The production cost of these lighter, higher-capacity lithium batteries is gradually decreasing as the technology matures and production volumes increase (see <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Price_history" title="Rechargeable battery">price history</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Toyota" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> Motors Corporation is trying to replace the current lithium ion battery with <a href="/wiki/Solid-state_battery" title="Solid-state battery">solid-state battery</a> technology by 2020. The solid-state battery replaces the liquid electrolyte with a solid electrolyte.</p>
<p>Rechargeable <a href="/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93air_battery" title="Lithium–air battery">lithium-air batteries</a> potentially offer increased range over other types and are a current topic of research.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Battery_management_and_intermediate_storage">Battery management and intermediate storage</span></h3>
<p>Another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery through electronic control, employing <a href="/wiki/Supercapacitor" title="Supercapacitor">supercapacitors</a> to buffer large but short power demands and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regenerative_braking" title="Regenerative braking">regenerative braking</a> energy. The development of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak points mentioned above. The cell management involves not only monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration (one more cell than needed). With sophisticated switched wiring it is possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty.</p>
