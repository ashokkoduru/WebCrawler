<p>Early interest in the environment was a feature of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Romantic_movement" title="Romantic movement">Romantic movement</a> in the early 19th century.

<p>The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of <a href="/wiki/Smoke" title="Smoke">smoke</a> <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" title="Conservation movement">Conservation movement</a></div>

<p>The modern <a href="/wiki/Conservation_movement" title="Conservation movement">conservation movement</a> was first manifested in the forests of India, with the practical application of scientific conservation principles. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that the human activity damaged the <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">environment</a>, that there was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civic_duty" title="Civic duty">civic duty</a> to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir <a href="/wiki/James_Ranald_Martin" title="James Ranald Martin">James Ranald Martin</a> was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_India" title="British India">British India</a> through the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Indian_Forest_Service" title="Indian Forest Service">Forest Departments</a>. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Madras" title="Madras">Madras</a> <a href="/wiki/Board_of_Revenue" title="Board of Revenue">Board of Revenue</a> started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Gibson_(botanist)" title="Alexander Gibson (botanist)">Alexander Gibson</a>, a professional <a href="/wiki/Botany" title="Botany">botanist</a> who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world. Eventually, the government under <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_India" title="Governor-General of India">Governor-General</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Broun-Ramsay,_1st_Marquess_of_Dalhousie" title="James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie">Lord Dalhousie</a> introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_empire" title="British empire">other colonies</a>, as well the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. In 1860, the Department banned the use <a href="/wiki/Shifting_cultivation" title="Shifting cultivation">shifting cultivation</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hugh_Francis_Cleghorn" title="Hugh Francis Cleghorn">Dr. Hugh Cleghorn</a>'s 1861 manual, <i>The forests and gardens of South India</i>, became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.</p>
<p>Sir <a href="/wiki/Dietrich_Brandis" title="Dietrich Brandis">Dietrich Brandis</a> joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern <a href="/wiki/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Burma</a>. During that time Burma's <a href="/wiki/Teak" title="Teak">teak</a> forests were controlled by militant <a href="/wiki/Karen_people" title="Karen people">Karen</a> tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system, in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Imperial_Forestry_School_(India)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Imperial Forestry School (India) (page does not exist)">Imperial Forest School</a> at <a href="/wiki/Dehradun" title="Dehradun">Dehradun</a> was founded by him.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Formation_of_environmental_protection_societies">Formation of environmental protection societies</span></h3>
<p>The late 19th century saw the formation of the first wildlife conservation societies. The zoologist <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Newton" title="Alfred Newton">Alfred Newton</a> published a series of investigations into the <i>Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals</i> between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Protection_of_Birds" title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds">Plumage League</a> (later the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) in 1889. The society acted as a <a href="/wiki/Advocacy_group" title="Advocacy group">protest group</a> campaigning against the use of <a href="/wiki/Great_crested_grebe" title="Great crested grebe">great crested grebe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black-legged_kittiwake" title="Black-legged kittiwake">kittiwake</a> skins and feathers in <a href="/wiki/Fur_clothing" title="Fur clothing">fur clothing</a>. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes, and influenced the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Sea_Birds_Preservation_Act_1869" title="Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869">Sea Birds Preservation Act</a> in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.</p>
<p>For most of the century from 1850 to 1950, however, the primary environmental cause was the mitigation of air pollution. The <a href="/wiki/Environmental_Protection_UK" title="Environmental Protection UK">Coal Smoke Abatement Society</a> was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir <a href="/wiki/William_Blake_Richmond" title="William Blake Richmond">William Blake Richmond</a>, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the <a href="/wiki/Public_Health_Act_1875" title="Public Health Act 1875">Public Health Act 1875</a> required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke.</p>

<p>Systematic and general efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a>, the growth of cities, and worsening air and <a href="/wiki/Water_pollution" title="Water pollution">water pollution</a>. Starting with the formation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commons_Preservation_Society" title="Commons Preservation Society">Commons Preservation Society</a> in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hunter_(National_Trust)" title="Robert Hunter (National Trust)">Robert Hunter</a>, solicitor for the society, worked with <a href="/wiki/Hardwicke_Rawnsley" title="Hardwicke Rawnsley">Hardwicke Rawnsley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Octavia_Hill" title="Octavia Hill">Octavia Hill</a>, and <a href="/wiki/John_Ruskin" title="John Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of <a href="/wiki/Newlands_Valley" title="Newlands Valley">Newlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ennerdale_Water" title="Ennerdale Water">Ennerdale</a>. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).</p>
<p>In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the "<a href="/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" title="National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty">National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty</a>" was formally inaugurated in 1894. The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation. and the bill was passed in August 1907.</p>
<p>An early "Back-to-Nature" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as <a href="/wiki/John_Ruskin" title="John Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Morris" title="William Morris">William Morris</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Carpenter" title="Edward Carpenter">Edward Carpenter</a>, who were all against <a href="/wiki/Consumerism" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> and other activities that were harmful to the natural world. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical <a href="/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia">Utopia</a> and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a <i>small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.</i></p>
<p>Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the "taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality", were enthusiastically revived, including the <a href="/wiki/Morris_dance" title="Morris dance">Morris dance</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Maypole" title="Maypole">maypole</a>.</p>

<p>The movement in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as <a href="/wiki/John_Muir" title="John Muir">John Muir</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book <i><a href="/wiki/Walden" title="Walden">Walden</a></i>, which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in <a href="/wiki/Yosemite_Valley" title="Yosemite Valley">Yosemite Valley</a> and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form <a href="/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park" title="Yosemite National Park">Yosemite National Park</a> and went on to set up the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Club" title="Sierra Club">Sierra Club</a> in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism. However, the early movement in the U.S. developed with a contradiction; preservationists like <a href="/wiki/John_Muir" title="John Muir">John Muir</a> wanted land and nature set aside for its own sake, and conservationists, such as <a href="/wiki/Gifford_Pinchot" title="Gifford Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a> (appointed as the first Chief of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_Forest_Service" title="US Forest Service">US Forest Service</a> from 1905-1910), wanted to manage natural resources for human use.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>
<p>In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the <a href="/wiki/American_bison" title="American bison">American bison</a>. The death of the last <a href="/wiki/Passenger_pigeon" title="Passenger pigeon">passenger pigeon</a> as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916 the <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Service" title="National Park Service">National Park Service</a> was founded by US President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>. Pioneers of the movement called for more efficient and professional management of natural resources. They fought for reform because they believed the destruction of forests, fertile soil, minerals, wildlife and water resources would lead to the downfall of society. The group that has been the most active in recent years is the <a href="/wiki/Climate_movement" title="Climate movement">climate movement</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S movement did not really take off until after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> as people began to recognize the costs of environmental negligence, disease, and widespread air and water pollution through the occurrence of several environmental disasters that occurred post-World War II. <a href="/wiki/Aldo_Leopold" title="Aldo Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a> wrote "<a href="/wiki/A_Sand_County_Almanac" title="A Sand County Almanac">A Sand County Almanac</a>" in the 1940s. He believed in a land ethic that recognized that maintaining the "beauty, integrity, and health of natural systems" as a moral and ethical imperative.</p>
<p>Another important book in the promotion of the environmental movement was <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a>" about declining bird populations due to <a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>, an insecticide, pollution and man's attempts to control nature through use of synthetic substances. Both of these books helped bring the issues into the public eye  Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" sold over two million copies.</p>

<p>The first <a href="/wiki/Earth_Day" title="Earth Day">Earth Day</a> was celebrated on 22 April 1970. Its founder, former Wisconsin Senator, <a href="/wiki/Gaylord_Nelson" title="Gaylord Nelson">Gaylord Nelson</a> was inspired to create this day of environmental education and awareness after seeing the oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> was created in 1971 as an organization that believed that political advocacy and legislation were ineffective or inefficient solutions and supported non-violent action. 1980 saw the creation of <a href="/wiki/Earth_First!" title="Earth First!">Earth First!</a>, a group with an <a href="/wiki/Ecocentrism" title="Ecocentrism">ecocentric</a> view of the world – believing in equality between the rights of humans to flourish, the rights of all other species to flourish and the rights of life-sustaining systems to flourish.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, several events illustrated the magnitude of environmental damage caused by humans. In 1954, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb" title="Hydrogen bomb">hydrogen bomb</a> test at <a href="/wiki/Bikini_Atoll" title="Bikini Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> exposed the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Daigo_Fukury%C5%AB_Maru" title="Daigo Fukuryū Maru">Lucky Dragon 5</a></i> to radioactive fallout. In 1967 the oil tanker <a href="/wiki/SS_Torrey_Canyon" title="SS Torrey Canyon"><i>Torrey Canyon</i></a> ran aground off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, and in 1969 oil spilled from an offshore well in California's <a href="/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Channel" title="Santa Barbara Channel">Santa Barbara Channel</a>. In 1971, the conclusion of a lawsuit in <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> drew international attention to the effects of decades of <a href="/wiki/Mercury_poisoning" title="Mercury poisoning">mercury poisoning</a> on the people of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minamata" title="Minamata">Minamata</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, emerging scientific research drew new attention to existing and hypothetical threats to the environment and humanity. Among them were <a href="/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich" title="Paul R. Ehrlich">Paul R. Ehrlich</a>, whose book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Population_Bomb" title="The Population Bomb">The Population Bomb</a></i> (1968) revived <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus">Malthusian</a> concerns about the impact of exponential population growth. Biologist <a href="/wiki/Barry_Commoner" title="Barry Commoner">Barry Commoner</a> generated a debate about growth, affluence and "flawed technology." Additionally, an association of scientists and political leaders known as the <a href="/wiki/Club_of_Rome" title="Club of Rome">Club of Rome</a> published their report <i><a href="/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth" title="The Limits to Growth">The Limits to Growth</a></i> in 1972, and drew attention to the growing pressure on natural resources from human activities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, technological accomplishments such as <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> and photos of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> from <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">outer space</a> provided both new insights and new reasons for concern over Earth's seemingly small and unique place in the universe.</p>
<p>In 1972, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_the_Human_Environment" title="United Nations Conference on the Human Environment">United Nations Conference on the Human Environment</a> was held in <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, and for the first time united the representatives of multiple governments in discussion relating to the state of the global environment. This conference led directly to the creation of government environmental agencies and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Environment_Program" title="UN Environment Program">UN Environment Program</a>.</p>
<p>By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence. Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization the <a href="/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement" title="Anti-nuclear movement">anti-nuclear movement</a>'s efforts gained a great deal of attention, especially in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and United States. In the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Three Mile Island accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> in 1979, many mass demonstrations took place. The largest one was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved 200,000 people.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, public awareness, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environmental sciences</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, and technology have advanced to include modern focus points like <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> depletion, <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global climate change</a>, <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, and the potentially harmful <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_organisms" title="Genetically modified organisms">genetically modified organisms</a> (GMOs).</p>

<p>After the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Environmental_Conference_in_Stockholm" title="International Environmental Conference in Stockholm">International Environmental Conference in Stockholm</a> in 1972 Latin American officials returned with a high hope of growth and protection of the fairly untouched natural resources.

In 1972, in Stockholm, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment created the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Environment_Programme" title="UN Environment Programme">UN Environment Programme</a>. The EU's environmental policy was formally founded by a <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> declaration and the first five-year environment programme was adopted. The main idea of the declaration was that prevention is better than the cure and the polluter should pay. 1979 saw the partial meltdown of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island" title="Three Mile Island">Three Mile Island</a> in the USA.</p>
<p>In the 1980s the green parties that were created a decade before began to have some political success.. In 1986, there was a nuclear accident in <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl" title="Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a>, Ukraine. The end of the 1980s and start of the 1990s saw the fall of communism across central and Eastern Europe, the fall of the [Berlin Wall], and the Union of East and West Germany. In 1992 there was a UN summit held in Rio de Janeiro where <a href="/wiki/Agenda_21" title="Agenda 21">Agenda 21</a> was adopted. The <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> was created in 1997 which set specific targets and deadlines to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 2000s activists believed that environmental policy concerns were overshadowed by energy security, globalism, and terrorism.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_East">Middle East</span></h3>
<p>The environmental movement is reaching the less developed world with different degrees of success. The <a href="/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, has different adaptations of the environmental movement. Countries on the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Gulf" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> have high incomes and rely heavily on the large amount of energy resources in the area. Each country in the Arab world has varying combinations of low or high amounts of natural resources and low or high amounts of labor.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/League_of_Arab_States" title="League of Arab States">League of Arab States</a> has one specialized sub-committee, of 12 standing specialized subcommittee in the Foreign Affairs Ministerial Committees, which deals with Environmental Issues. Countries in the League of Arab States have demonstrated an interest in environmental issue, on paper some environmental activists have doubts about the level of commitment to environmental issues;; being a part of the world community may have obliged these countries to portray concern for the environment. Initial level of environmental awareness may be the creation of a ministry of the environment. The year of establishment of a ministry is also indicative of level of engagement. Saudi Arabia was the first to establish environmental law in 1992 followed by Egypt in 1994. Somalia is the only country without environmental law. In 2010 the Environmental Performance Index listed Algeria as the top Arab country at 42 of 163; Morocco was at 52 and Syria at 56. The <a href="/wiki/Environmental_Performance_Index" title="Environmental Performance Index">Environmental Performance Index</a> measures the ability of a country to actively manage and protect their environment and the health of their citizens. A weighted index is created by giving 50% weight for environmental health objective (health) and 50% for ecosystem vitality (ecosystem); values range from 0-100. No Arab countries were in the top quartile, and 7 countries were in the lowest quartile.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="South_Korea_and_Taiwan">South Korea and Taiwan</span></h3>
<p>South Korea and Taiwan experienced similar growth in industrialization from 1965-1990 with few environmental controls. South Korea's <a href="/wiki/Han_River_(Korea)" title="Han River (Korea)">Han River</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nakdong_River" title="Nakdong River">Nakdong River</a> were so polluted by unchecked dumping of industrial waste that they were close to being classified as biologically dead. Taiwan's formula for balanced growth was to prevent industrial concentration and encourage manufacturers to set up in the countryside. This led to 20% of the farmland being polluted by industrial waste and 30% of the rice grown on the island was contaminated with heavy metals. Both countries had spontaneous environmental movements drawing participants from different classes. Their demands were linked with issues of employment, occupational health, and agricultural crisis. They were also quite militant; the people learned that protesting can bring results. The polluting factories were forced to make immediate improvements of the conditions or pay compensation to victims. Some were even forced to shut down or move locations. The people were able to force the government to come out with new restrictive rules on toxins, industrial waste, and air pollution. All of these new regulations caused the migration of those polluting industries from Taiwan and South Korea to China and other countries in Southeast Asia with more relaxed environmental laws.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="China">China</span></h3>
<p>China's environmental movement is characterized by spontaneous alliances that often only occur at the local level. The Chinese have realized the ability of riots and protests to have success and had led to an increase in disputes in China by 30% since 2005 to more than 50,000 events. Protests cover topics such as environmental issues, land-loss, income, and political issues. They have also grown in size from about 10 people or fewer in the mid-1990s to 52 people per incident in 2004. China has more relaxed environmental laws than other countries in Asia, so many polluting factories have relocated to China causing pollution in China. Water pollution, water scarcity, soil pollution, soil degradation, and desertification are issues currently in discussion in China. The groundwater table of the <a href="/wiki/North_China_Plain" title="North China Plain">North China Plain</a> is dropping by 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. This groundwater table occurs in the region of China that produces 40% of the country's grain.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="India">India</span></h3>
<p>Environmental and public health is an ongoing struggle within India. The first seed of an environmental movement in India was the foundation in 1964 of <i>Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh</i>, a labour coperative started by <a href="/wiki/Chandi_Prasad_Bhatt" title="Chandi Prasad Bhatt">Chandi Prasad Bhatt</a>. It was inaugurated by <a href="/wiki/Sucheta_Kriplani" title="Sucheta Kriplani">Sucheta Kriplani</a> and founded on a land donated by Shyma Devi. This initiative was eventually followed up with the <a href="/wiki/Chipko_movement" title="Chipko movement">Chipko movement</a> starting in 1974.</p>
<p>The most severe single event underpinning the movement was the <a href="/wiki/Bhopal_disaster" title="Bhopal disaster">Bhopal gas leakage</a> on 3 December 1984. 40 tons of <a href="/wiki/Methyl_isocyanate" title="Methyl isocyanate">methyl isocyanate</a> was released, immediately killing 2,259 people and ultimately affecting 700,000 citizens.</p>
<p>India has a national campaign against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coca_Cola" title="Coca Cola">Coca Cola</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pepsi_Cola" title="Pepsi Cola">Pepsi Cola</a> plants due to their practices of drawing ground water and contaminating fields with sludge. The movement is characterized by local struggles against intensive aquaculture farms. The most influential part of the environmental movement in India is the anti-dam movement. Dam creation has been thought of as a way for India to catch up with the West by connecting to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_grid" title="Power grid">power grid</a> with giant dams, coal or oil-powered plants, or nuclear plants. Jhola Aandolan a mass <a href="/wiki/Social_movement" title="Social movement">movement</a> is conducting as fighting against <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" title="Polyethylene">polyethylene</a> carry bags uses and promoting cloth/jute/paper carry bags to protect environment &amp; <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>.
