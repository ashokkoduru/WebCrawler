<p><b>Adaptation</b> is a response to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> and <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, that seeks to reduce the <a href="/wiki/Vulnerability" title="Vulnerability">vulnerability</a> of social and biological systems to relatively sudden change and thus offset the <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">effects of global warming</a>. Even if emissions are stabilized relatively soon, global warming and its effects will last many years, and adaptation will be necessary to the resulting changes in climate. Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming. That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_capacity" title="Adaptive capacity">adaptive capacity</a>) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt (<a href="/wiki/Stephen_Schneider" title="Stephen Schneider">Schneider</a> <i>et al.</i>, 2007). Furthermore, the degree of adaptation correlates to the situational focus on environmental issues. Therefore, adaptation requires the situational assessment of sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental impacts. Adaptive capacity is closely linked to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_development" title="Social development">social</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a> (IPCC, 2007). The economic costs of adaptation to climate change are likely to cost billions of dollars annually for the next several decades, though the amount of money needed is unknown. Donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the <a href="/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund" title="Green Climate Fund">Green Climate Fund</a> for developing countries to adapt to climate change. However, while the fund was set up during <a href="/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference" title="2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference">COP16 in Cancún</a>, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming. The adaptation challenge grows with the magnitude and the rate of climate change.</p>
<p>Another policy response to climate change, known as <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">climate change mitigation</a> (Verbruggen, 2007) is to reduce <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> (GHG) emissions and/or enhance the removal of these gases from <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="Atmosphere of Earth">the atmosphere</a> (through <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sink" title="Carbon sink">carbon sinks</a>). Even the most effective reductions in emissions, however, would not prevent further climate change impacts, making the need for adaptation unavoidable (Klein <i>et al.</i>, 2007). In a literature assessment, Klein <i>et al.</i> (2007) assessed options for adaptation. They concluded, with very high confidence, that in the absence of mitigation efforts, the effects of climate change would reach such a magnitude as to make adaptation impossible for some natural <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>. Others are concerned that climate adaptation programs might interfere with the existing development programs and thus lead to unintended consequences for vulnerable groups  For human systems, the economic and <a href="/wiki/Social_cost" title="Social cost">social costs</a> of unmitigated climate change would be very high.</p>

<p>The projected effects for the <a href="/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)" title="Environment (biophysical)">environment</a> and for <a href="/wiki/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilization</a> are numerous and varied. The main effect is an increasing global average temperature. The average surface temperature could increase by 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if carbon emissions aren't reduced. This causes a variety of secondary effects, namely, changes in patterns of precipitation, rising sea levels, <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture" title="Climate change and agriculture">altered patterns of agriculture</a>, increased <a href="/wiki/Extreme_weather" title="Extreme weather">extreme weather</a> events, the expansion of the range of tropical diseases, and the opening of new marine trade routes.</p>

The 2007 contribution of Working Group II detailing the impacts of global warming for the <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">IPCC Fourth Assessment Report</a> has been summarized for policymakers.</p>
<p>Adaptation is handicapped by uncertainty over the effects of global warming on specific locations such as the <a href="/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">Southwestern United States</a> or phenomena such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indian_monsoon" title="Indian monsoon">Indian monsoon</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Complementary_to_mitigation">Complementary to mitigation</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">IPCC</a> Working Group II, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences" title="United States National Academy of Sciences">United States National Academy of Sciences</a>, the United Nations Disaster Risk Reduction Office, and other science policy experts agree that while mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases is important, adaptation to the effects of global warming will still be necessary. Some, like the UK <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers" title="Institution of Mechanical Engineers">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a>, worry that mitigation efforts will largely fail. The IPCC group points out that the world's ability to mitigate global warming is an economic and political challenge. Given that greenhouse gas levels are already elevated, the lag of decades between emissions and some impacts, and the significant economic and political challenges of success, the IPCC group points out that it is uncertain how much climate change <i>will</i> be mitigated.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">Developing countries</a> are the least able to adapt to climate change. Doing so depends on such factors as wealth, technology, education, infrastructure, access to resources, management capabilities, acceptance of the existence of climate change and the consequent need for action, and sociopolitical will.</p>
<p>Yohe <i>et al.</i> (2007) assessed the literature on sustainability and climate change. With high confidence, they suggested that up to the year 2050, an effort to cap GHG emissions at 550 ppm would benefit developing countries significantly. This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant climate change impacts. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>The IPCC group also pointed out that climate change adaptation measures can reinforce and be reinforced by efforts to promote <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> and reduce poverty.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost_of_adaptation_vs._mitigation">Cost of adaptation vs. mitigation</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Economics_of_global_warming#Trade_offs" title="Economics of global warming">Economics of global warming § Trade offs</a></div>
<p>Adaptation and mitigation can be viewed as two competing policy responses, with tradeoffs between the two. The other tradeoff is with climate change impacts. In practice, however, the actual tradeoffs are debatable (Schneider <i>et al.</i>, 2001). This is because the people who bear emission reduction costs or benefits are often different from those who pay or benefit from adaptation measures.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Economist" title="Economist">Economists</a>, using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a>, have attempted to calculate an "optimal" balance of the costs and benefits between climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation (Toth <i>et al.</i>, 2001). There are difficulties in doing this calculation, for example, future climate change damages are uncertain, as are the future costs of adaptation.</p>
<p>Also, deciding what "optimal" is depends on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Value_judgement" title="Value judgement">value judgements</a> made by the economist doing the study (Azar, 1998). For example, how to value impacts occurring in different regions and different times, and "non-market" impacts, e.g., damages to ecosystems (Smith <i>et al.</i>, 2001). Economics cannot provide definitive answers to these questions over valuation, and some valuations may be viewed as being controversial (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 87, 99).</p>
<p>Some reviews indicate that policymakers are uncomfortable with using the results of this type of economic analysis (Klein <i>et al.</i>, 2007). This is due to the uncertainties surrounding cost estimates for climate change damages, adaptation, and mitigation. Another type of analysis is based on a <a href="/wiki/Risk" title="Risk">risk</a>-based approach to the problem. Stern (2007) (referred to by Klein <i>et al.</i>, 2007), for example, used such an approach. He argued that adaptation would play an important role in climate policy, but not in an explicit trade-off against mitigation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost_estimates_and_international_aid">Cost estimates and international aid</span></h3>
<p>Many scientists, policy makers, and the <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Fourth Assessment Report">IPCC Fourth Assessment Report</a> have agreed that disadvantaged nations need to do more to adapt to climate change, especially highly populated regions of the <a href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a> with low <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_capacity" title="Adaptive capacity">adaptive capacity</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme" title="United Nations Development Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> estimated that an additional USD $86 billion per year would be needed in 2015.</p>
<p>According to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFCCC" title="UNFCCC">UNFCCC</a> estimates in 2007, costs of adaptation to climate change would cost $49–171 billion per annum globally by 2030, of which a significant share of the additional investment and financial flows, USD $28–67 billion would be needed in 2030 in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-Annex_I_Parties" title="Non-Annex I Parties">non-Annex I Parties</a>. This represents a doubling of current <a href="/wiki/Official_development_assistance" title="Official development assistance">official development assistance</a> (ODA).</p>
<p>This estimate has been critiqued by Parry <i>et al.</i> (2009), in a joint study by IIED and the Grantham Institute, which argues that the UNFCCC estimate underestimates the cost of adaptation to climate change by a factor of 2 or 3. Moreover, sectors such as tourism, mining, energy, and retail were not included in the UNFCCC estimate.</p>
<p>The more recent World Bank Study, "Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change", found that the costs of adaptation would be in the range of $75–100 billion per year between 2010 and 2050; with higher estimates under the wetter global scenario than the drier scenario, assuming that warming will be about 2 degrees by 2050.</p>
<p>The benefits of strong, early action on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming" title="Mitigation of global warming">mitigation</a> considerably outweigh the costs. The <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord" title="Copenhagen Accord">Copenhagen Accord</a> was agreed on in order to create a commitment by developed countries to provide:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>new and additional resources...approaching USD $30 billion for the period 2010- 2012 with balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation... [and] in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, developed countries commit to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD$100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord" title="Copenhagen Accord">Copenhagen Accord</a></cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a key point of contention between states at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFCC" title="UNFCC">UNFCC</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Climate_Summit" title="Copenhagen Climate Summit">Copenhagen Climate Summit</a> was who was to foot the bill and if aid is to be given, how is it to affect other levels of <a href="/wiki/Development_aid" title="Development aid">development aid</a>. The concept of <b>additionality</b> has thus arisen and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a> has asked its member states to come up with definitions of what they understand additionality to mean, the four main definitions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals#Controversy_over_funding_of_0.7.25_of_GNI" title="Millennium Development Goals">0.7% ODA target</a>;</li>
<li>Increase on previous year's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Official_Development_Assistance" title="Official Development Assistance">Official Development Assistance</a> (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;</li>
<li>Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and</li>
<li>Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main point being that there is a conflict between the OECD states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International_aid_mechanisms">International aid mechanisms</span></h3>
<p>As of 2010, the aggregate of current climate change adaptation programs will not raise enough money to fund adaptation to climate change. There are, however, several programs and proposals to finance adaptation to climate change in developing countries. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) runs a program called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_Environmental_Facility" title="Global Environmental Facility">Global Environmental Facility</a>, which provides some funding for adaptation to least developed countries and small island states. Under the GEF umbrella, the GEF Trust Fund, the <a class="external text" href="http://www.thegef.org/gef/LDCF" rel="nofollow">Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)</a>, and the <a class="external text" href="http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/special_climate_change_fund/items/3657.php" rel="nofollow">Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)</a> operate to carry out the climate change adaptation financing goals of the GEF.</p>
<p>Another UNFCCC mechanism is <a href="/wiki/The_Adaptation_Fund" title="The Adaptation Fund">The Adaptation Fund</a>, as a result of negotiations during <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COP15" title="COP15">COP15</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COP16" title="COP16">COP16</a>, which provides funds for projects that prove to have additional benefits for adaptation to climate change. The <a href="/wiki/Clean_Development_Mechanism" title="Clean Development Mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism</a> (CDM), set up as part of the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> to the Framework Convention, is the main source of income for the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. This fund was established in 2007 (World Bank, 2010, pp. 262–263). The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300 million and $600 million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price. As of August 2010, The Adaptation Fund has not yet disbursed any funding; a call for proposals was issued in April 2010. UNFCCC funding for Least Developed Countries includes development of a <a href="/wiki/National_Adaptation_Programme_of_Action" title="National Adaptation Programme of Action">National Adaptation Programme of Action</a>, which prioritizes requests to fund specific adaptation projects.</p>
<p>There are several other climate change adaptation finance proposals, most of which employ <a href="/wiki/Official_development_assistance" title="Official development assistance">official development assistance</a> or ODA. These proposals range from a World Bank program, to proposals involving auctioning of carbon allowances, to a global carbon or transportation tax, to compensation-based funding. Other proposals suggest using market-based mechanisms, rather than ODA, such as the Higher Ground Foundation's vulnerability reduction credit (VRC™) or a program similar to the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Development_Mechanism" title="Clean Development Mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism</a>, to raise private money for climate change adaptation. The <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord" title="Copenhagen Accord">Copenhagen Accord</a>, the most recent global climate change agreement, commits developed countries to goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries in assistance for climate change mitigation and adaptation through 2020. This agreement, while not binding, would dwarf current amounts dedicated to adaptation in developing countries. This climate change fund is called the <a href="/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund" title="Green Climate Fund">Green Climate Fund</a> from the <a href="/wiki/2010_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference" title="2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference">2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Integration_with_development_aid">Integration with development aid</span></h3>
<p>Many developing such countries attach higher priority to economic development than climate change, concerned about pre-existing problems such as poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity, availability of drinking water, indebtness, illiteracy, unemployment, local resource conflicts, and lower technological development. On the other hand, climate change threatens to exacerbate or stall progress on fixing some of these pre-existing problems. Advocates have thus proposed integrating climate change adaptation into poverty reduction programs, preferably in a manner inclusionary of women and other marginalized groups.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_for_effective_policy">Principles for effective policy</span></h3>
<p>Scheraga and Grambsch identify 9 fundamental principles to be considered when designing adaptation policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>The effects of climate change vary by region.</li>
<li>The effects of climate change may vary across demographic groups.</li>
<li>Climate change poses both risks and opportunities.</li>
<li>The effects of climate change must be considered in the context of multiple stressors and factors, which may be as important to the design of adaptive responses as the sensitivity of the change.</li>
<li>Adaptation comes at a cost.</li>
<li>Adaptive responses vary in effectiveness, as demonstrated by current efforts to cope with climate variability.</li>
<li>The systemic nature of climate impacts complicates the development of adaptation policy.</li>
<li>Maladaptation can result in negative effects that are as serious as the climate-induced effects that are being avoided.</li>
<li>Many opportunities for adaptation make sense whether or not the effects of climate change are realized.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adaptation can mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change, but it will incur costs and will not prevent all damage. The IPCC points out that many adverse effects of climate change are not changes in the average conditions, but changes in the variation or the extremes of conditions. For example, the average sea level in a port might not be as important as the level during a storm (which causes flooding); the average rainfall in an area might not be as important has how frequent and severe droughts become.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Criteria_for_assessing_responses">Criteria for assessing responses</span></h3>
<p>James Titus, project manager for sea level rise at the U.S. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, identifies the following criteria that policy makers should use in assessing responses to global warming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic <a href="/wiki/Efficiency" title="Efficiency">Efficiency</a>: Will the initiative yield benefits substantially greater than if the resources were applied elsewhere?</li>
<li>Flexibility: Is the strategy reasonable for the entire range of possible changes in temperatures, precipitation, and sea level?</li>
<li>Urgency: Would the strategy be successful if implementation were delayed ten or twenty years?</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_cost" title="Low cost">Low Cost</a>: Does the strategy require minimal resources?</li>
<li>Equity: Does the strategy unfairly benefit some at the expense of other regions, generations, or economic classes?</li>
<li>Institutional feasibility: Is the strategy acceptable to the public? Can it be implemented with existing institutions under existing laws?</li>
<li>Unique or Critical Resources: Would the strategy decrease the risk of losing unique environmental or cultural resources?</li>
<li>Health and Safety: Would the proposed strategy increase or decrease the risk of disease or injury?</li>
<li>Consistency: Does the policy support other national state, community, or private goals?</li>
<li>Private v. Public Sector: Does the strategy minimize governmental interference with decisions best made by the private sector?</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Differing_time_scales">Differing time scales</span></h3>
<p>Adaptation can either occur in anticipation of change (anticipatory adaptation), or be a response to those changes (reactive adaptation). Most adaptation being implemented at present is responding to current climate trends and variability, for example increased use of <a href="/wiki/Snowmaking" title="Snowmaking">artificial snow-making</a> in the European Alps. Some adaptation measures, however, are anticipating future climate change, such as the construction of the Confederation Bridge in Canada at a higher elevation to take into account the effect of future sea-level rise on ship clearance under the bridge.</p>
<p>Much adaptation takes place in relation to short-term climate variability, however this may cause <a href="/wiki/Maladaptation" title="Maladaptation">maladaptation</a> to longer-term climatic trends. For example, the expansion of irrigation in Egypt into the Western Sinai desert due to a period of higher river flows is a maladaptation when viewed in relation to the longer term projections of drying in the region). Adaptations at one scale can also create externalities at another by reducing the adaptive capacity of other actors. This is often the case when broad assessments of the costs and benefits of adaptation are examined at smaller scales and it is possible to see that whilst the adaptation may benefit some actors, it has a negative effect on others.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Traditional_coping_strategies">Traditional coping strategies</span></h3>
<p>From the current literature on the subject, people have always adapted to a changing climate and that coping strategies already exist in many communities, for example changing sowing times or adopting new water-saving techniques. Traditional knowledge and coping strategies must be maintained and strengthened, otherwise adaptive capacity may be weakened as local knowledge of the environment is lost. Strengthening these indigenous techniques and building upon them also makes it more likely that adaptation strategies will be adopted, as it creates more community ownership and involvement in the process. In some cases however this will be not be enough to adapt to new conditions which are outside the range of those previously experienced, and new techniques will be needed.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Methods_of_adaptation">Methods of adaptation</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Local_adaptation_efforts">Local adaptation efforts</span></h3>
<p>Cities, states, and provinces often have considerable responsibility in land use planning, public health, and disaster management. Some have begun to take steps to adapt to threats intensified by climate change, such as flooding, bushfires, heatwaves, and rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>By installing protective and/ or resilient technologies and materials in properties that are prone to flooding</li>
<li>Changing to heat tolerant tree varieties (Chicago)</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rainwater_storage" title="Rainwater storage">Rainwater storage</a> to deal with more frequent flooding rainfall - Changing to water <a href="/wiki/Permeable_paving" title="Permeable paving">permeable pavements</a>, adding water-buffering vegetation, adding underground storage tanks, subsidizing household <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rain_barrel" title="Rain barrel">rain barrels</a> (Chicago)</li>

<li>Surveying local vulnerabilities, raising public awareness, and making climate change-specific planning tools like future flood maps (Seattle, Chicago, Norfolk, many others)</li>
<li>Incentivizing lighter-colored roofs to reduce the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_island_effect" title="Heat island effect">heat island effect</a> (Chula Vista, California)</li>

<li>Buying out homeowners in flood-prone areas (New Jersey)</li>
<li>Raising street level to prevent flooding (Miami Beach)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dealing with more frequent drenching rains may required increasing the capacity of <a href="/wiki/Stormwater" title="Stormwater">stormwater</a> systems, and separating stormwater from <a href="/wiki/Blackwater_(waste)" title="Blackwater (waste)">blackwater</a>, so that overflows in peak periods do not contaminate rivers. One example is the <a href="/wiki/SMART_Tunnel" title="SMART Tunnel">SMART Tunnel</a> in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/English_Nature" title="English Nature">English Nature</a>, gardeners can help mitigate the effects of climate change by providing habitats for the most threatened species, and/or saving water by changing gardens to use plants which require less.</p>
<p>New York City produced a comprehensive report for its Rebuilding and Resiliency initiative after <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy" title="Hurricane Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>. Its efforts include not only making buildings less prone flooding, but taking steps to reduce the future recurrence of specific problems encountered during and after the storm: weeks-long fuel shortages even in unaffected areas due to legal and transportation problems, flooded health care facilities, insurance premium increases, damage to electricity and steam generation in addition to distribution networks, and flooding of subway and roadway tunnels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Enhancing_adaptive_capacity">Enhancing adaptive capacity</span></h3>
<p>Adaptation can be defined as adjustments of a system to reduce <a href="/wiki/Vulnerability" title="Vulnerability">vulnerability</a> and to increase the resilience of a system to change, also known as <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_capacity" title="Adaptive capacity">adaptive capacity</a>. Those societies that can respond to change quickly and successfully have a high adaptive capacity. High adaptive capacity does not necessarily translate into successful adaptation. For example, the adaptive capacity in Western Europe is high, and the risks of warmer winters increasing the range of livestock diseases was well documented, but many parts of Europe were still badly affected by outbreaks of the <a href="/wiki/Bluetongue_disease" title="Bluetongue disease">Bluetongue virus</a> in livestock in 2007.</p>
<p>In a literature assessment, Smit <i>et al.</i> (2001) concluded that enhanced adaptive capacity would reduce vulnerability to climate change. In their view, activities that enhance adaptive capacity are essentially equivalent to activities that promote <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>. These activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving access to resources</li>
<li>Reducing <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a></li>
<li>Lowering inequities of resources and wealth among groups</li>
<li>Improving <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a> and information</li>
<li>Improving <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a></li>
<li>Improving <a href="/wiki/Institutional_economics" title="Institutional economics">institutional</a> capacity and efficiency</li>
<li>Promoting <a class="external text" href="http://www.unesco.org/most/bpikpub.htm" rel="nofollow">local indigenous practices</a>, knowledge, and experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>Others have suggested that certain forms of gender inequity should be addressed at the same time; for example women may have participation in decision-making, or be constrained by lower levels of education.</p>
<p>Researchers at the <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> found that development interventions to increase adaptive capacity have tended not to result in increased <a href="/wiki/Agency_(sociology)" title="Agency (sociology)">agency</a> for local people. They argue that this should play a more prominent part in future intervention planning because agency is a central factor in all other aspects of adaptive capacity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agricultural_production">Agricultural production</span></h3>
<p>A significant effect of global climate change is the altering of global rainfall patterns, with certain effects on agriculture. Rainfed agriculture constitutes 80% of global agriculture. Many of the 852 million poor people in the world live in parts of Asia and Africa that depend on rainfall to cultivate food crops. Climate change will modify <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rainfall" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a>, <a href="/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" title="Surface runoff">runoff</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soil_moisture" title="Soil moisture">soil moisture</a> storage. Extended drought can cause the failure of small and marginal farms with resultant economic, political and social disruption, moreso than this currently occurs.</p>
<p>Agriculture of any kind is strongly influenced by the availability of water. Changes in total <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seasonal_precipitation" title="Seasonal precipitation">seasonal precipitation</a> or in its pattern of variability are both important. The occurrence of <a href="/wiki/Moisture_stress" title="Moisture stress">moisture stress</a> during <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flowering" title="Flowering">flowering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pollination" title="Pollination">pollination</a>, and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Grain-filling&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Grain-filling (page does not exist)">grain-filling</a> is harmful to most crops and particularly so to <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soybeans" title="Soybeans">soybeans</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>. Increased <a href="/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a> from the soil and accelerated <a href="/wiki/Transpiration" title="Transpiration">transpiration</a> in the plants themselves will cause moisture stress.</p>
<p>Adaptive ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking advantage of global transportation systems to delivering surplus food to where it is needed (though this does not help subsistence farmers unless aid is given).</li>
<li>Developing crop varieties with greater <a href="/wiki/Drought_tolerance" title="Drought tolerance">drought tolerance</a>.</li>
<li>Rainwater storage. For example, according to the <a href="/wiki/International_Water_Management_Institute" title="International Water Management Institute">International Water Management Institute</a>, using small planting basins to 'harvest' water in Zimbabwe has been shown to boost maize yields, whether rainfall is abundant or scarce. And in Niger, they have led to three or fourfold increases in millet yields.</li>
<li>Falling back from crops to wild edible fruits, roots and leaves. Promoting the growth of forests can provide these backup food supplies, and also provide watershed conservation, carbon sequestration, and aesthetic value.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="More_spending_on_irrigation">More spending on irrigation</span></h4>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Demand_for_water" title="Demand for water">demand for water</a> for <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> is projected to rise in a warmer climate, bringing increased competition between agriculture—already the largest consumer of water resources in <a href="/wiki/Semi-arid_climate" title="Semi-arid climate">semi-arid regions</a>—and urban as well as industrial users. Falling <a href="/wiki/Water_table" title="Water table">water tables</a> and the resulting increase in the energy needed to pump water will make the practice of irrigation more expensive, particularly when with drier conditions more water will be required per <a href="/wiki/Acre" title="Acre">acre</a>. Other strategies will be needed to make the most efficient use of water resources. For example, the <a href="/wiki/International_Water_Management_Institute" title="International Water Management Institute">International Water Management Institute</a> has suggested five strategies that could help Asia feed its growing population in light of climate change. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernising existing irrigation schemes to suit modern methods of farming</li>
<li>Supporting farmers' efforts to find their own water supplies, by tapping into groundwater in a sustainable way</li>
<li>Looking beyond conventional "Participatory Irrigation Management" schemes, by engaging the private sector</li>
<li>Expanding capacity and knowledge</li>
<li>Investing outside the irrigation sector</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weather_control">Weather control</span></h3>
<p>Russian and American scientists have in the past tried to control the weather, for example by <a href="/wiki/Cloud_seeding" title="Cloud seeding">seeding clouds</a> with chemicals to try to produce rain when and where it is needed. A new method being developed involves replicating the <a href="/wiki/Urban_heat_island" title="Urban heat island">urban heat island</a> effect, where cities are slightly hotter than the countryside because they are darker and absorb more heat. This creates 28% more rain 20–40 miles <a href="/wiki/Windward_and_leeward#mediaviewer.2FFile:Upwind_downwind_example.png" title="Windward and leeward">downwind</a> from cities compared to upwind. On the timescale of several decades, new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weather_control" title="Weather control">weather control</a> techniques may become feasible which would allow control of extreme weather such as hurricanes.</p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WMO" title="WMO">WMO</a>) through its Commission for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) opined in 2007: "Purposeful augmentation of precipitation, reduction of hail damage, dispersion of fog and other types of cloud and storm modifications by cloud seeding are developing technologies which are still striving to achieve a sound scientific foundation and which have to be adapted to enormously varied natural conditions."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Damming_glacial_lakes">Damming glacial lakes</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Glacial_lake_outburst_flood" title="Glacial lake outburst flood">Glacial lake outburst floods</a> may become a bigger concern due to the retreat of glaciers, leaving behind numerous lakes that are impounded by often weak <a href="/wiki/Terminal_moraine" title="Terminal moraine">terminal moraine</a> dams. In the past, the sudden failure of these dams has resulted in localized property damage, injury and deaths. <a href="/wiki/Glacial_lake" title="Glacial lake">Glacial lakes</a> in danger of bursting can have their <a href="/wiki/Moraine" title="Moraine">moraines</a> replaced with concrete dams (which may also provide hydroelectric power).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Geoengineering">Geoengineering</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">Climate engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solar_radiation_management" title="Solar radiation management">Solar radiation management</a></div>
<p>IPCC (2007) concluded that <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">geoengineering</a> options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, remained largely unproven. It was judged that reliable cost estimates for geoengineering had not been published.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> (2009) published the findings of a study into geoengineering. The authors of the study defined geoengineering as a "deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, in order to moderate global warming" (p. ix). According to the study, the safest and most predictable method of moderating climate change is early action to reduce GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Scientists such as <a href="/wiki/Ken_Caldeira" title="Ken Caldeira">Ken Caldeira</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paul_Crutzen" title="Paul Crutzen">Paul Crutzen</a> suggest techniques such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Solar_radiation_management" title="Solar radiation management">Solar radiation management</a> may be seen as an adaptation to global warming. Techniques such as <a href="/wiki/Space_sunshade" title="Space sunshade">space sunshade</a>, creating <a href="/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfur_aerosols" title="Stratospheric sulfur aerosols">stratospheric sulfur aerosols</a> and painting roofing and paving materials white all fall into this category.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrological_geoengineering" title="Hydrological geoengineering">Hydrological geoengineering</a> - typically seeking to preserve <a href="/wiki/Sea_ice" title="Sea ice">sea ice</a> or adjust <a href="/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" title="Thermohaline circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> by using methods such as diverting rivers to keep warm water away from <a href="/wiki/Sea_ice" title="Sea ice">sea ice</a>, or tethering <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Icebergs" title="Icebergs">icebergs</a> to prevent them drifting into warmer waters and melting. Though this is an adaptation technique, if it prevents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arctic_methane_release" title="Arctic methane release">Arctic methane release</a> it would also be classified as mitigation.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>
<p>Migration frequently requires would-be migrants to have access to social and financial capital, such as support networks in the chosen destination, and the funds or physical resources to be able to move. It is frequently the last adaptive response households will take when confronted with environmental factors that threaten their livelihoods, and mostly resorted to when other mechanisms to cope have proven unsuccessful.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Insurance">Insurance</span></h3>
<p>Insurance spreads the financial impact of flooding and other extreme weather events. Although it can be preferable to take a proactive approach to eliminate the cause of the risk, reactive post-harm compensation can be used as a last resort. Access to reinsurance may be a form of increasing the resiliency of cities. Where there are failures in the private insurance market, the public sector can subsidize premiums. A study identified key equity issues for policy considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>transferring risk to the public purse does not reduce overall risk</li>
<li>governments can spread the cost of losses across time rather than space</li>
<li>governments can force home-owners in low risk areas to cross-subsidize the insurance premiums of those in high risk areas</li>
<li>cross-subsidization is increasingly difficult for private sector insurers operating in a competitive market</li>
<li>governments can tax people to pay for tomorrow’s disaster</li>
</ul>
<p>Government-subsidized insurance, such as the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, is criticized for providing a <a href="/wiki/Perverse_incentive" title="Perverse incentive">perverse incentive</a> to develop properties in hazardous areas, thereby increasing overall risk. It is also suggested that insurance can undermine other efforts to increase adaptation, for instance through property level protection and resilience. This behavioral effect may be countered with appropriate land-use policies that limit new construction where current or future climate risks are perceived and/or encourage the adoption of resilient building codes to mitigate potential damages.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adaptation_measures_by_country">Adaptation measures by country</span></h2>
<p>Numerous countries, including <a href="/wiki/Adaptation_to_global_warming_in_Australia" title="Adaptation to global warming in Australia">Australia</a>, have held inquiries into and have planned or started adaptation measures.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<p>The state of <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> has also issued a document titled "2009 California Climate Adaptation Strategy Discussion Draft" that summarizes the best known science on climate change impacts in seven specific sectors and provides recommendations on how to manage against those threats. Within the state of <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> four counties (<a href="/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida" title="Broward County, Florida">Broward</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami-Dade" title="Miami-Dade">Miami-Dade</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monroe_County,_Florida" title="Monroe County, Florida">Monroe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida" title="Palm Beach County, Florida">Palm Beach</a>) have created the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact in order to coordinate adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the impact of climate change on the region. Poorer communities have gotten help with climate adaptation in places like Bangladesh as well. The Commonwealth of <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> has issued grants to coastal cities and towns for adaptation activities such as fortification against flooding and preventing coastal erosion. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_(state)" title="New York (state)">New York</a> State is requiring climate change be taken into account in certain infrastructure permitting, zoning, and open space programs; and is mapping sea level rise along its coast. After <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy" title="Hurricane Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, New York and New Jersey accelerated voluntary government buy-back of homes in flood-prone areas. New York City announced in 2013 it planned to spend between $10 and $20 billion on local flood protection, reduction of the heat island effect with reflective and green roofs, flood-hardening of hospitals and public housing, resiliency in food supply, and beach enhancement; rezoned to allow private property owners to move critical features to upper stories; and required electrical utilities to harden infrastructure against flooding. A large storm barrier spanning the entire harbor was previously proposed, but was not included in government plans.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Opposition_to_adaptation">Opposition to adaptation</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>, writing in 1992 in <i><a href="/wiki/Earth_in_the_Balance" title="Earth in the Balance">Earth in the Balance</a></i>, adaptation represented a "kind of laziness, an arrogant faith in our ability to react in time to save our skins".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate_adaptation_denial">Climate adaptation denial</span></h3>
<p>According to a <a href="/wiki/Report" title="Report">report</a> released by Greenpeace USA in September 2013, climate change denial and the campaigns designed to block adaptation measures grew mainly out of the 1990s negotiations slated to develop a global agreement. During these talks, a number of lobby groups were established with an objective of developing doubt within policymakers and the media through the use of publications in the guise of true science. This tactic, similar to those of large tobacco companies, was utilized by the lobby groups in the hopes of delaying action and blurring the lines between the valid scientific efforts to challenge climate change findings and those designed to merely undermine the credibility of the scientific community. This strategy feeds into the “uncertainty argument” and develops an impression of debate through references to the uncertainty of scientific findings that exist in any research model. Additional tactics that the lobbyist groups have used include releasing non-stories manufactured from stolen emails and communications plans to develop more media coverage of the uncertainty argument.</p>
