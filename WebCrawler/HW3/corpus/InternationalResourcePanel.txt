<p>The <b>International Resource Panel</b> is a scientific panel of experts that aims to help nations use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_resources" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a> sustainably without compromising <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic" title="Economic">economic</a> growth and human needs. It provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the volume of selected <a href="/wiki/Raw_material" title="Raw material">raw material</a> reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used</li>
<li>the lifecycle-long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe</li>
<li>options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Secretariat of the IRP is hosted by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) through its office in Paris, France.</p>

<p>Supported by a small Secretariat, the International Resource Panel comprises 30 expert members drawn from a wide range of academic institutions and scientific organisations (see table below). It is co-chaired by <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Ulrich_von_Weizs%C3%A4cker" title="Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker">Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker</a>, former Chairman of the Bundestag Environment Committee, and Ashok Khosla, President of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for the Conservation of Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), and founder of the Indian non-profit organisation Development Alternatives. Its Steering Committee includes over 20 governments as well as the EC, OECD, UNEP and civil society organisations including the IUCN, <a href="/wiki/World_Business_Council_for_Sustainable_Development" title="World Business Council for Sustainable Development">World Business Council for Sustainable Development</a> (WBCSD) and <a href="/wiki/International_Council_for_Science" title="International Council for Science">International Council for Science</a> (ICSU).</p>

<p>While <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> loss have emerged as the world’s most pressing environmental issue in recent decades, both issues are increasingly being seen as symptomatic of a broader problem of overuse of resources and lack of attention to the impacts on the environment they cause. The resources in question include materials (fossil fuels, biomass, construction minerals and metals), water, land and energy.</p>
<p>The 2005 <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Ecosystem_Assessment" title="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a> found that rapid rises in human demands for natural resources have caused substantial and irreversible loss of biodiversity Our current rate of consumption of resources such as fossil fuels, metals, <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a> and timber, is unsustainable and inequitable. <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">WWF</a> has pointed out that if we continue to consume resources at current levels, by 2050 we will need two planet’s worth of natural materials to support the human race.</p>
<p>The concept of sustainable use of resources was placed on the global governance agenda in 1992 at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Environment_and_Development" title="United Nations Conference on Environment and Development">United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</a> or ‘Earth Summit’ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. By 2005, several leading international environmental organisations were undertaking disparate work related to natural resources. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> was investigating sustainable materials management, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> put forward a new Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources used in Europe and UNEP was conducting detailed studies into the way we use resources and their impacts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="A_need_for_science">A need for science</span></h3>
<p>As various authorities began shaping policies to encourage sustainable consumption and production, two issues emerged. One was that the field was lacking the kind of rigorous scientific assessments that underpinned research into other environmental disciplines, such as <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> (<a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>), biodiversity (<a href="/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="Convention on Biological Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a>) and Ozone (<a href="/wiki/Montreal_Protocol" title="Montreal Protocol">Montreal Protocol</a>). The other was that as raw materials are sourced, processed, manufactured into products, traded and consumed in locations around the world, any scientific assessments would need to be global in scope. Different regions also tended to treat the topic differently, depending on the volume of resources they used, methods they used to process resources and whether they had access to domestic resources or depended on imports.</p>

<p>The IRP was founded in 2007 as a way to address this void and support diverse efforts being made to shift the world towards sustainable consumption and production. By mid-2011, the IRP had released in-depth assessments on <a href="/wiki/Decoupling_(utility_regulation)" title="Decoupling (utility regulation)">decoupling</a> (the concept of separating economic growth from environmental degradation), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels" title="Biofuels">biofuels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a> stocks, plus priority products and materials.</p>
<p>The IRP will publish a further ten assessments over the next 18 months. These will cover topics such as <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> mitigation technologies, efficiency of water use, trade, plus land and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soils" title="Soils">soils</a>.</p>
<p>By providing the best available scientific information on using resources efficiently, the IRP aims to help the world shift to a ‘<a href="/wiki/Green_economy" title="Green economy">green economy</a>’, where patterns of consumption and production are sustainable, all citizens have equitable access to resources and the enduring quality of the <a href="/wiki/Global_commons" title="Global commons">global commons</a> is assured.</p>
