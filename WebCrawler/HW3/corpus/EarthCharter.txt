<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p>The <b>Earth Charter</b> is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter "seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations." It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that <a href="/wiki/Environmental_protection" title="Environmental protection">environmental protection</a>, <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, equitable <a href="/wiki/Human_development_(humanity)" title="Human development (humanity)">human development</a>, and <a href="/wiki/World_peace" title="World peace">peace</a> are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The <a href="/wiki/Earth_Charter_Initiative" title="Earth Charter Initiative">Earth Charter Initiative</a> organization exists to promote the Charter.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Strong" title="Maurice Strong">Maurice Strong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> as members of The Club of Rome, when the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Commission_on_Environment_and_Development" title="World Commission on Environment and Development">World Commission on Environment and Development</a> called for a new charter to guide the transition to <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secretary_General_of_the_United_Nations" title="Secretary General of the United Nations">Secretary General</a> <a href="/wiki/Boutros_Boutros-Ghali" title="Boutros Boutros-Ghali">Boutros Boutros-Ghali</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a>, but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rio_Declaration" title="Rio Declaration">Rio Declaration</a> became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Strong" title="Maurice Strong">Maurice Strong</a> (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, working through organizations they each founded (the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Earth_Council&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Earth Council (page does not exist)">Earth Council</a> and <a href="/wiki/Green_Cross_International" title="Green Cross International">Green Cross International</a> respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" title="Civil society">civil society</a> initiative, with the help of the government of the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Drafting">Drafting</span></h2>
<p>The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.</p>
<p>One of the principle creators of the Earth Charter was <a href="/wiki/Steven_Clark_Rockefeller" title="Steven Clark Rockefeller">Steven Clark Rockefeller</a>, who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at Middlebury College and an advisory trustee of the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_Brothers_Fund" title="Rockefeller Brothers Fund">Rockefeller Brothers Fund</a>. According to text with a <a class="external text" href="http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm" rel="nofollow">2001 interview with Rockefeller</a>, he "chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee. He is also a member of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee..."</p>
<p>The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The <a href="/wiki/Peace_Palace" title="Peace Palace">Peace Palace</a> in <a href="/wiki/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, Netherlands. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Queen_Beatrix" title="Queen Beatrix">Queen Beatrix</a> of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.</p>

ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity's shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.</p>
