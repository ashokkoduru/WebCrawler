<p>Sustainability can also be defined as a socio-ecological process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal. An ideal is by definition unattainable in a given time/space but endlessly approachable and it is this endless pursuit that forms a sustainable system in the process (ibid).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">Sustainable development</a></div>
<p>The name sustainability is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>sustinere</i> (<i>tenere</i>, to hold; <i>sub</i>, up). <i>Sustain</i> can mean “maintain", "support", or "endure”. Since the 1980s <i>sustainability</i> has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept <i><a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a></i>, that of the <a href="/wiki/Brundtland_Commission" title="Brundtland Commission">Brundtland Commission</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> on March 20, 1987: “sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Three_pillars_of_sustainability">Three pillars of sustainability</span></h3>


<p>The <a href="/wiki/2005_World_Summit" title="2005 World Summit">2005 World Summit on Social Development</a> identified sustainable development goals, such as economic development, social development and environmental protection. This view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing. In fact, the three pillars are interdependent, and in the long run none can exist without the others. The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous <a href="/wiki/Sustainability_standards_and_certification" title="Sustainability standards and certification">sustainability standards and certification</a> systems in recent years, in particular in the food industry. Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include <a href="/wiki/Rainforest_Alliance" title="Rainforest Alliance">Rainforest Alliance</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairtrade" title="Fairtrade">Fairtrade</a> and <a href="/wiki/UTZ_Certified" title="UTZ Certified">UTZ Certified</a>. Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability, or a quadruple bottom line. One such pillar is future generations, which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability. There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability.</p>
<p>Sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment. The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment.</p>
<p>A study from 2005 pointed out that <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environmental justice</a> is as important as is sustainable development. Ecological economist <a href="/wiki/Herman_Daly" title="Herman Daly">Herman Daly</a> asked, "what use is a sawmill without a forest?" From this perspective, the economy is a subsystem of human society, which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere, and a gain in one sector is a loss from another. This perspective led to the nested circles figure of 'economics' inside 'society' inside the 'environment'.</p>
<p>The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves "the <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_life" title="Quality of life">quality of human life</a> while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits. But sustainability is also a call to action, a task in progress or “journey” and therefore a political process, so some definitions set out common goals and values. The <a href="/wiki/Earth_Charter" title="Earth Charter">Earth Charter</a> speaks of “a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace.” This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability, which included the importance of the domain of 'politics'.</p>
<p>More than that, sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience, economic prosperity, political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future. Specific types of sustainability include, <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture" title="Sustainable agriculture">sustainable agriculture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_architecture" title="Sustainable architecture">sustainable architecture</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">ecological economics</a>. Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like "liberty" or "justice". It has also been described as a "dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Circles_of_sustainability">Circles of sustainability</span></h3>

<p>While the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Millennium_Declaration" title="United Nations Millennium Declaration">United Nations Millennium Declaration</a> identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, <a href="/wiki/Social_sustainability" title="Social sustainability">social development</a> and environmental protection it continued using three domains: economics, environment and social sustainability. More recently, using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade, the <a href="/wiki/Circles_of_Sustainability" title="Circles of Sustainability">Circles of Sustainability</a> approach distinguished four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability. This in accord with the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="/wiki/Agenda_21" title="Agenda 21">Agenda 21</a>, which specifies <b>culture</b> as the fourth domain of sustainable development. The model is now being used by organizations such as the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Global_Compact" title="United Nations Global Compact">United Nations</a> Cities Programme. and Metropolis</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shaping_the_future">Shaping the future</span></h3>
<p>Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the <a href="/wiki/European_environmental_research_and_innovation_policy" title="European environmental research and innovation policy">European environmental research and innovation policy</a>. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Horizon_2020" title="Horizon 2020">Horizon 2020</a>, which is also open to participation worldwide. Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Resiliency">Resiliency</span></h2>
<p><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/resilience" title="wikt:resilience">Resiliency</a> in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability. Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Policymaker" title="Policymaker">policymakers</a> a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the services current and future generations need from them. It is also concerned with commitment from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geopolitical" title="Geopolitical">geopolitical</a> policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life? The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at <a href="/wiki/Juncture" title="Juncture">junctures</a> or events where the combination of <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">naturally</a> occurring <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regenerative_(design)" title="Regenerative (design)">regenerative</a> forces (<a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a>, water, soil, <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, vegetation, and <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.</p>
<p>A practical view of sustainability is <a href="/wiki/Closed_system" title="Closed system">closed systems</a> that maintain processes of <a href="/wiki/Productivity" title="Productivity">productivity</a> indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems. In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of <a href="/wiki/Adaptation" title="Adaptation">adaptation</a> as an ecosystem returns to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/viability" title="wikt:viability">viability</a> from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by <a href="/wiki/Dissipation" title="Dissipation">absorption</a>, <a href="/wiki/Utilization" title="Utilization">utilization</a>, or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rejection" title="wikt:rejection">deflection</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> or energies that the external forces created.</p>
<p>In analysing systems such as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_sustainability" title="History of sustainability">History of sustainability</a></div>
<p>The history of sustainability traces human-dominated <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> systems from the earliest <a href="/wiki/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> to the present time. This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>, followed by crises that were either resolved, producing sustainability, or not, leading to decline.</p>
<p>In early human history, the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agrarian_community" title="Agrarian community">agrarian communities</a> emerged which depended largely on their <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">environment</a> and the creation of a "structure of permanence."</p>
<p>The Western <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> of the 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>. <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">Coal</a> was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a> pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale. The 1973 and 1979 <a href="/wiki/Energy_crisis" title="Energy crisis">energy crises</a> demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a>, produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_and_concepts">Principles and concepts</span></h2>
<p>The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; in recent years an area that has come to be called <a href="/wiki/Sustainability_science" title="Sustainability science">sustainability science</a> has emerged.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Millennium_Declaration" title="United Nations Millennium Declaration">United Nations Millennium Declaration</a> identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, <a href="/wiki/Social_sustainability" title="Social sustainability">social development</a> and environmental protection.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scale_and_context">Scale and context</span></h3>
<p>Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. The focus ranges from the total <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on. In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it. As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist, has stated: "We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space."</p>
<p>The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner <a href="/wiki/Jason_Lewis_(adventurer)" title="Jason Lewis (adventurer)">Jason Lewis</a> has drawn parallels to other, more tangible <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Closed_systems" title="Closed systems">closed systems</a>. For example, he likens human existence on Earth — isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Accelerated_depletion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Accelerated depletion (page does not exist)">accelerated depletion</a> of resources — to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the <a href="/wiki/Precautionary_principle" title="Precautionary principle">precautionary principle</a> is a key factor in survival.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumption">Consumption</span></h3>
<p>A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biophysical" title="Biophysical">biophysical</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Resources" title="Resources">resources</a>, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.</p>
<p>One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/I_PAT" title="I PAT">I PAT</a> formula. This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components: <a href="/wiki/Population" title="Population">population</a> numbers, levels of consumption (which it terms "affluence", although the usage is different), and impact per unit of resource use (which is termed "technology", because this impact depends on the <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> used). The equation is expressed:</p>

<p>Sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include <a href="/wiki/Ecological_indicator" title="Ecological indicator">indicators</a>, benchmarks, audits, <a href="/wiki/Sustainability_standards_and_certification" title="Sustainability standards and certification">sustainability standards and certification</a> systems like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairtrade" title="Fairtrade">Fairtrade</a> and <a href="/wiki/Organic_certification" title="Organic certification">Organic</a>, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.</p>
<p>Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate <a href="/wiki/Sustainability_reporting" title="Sustainability reporting">sustainability reporting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Triple_bottom_line" title="Triple bottom line">Triple Bottom Line accounting</a>, World Sustainability Society, <a href="/wiki/Circles_of_Sustainability" title="Circles of Sustainability">Circles of Sustainability</a>, and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_Sustainability_Index" title="Environmental Sustainability Index">Environmental Sustainability Index</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_Performance_Index" title="Environmental Performance Index">Environmental Performance Index</a>.</p>

<p>According to the 2008 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world population</a> is projected to reach 7 billion early in 2012, up from the current 6.9 billion (May 2009), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050. Most of the increase will be in <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing countries</a> whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed regions</a> is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.</p>
<p>Emerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world as does the non-industrialized world in general. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carrying_capacity">Carrying capacity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">Carrying capacity</a></div>

<p>At the global scale, scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely. This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Ecosystem_Assessment" title="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Planetary_boundaries" title="Planetary boundaries">planetary boundaries</a> framework. An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the 1972 book <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Limits_to_Growth" title="Limits to Growth">Limits to Growth</a></i>, which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis. A 2012 review in <i>Nature</i> by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be "approaching a state shift" in its biosphere.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ecological_footprint" title="Ecological footprint">Ecological footprint</a> measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 <a href="/wiki/Global_hectare" title="Global hectare">global hectares</a> per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms). The resulting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecological_deficit" title="Ecological deficit">ecological deficit</a> must be met from unsustainable <i>extra</i> sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by <a href="/wiki/Overexploitation" title="Overexploitation">over exploiting</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forests#Forest_management_and_forest_loss" title="Forests">forests</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fisheries_management" title="Fisheries management">fisheries</a>).</p>
<p>The figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN <a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a> (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a> has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use. The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed "one planet" consumption. Information generated by reports at the national, regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals" title="Sustainable Development Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) are the current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targets.</p>
<p>The Official Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on 25 September 2015 has 92 paragraphs, with the main paragraph (51) outlining the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and its associated 169 targets. This included the following seventeen goals:</p>

</ol>
<p>As of August 2015, there were 169 proposed targets for these goals and 304 proposed indicators to show compliance.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals" title="Sustainable Development Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) replace the eight <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs), which expired at the end of 2015.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainable_development">Sustainable development</span></h3>
<p>According to the data that member countries represented to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> was the only nation in the world in 2006 that met the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a>'s definition of <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>, with an <a href="/wiki/Ecological_footprint" title="Ecological footprint">ecological footprint</a> of less than 1.8 hectares per capita, 1.5, and a <a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a> of over 0.8, 0.855.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_dimension">Environmental dimension</span></h2>
<p>Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> and the first of these is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_management" title="Environmental management">environmental management</a>. This direct approach is based largely on information gained from <a href="/wiki/Earth_science" title="Earth science">earth science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environmental science</a> and <a href="/wiki/Conservation_biology" title="Conservation biology">conservation biology</a>. However, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">consumption</a>, so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.</p>
<p>Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_yield" title="Sustainable yield">sustainable yield</a> (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sustainability_and_environmental_management" title="Sustainability and environmental management">Sustainability and environmental management</a></div>
<p>At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater">freshwater</a> systems, land and <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Atmosphere">Atmosphere</span></h4>
<p>At a March 2009 meeting of the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Climate_Council" title="Copenhagen Climate Council">Copenhagen Climate Council</a>, 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with". Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_cycle" title="Carbon cycle">carbon cycle</a> to identify opportunities to address human-induced <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities (see <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">Energy</a> below).</p>
<p>Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> in cities, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pollutants" title="Pollutants">pollutants</a> including toxic chemicals like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides" title="Nitrogen oxides">nitrogen oxides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur oxides</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compounds" title="Volatile organic compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_particulate_matter" title="Atmospheric particulate matter">airborne particulate matter</a> that produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photochemical_smog" title="Photochemical smog">photochemical smog</a> and <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbons</a> that degrade the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>. <a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">Anthropogenic</a> particulates such as sulfate <a href="/wiki/Aerosol" title="Aerosol">aerosols</a> in the atmosphere reduce the direct <a href="/wiki/Irradiance" title="Irradiance">irradiance</a> and reflectance (<a href="/wiki/Albedo" title="Albedo">albedo</a>) of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface. Known as <a href="/wiki/Global_dimming" title="Global dimming">global dimming</a>, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global <a href="/wiki/Water_cycle" title="Water cycle">water cycle</a> by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a> on <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Freshwater_and_oceans">Freshwater and oceans</span></h4>
<p>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a> and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the <a href="/wiki/Antarctic_ice_sheet" title="Antarctic ice sheet">Antarctic ice sheet</a>. The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world’s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wetlands" title="Wetlands">wetlands</a> have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing <a href="/wiki/Urbanization" title="Urbanization">urbanization</a> pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">Ocean</a> circulation patterns have a strong influence on <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a> and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, under the influence of climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of <a href="/wiki/Ocean_current" title="Ocean current">ocean currents</a> that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population – about 600 million people – live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Land_use">Land use</span></h4>

<p>Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as <a href="/wiki/Natural_capital" title="Natural capital">natural capital</a> is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urbanisation" title="Urbanisation">urbanisation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grassland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pasture" title="Pasture">pasture</a> have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_gardening" title="Sustainable gardening">sustainable parks and gardens</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_cities" title="Green cities">green cities</a>.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> about 47% of the world’s forests have been lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> in the tropics is of major concern.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">Food</a> is essential to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a> to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now a major part of global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_agriculture" title="Industrial agriculture">industrial agriculture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Agribusiness" title="Agribusiness">agribusiness</a> are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a> and more sustainable business practices.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Management_of_human_consumption">Management of human consumption</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">Consumption (economics)</a></div>

<p>The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), <a href="/wiki/Resource_intensity" title="Resource intensity">resource intensity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Resource_productivity" title="Resource productivity">resource productivity</a> are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a>, <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a>, materials and water.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="/wiki/International_Resource_Panel" title="International Resource Panel">International Resource Panel</a>, hosted by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP), published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> health, human health and <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource depletion</a>. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fisheries" title="Fisheries">fisheries</a> have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">consumption</a> perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a> and energy-using products cause the majority of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment" title="Life cycle assessment">life-cycle</a> impacts of consumption.</p>

<p>The Sun's energy, stored by plants (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primary_producer" title="Primary producer">primary producers</a>) during <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, passes through the <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chain</a> to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> the concentrated energy of the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> stored in fossilized plants as <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> has been a major driver of <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">IPCC</a> concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO<sub>2</sub> was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world’s climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO<sub>2</sub> levels at 450–650 ppm from current levels of about 380 ppm. Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2 °C to produce “catastrophic” <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. Reduction of current CO<sub>2</sub> levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy-intensive high consumption Western lifestyles.</p>
<p>Reducing greenhouse emissions, is being tackled at all scales, ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_cycle" title="Carbon cycle">carbon cycle</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization" title="Renewable energy commercialization">commercialization of renewable energy</a>, developing less carbon-hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_neutral" title="Carbon neutral">carbon neutral</a> lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use. <a href="/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">Engineering</a> of <a href="/wiki/Emerging_technologies" title="Emerging technologies">emerging technologies</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel" title="Carbon-neutral fuel">carbon-neutral fuel</a> and energy storage systems such as <a href="/wiki/Power_to_gas" title="Power to gas">power to gas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage" title="Compressed air energy storage">compressed air energy storage</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage hydroelectricity</a> are necessary to store power from transient <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources including emerging renewables such as <a href="/wiki/Airborne_wind_turbine" title="Airborne wind turbine">airborne wind turbines</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Water_security" title="Water security">Water security</a> and <a href="/wiki/Food_security" title="Food security">food security</a> are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the <a href="/wiki/Economy" title="Economy">economy</a> – especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive <a href="/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">dam</a> construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">rivers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lake" title="Lake">lakes</a>, affected their <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">water quality</a> and had a significant impact on the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> impacts become more severe, <a href="/wiki/Population" title="Population">populations</a> increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled — agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a>, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.</p>
<p>Water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased <a href="/wiki/Demand_management" title="Demand management">demand management</a>, improved infrastructure, improved water <a href="/wiki/Resource_productivity" title="Resource productivity">productivity</a> of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Public_Health_Association" title="American Public Health Association">American Public Health Association</a> (APHA) defines a "sustainable food system" as "one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment. A sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available, accessible, and affordable to all. Further, it is humane and just, protecting farmers and other workers, consumers, and communities." Concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">obesity</a> problems of the Western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy, sustainable eating as a major component of overall <a href="/wiki/Ethical_consumerism" title="Ethical consumerism">ethical consumerism</a>. The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors, including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production. The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> has published a <i>Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health</i> report which was endorsed by the May 2004 <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Assembly" title="World Health Assembly">World Health Assembly</a>. It recommends the Mediterranean diet which is associated with health and <a href="/wiki/Longevity" title="Longevity">longevity</a> and is low in <a href="/wiki/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a>, rich in <a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, low in added sugar and limited salt, and low in <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fatty</a> acids; the traditional source of <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a> in the Mediterranean is <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a>, rich in <a href="/wiki/Monounsaturated_fat" title="Monounsaturated fat">monounsaturated fat</a>. The healthy rice-based Japanese diet is also high in <a href="/wiki/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a> and low in fat. Both diets are low in meat and <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fats</a> and high in <a href="/wiki/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a> and other vegetables; they are associated with a low incidence of ailments and low environmental impact.</p>
<p>At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and <a href="/wiki/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic farming</a>. At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production, more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including <a href="/wiki/Permaculture" title="Permaculture">permaculture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urban_horticulture" title="Urban horticulture">urban horticulture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Local_food" title="Local food">local food</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slow_food" title="Slow food">slow food</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_gardening" title="Sustainable gardening">sustainable gardening</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_gardening" title="Organic gardening">organic gardening</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sustainable_seafood" title="Sustainable seafood">Sustainable seafood</a> is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both <a href="/wiki/Overfishing" title="Overfishing">overfishing</a> and environmentally destructive fishing methods.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Materials.2C_toxic_substances.2C_waste">Materials, toxic substances, waste</span></h4>

<p>As global population and affluence has increased, so has the use of various materials increased in volume, diversity and distance transported. Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hazardous_substances" title="Hazardous substances">hazardous substances</a>), manufactured products, food, living organisms and waste. By 2050, humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year (three times its current amount) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita, ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable.</p>
<p>Sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of <a href="/wiki/Dematerialization_(economics)" title="Dematerialization (economics)">dematerialization</a>, converting the linear path of materials (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a <a href="/wiki/Material_flow_accounting" title="Material flow accounting">circular material flow</a> that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by <a href="/wiki/Product_stewardship" title="Product stewardship">product stewardship</a> and the increasing use of <a href="/wiki/Material_flow_analysis" title="Material flow analysis">material flow analysis</a> at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.</p>

<p>On one account, sustainability "concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption, wealth, utility, or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons." Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics represents: "... a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective. Social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis." However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins. At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_damage" title="Environmental damage">environmental damage</a> and resource depletion.</p>
<p>A recent UNEP report proposes a <a href="/wiki/Green_economy" title="Green economy">green economy</a> defined as one that “improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities”: it "does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of <a href="/wiki/Natural_capital" title="Natural capital">natural capital</a>". The report makes three key findings: “that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital, but also (over a period of six years) produces a higher rate of GDP growth”; that there is “an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor”; "in the transition to a green economy, new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in “brown economy” jobs. However, there is a period of job losses in transition, which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce”.</p>
<p>Several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externality</a>; and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.</p>

<p>Historically there has been a close correlation between <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_degradation" title="Environmental degradation">environmental degradation</a>: as communities grow, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators. Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer because it eats away at the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> which are its life-support system. There is concern that, unless resource use is checked, modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through <a href="/wiki/Overexploitation" title="Overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of their resource base. While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources, ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale (rather than continual growth), <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_distribution" title="Sustainable distribution">fair distribution</a> and efficient allocation, in that order. The <a href="/wiki/World_Business_Council_for_Sustainable_Development" title="World Business Council for Sustainable Development">World Business Council for Sustainable Development</a> states that "business cannot succeed in societies that fail".</p>
<p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic" title="Economic">economic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_policy" title="Environmental policy">environmental</a> fields, the term <a href="/wiki/Decoupling_(utility_regulation)" title="Decoupling (utility regulation)">decoupling</a> is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to <a href="/wiki/Environmental_quality" title="Environmental quality">environmental quality</a>. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the <a href="/wiki/International_Resource_Panel" title="International Resource Panel">International Resource Panel</a>, hosted by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times its current rate of consumption – unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce <a href="/wiki/Resource_intensity" title="Resource intensity">resource intensity</a> (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.</p>
<p>There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GDP" title="GDP">GDP</a>) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the <a href="/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)" title="Rebound effect (conservation)">rebound effect (conservation)</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jevons_Paradox" title="Jevons Paradox">Jevons Paradox</a> resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="Second law of thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Steady_state_economy" title="Steady state economy">steady state economy</a> in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by <a href="/wiki/Herman_Daly" title="Herman Daly">Herman Daly</a> and others in the <a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">ecological economics</a> community.</p>
<p>A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the <i>restore</i> approach. This approach views "restore" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nature_as_an_economic_externality">Nature as an economic externality</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">Ecosystem services</a></div>
<p>The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a <a href="/wiki/Commodity" title="Commodity">commodity</a> or service becomes more scarce the <a href="/wiki/Price" title="Price">price</a> increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Externalities" title="Externalities">externalities</a> they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons" title="Tragedy of the Commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>.</p>
<p>One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to "internalize" these "externalities" by using market strategies like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecotaxes" title="Ecotaxes">ecotaxes</a> and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of <a href="/wiki/Payment_for_ecosystem_services" title="Payment for ecosystem services">payment for ecosystem services</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Community_currencies" title="Community currencies">Community currencies</a> associated with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Local_Exchange_Trading_Systems" title="Local Exchange Trading Systems">Local Exchange Trading Systems</a> (LETS), a <a href="/wiki/Gift_economy" title="Gift economy">gift economy</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Time_Banking" title="Time Banking">Time Banking</a> have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_economics" title="Green economics">Green economics</a> is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment. The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_opportunity">Economic opportunity</span></h3>
<p>Treating the environment as an externality may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability. <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_business" title="Sustainable business">Sustainable business</a> practices, on the other hand, integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones (i.e., the <a href="/wiki/Triple_bottom_line" title="Triple bottom line">triple bottom line</a>). Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed "<a href="/wiki/Uneconomic_growth" title="Uneconomic growth">uneconomic growth</a>" as it leads to a decline in <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_life" title="Quality of life">quality of life</a>. Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses. For example, industrial waste can be treated as an "economic resource in the wrong place". The benefits of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waste_reduction" title="Waste reduction">waste reduction</a> include savings from disposal costs, fewer environmental penalties, and reduced liability insurance. This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image. Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs.</p>
<p>The idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the <a href="/wiki/Society_for_Organizational_Learning" title="Society for Organizational Learning">Society for Organizational Learning</a>, the Sustainable Business Institute, and the World Council for Sustainable Development. The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Job_creation" title="Job creation">job creation</a> through the introduction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green-collar" title="Green-collar">green-collar</a> workers. Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of "embedded sustainability" – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and <a href="/wiki/Nadya_Zhexembayeva" title="Nadya Zhexembayeva">Nadya Zhexembayeva</a> as "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality – in other words, with no social or green premium." Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation. <a href="/wiki/Nadya_Zhexembayeva" title="Nadya Zhexembayeva">Nadya Zhexembayeva</a>'s 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services, as well as the company strategy as a whole, when right principles of innovation are applied.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Eco-socialism" title="Eco-socialism">Eco-socialism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a></div>
<p>One school of thought, often labeled <a href="/wiki/Eco-socialism" title="Eco-socialism">ecosocialism</a> or ecological Marxism, asserts that the <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist economic system</a> is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability. This theory rests on the premises that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capitalism’s sole economic purpose is “unlimited <a href="/wiki/Capital_accumulation" title="Capital accumulation">capital accumulation</a>” in the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">capitalist class</a></li>
<li>The urge to accumulate (the <a href="/wiki/Profit_motive" title="Profit motive">profit motive</a>) drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production, creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth</li>
<li>“Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production” (the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, according to this analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human needs</a> while staying within ecological limits, as <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> demands, is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism</li>
<li>A steady-state capitalist economy is impossible; further, a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive <a href="/wiki/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">unemployment and underemployment</a></li>
<li>Capitalism will, unless overcome by <a href="/wiki/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and <a href="/wiki/Societal_collapse" title="Societal collapse">self-destruct</a></li>
</ol>
<p>By this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises (<a href="/wiki/Ecological_economics" title="Ecological economics">ecological economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environmental_economics" title="Environmental economics">environmental economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Green_economy" title="Green economy">green economy</a>) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism’s structural failures. “Low-risk” technology/science-based solutions such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture" title="Sustainable agriculture">sustainable agriculture</a>, and increases in <a href="/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency" title="Energy conversion efficiency">energy efficiency</a> are seen as necessary but insufficient. “High-risk” technological solutions such as <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a> are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to “<a href="/wiki/Greenwashing" title="Greenwashing">greenwash</a>” their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as <a href="/wiki/Walmart" title="Walmart">Walmart</a>’s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has <a href="/wiki/Jevons_paradox" title="Jevons paradox">the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption</a>, viz. further economic growth. <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_business" title="Sustainable business">Sustainable business</a> models and the <a href="/wiki/Triple_bottom_line" title="Triple bottom line">triple bottom line</a> are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the <a href="/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth" title="Distribution of wealth">distribution of wealth</a> to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders <a href="/wiki/Environmental_law" title="Environmental law">environmental reforms</a> incapable of facilitating large-scale change: “History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements . . . at a certain point, at which the system’s underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens.” They also note that, up until the event of total <a href="/wiki/Ecological_collapse" title="Ecological collapse">ecological collapse</a>, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).</p>
<p>Ecosocialists advocate for the <a href="/wiki/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolutionary</a> succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human needs</a>—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability. Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">Nature</a>: “What every environmentalist needs to know . . . is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, in order to create a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet.”</p>

Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of “resource wars”. This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as <a href="/wiki/Environmental_security" title="Environmental security">environmental security</a> and creates a clear need for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_environmental_agreements" title="List of environmental agreements">global environmental agreements</a> to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries, and to protect shared global systems including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oceans" title="Oceans">oceans</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Poverty">Poverty</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">Poverty</a></div>
<p>A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty. It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brundtland_Report" title="Brundtland Report">Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future</a> and the Millennium Development Goals. There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, “poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.” Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being. As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world’s poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates. The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching <a href="/wiki/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">water treatment</a> to the poor by boiling their water with <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate" title="Polyethylene terephthalate">PET</a> <a href="/wiki/Solar_water_disinfection" title="Solar water disinfection">solar water disinfection</a> would be. Also, sustainable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Best_practices" title="Best practices">best practices</a> can involve the <a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a> of materials, such as the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plastics_recycling" title="Plastics recycling">recycled</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plastics" title="Plastics">plastics</a> for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as <a href="/wiki/Bridges_to_Prosperity" title="Bridges to Prosperity">Bridges to Prosperity</a>'s use of wire rope from shipping container <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gantry_cranes" title="Gantry cranes">gantry cranes</a> to act as the structural wire rope for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Footbridges" title="Footbridges">footbridges</a> that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>One approach to <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_living" title="Sustainable living">sustainable living</a>, exemplified by small-scale urban <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transition_Towns" title="Transition Towns">transition towns</a> and rural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecovillages" title="Ecovillages">ecovillages</a>, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of <a href="/wiki/Simple_living" title="Simple living">simple living</a>, which maximize <a href="/wiki/Self-sufficiency" title="Self-sufficiency">self-sufficiency</a> particularly in food production. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a <a href="/wiki/Bioregionalism" title="Bioregionalism">bioregional</a> economy. These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_source_appropriate_technology" title="Open source appropriate technology">open source appropriate technology</a>.</p>
<p>Other approaches, loosely based around <a href="/wiki/New_Urbanism" title="New Urbanism">New Urbanism</a>, are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_cities" title="Sustainable cities">sustainable cities</a> which support <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_transport" title="Sustainable transport">sustainable transport</a>. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in <a href="/wiki/Urban_sprawl" title="Urban sprawl">sprawling</a> suburbs. In <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_architecture" title="Sustainable architecture">sustainable architecture</a> the recent movement of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_Classical_Architecture" title="New Classical Architecture">New Classical Architecture</a> promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops <a href="/wiki/Smart_growth" title="Smart growth">smart growth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vernacular_architecture" title="Vernacular architecture">architectural tradition</a> and <a href="/wiki/Classical_architecture" title="Classical architecture">classical design</a>. This in contrast to <a href="/wiki/Modern_architecture" title="Modern architecture">modernist</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_Style_(architecture)" title="International Style (architecture)">globally uniform</a> architecture, as well as opposing solitary <a href="/wiki/Housing_estate" title="Housing estate">housing estates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Urban_sprawl" title="Urban sprawl">suburban sprawl</a>. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of <a href="/wiki/Circular_flow_land_use_management" title="Circular flow land use management">Circular flow land use management</a> has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.</p>
<p>Large scale <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_movements" title="Social movements">social movements</a> can influence both community choices and the built environment. <a href="/wiki/Eco-municipality" title="Eco-municipality">Eco-municipalities</a> may be one such movement. Eco-municipalities take a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Systems" title="Systems">systems</a> approach, based on sustainability principles. The eco-municipality movement is participatory, involving community members in a bottom-up approach. In Sweden, more than 70 cities and towns—25 per cent of all municipalities in the country—have adopted a common set of <a href="/wiki/The_Natural_Step#System_conditions_of_sustainability" title="The Natural Step">"Sustainability Principles"</a> and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations. There are now twelve eco-municipalities in the United States and the <a href="/wiki/American_Planning_Association" title="American Planning Association">American Planning Association</a> has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small, inexpensive and easily achievable steps. But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes, at all levels and contexts of society. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> has recognised the central role of education, and have declared a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Decade_of_Education_for_Sustainable_Development" title="United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development">decade of education for sustainable development</a>, 2005–2014, which aims to "challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future". The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Worldwide_Fund_for_Nature" title="Worldwide Fund for Nature">Worldwide Fund for Nature</a> proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)#Cultural_values" title="Value (personal and cultural)">societal values</a> head-on and strengthen people's connections with the natural world.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_and_labor_rights">Human and labor rights</span></h3>
<p>Application of <a href="/wiki/Social_sustainability" title="Social sustainability">social sustainability</a> requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The <a href="/wiki/Equator_Principles" title="Equator Principles">Equator Principles</a> (financial industry), <a href="/wiki/Fair_Wear_Foundation" title="Fair Wear Foundation">Fair Wear Foundation</a> (garments), and <a class="external text" href="http://www.eiccoalition.org/" rel="nofollow">Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition</a> are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as <a href="/wiki/Green_Seal" title="Green Seal">Green Seal</a> for cleaning products, <a href="/wiki/NSF_International" title="NSF International">NSF</a>-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of <a href="/wiki/Organic_food" title="Organic food">Organic food</a> in the United States.</p>
