<p><b>Generation IV reactors</b> (<b>Gen IV</b>) are a set of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a> designs currently being researched for commercial applications by the Generation IV International Forum, with <a href="/wiki/Technology_readiness_level" title="Technology readiness level">Technology readiness levels</a> varying between the level requiring a demonstration, to economical competitive implementation. They are motivated by a variety of goals including improved safety, sustainability, efficiency, and cost.</p>
<p>Most of these designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030–40. Presently the majority of reactors in operation around the world are considered <a href="/wiki/Generation_II_reactor" title="Generation II reactor">second generation reactor</a> systems, as the vast majority of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Generation_I_reactor" title="Generation I reactor">first-generation</a> systems were retired some time ago, and there are only a dozen or so <a href="/wiki/Generation_III_reactor" title="Generation III reactor">Generation III reactors</a> in operation (2014). <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor#Generation_V.2B_reactors" title="Nuclear reactor">Generation V reactors</a> refer to reactors that are purely theoretical and are therefore not yet considered feasible in the short term, resulting in limited <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/R%26D" title="R&amp;D">R&amp;D</a> funding.</p>

<p>The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) is "a co-operative international endeavour which was set up to carry out the research and development needed to establish the feasibility and performance capabilities of the next generation nuclear energy systems." It was founded in 2001. There are currently ten active members of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF): <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Atomic_Energy_Community" title="European Atomic Energy Community">European Atomic Energy Community</a> (Euratom), <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. The non-active members are <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Switzerland joined in 2002, Euratom in 2003, and China and Russia in 2006. The remaining countries (excluding Australia) were founding members.</p>
<p>The 36th GIF meeting in <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> was held in November 2013. The <i>Technology Roadmap Update for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems</i> was published in January 2014 which details R&amp;D objectives for the next decade. A breakdown of the reactor designs being researched by each forum member has been made available.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactor_types">Reactor types</span></h2>
<p>Many reactor types were considered initially; however, the list was downsized to focus on the most promising technologies and those that could most likely meet the goals of the Gen IV initiative. Three systems are nominally <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_reactor" title="Thermal reactor">thermal reactors</a> and three are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_reactor" title="Fast reactor">fast reactors</a>. The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is also being researched for potentially providing high quality process heat for <a href="/wiki/Thermochemical_cycle" title="Thermochemical cycle">hydrogen production</a>. The fast reactors offer the possibility of burning <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Actinides" title="Actinides">actinides</a> to further reduce waste and of being able to "<a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breed more fuel</a>" than they consume. These systems offer significant advances in sustainability, safety and reliability, economics, proliferation resistance (depending on perspective) and physical protection.</p>

There have been many designs put forward for this type of reactor and a few prototypes built. The early concepts and many current ones rely on <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuel</a> dissolved in the molten <a href="/wiki/Fluoride" title="Fluoride">fluoride</a> salt as <a href="/wiki/Uranium_tetrafluoride" title="Uranium tetrafluoride">uranium tetrafluoride</a> (UF<sub>4</sub>) or <a href="/wiki/Thorium_tetrafluoride" title="Thorium tetrafluoride">thorium tetrafluoride</a> (ThF<sub>4</sub>).

Many current concepts rely on fuel that is dispersed in a graphite matrix with the molten salt providing low pressure, high temperature cooling.</p>
<p>The Gen IV MSR is more accurately termed an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Epithermal_neutron" title="Epithermal neutron">epithermal reactor</a> than a thermal reactor due to the average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within its fuel being faster than <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_neutron" title="Thermal neutron">thermal neutrons</a>.</p>
<p>The principle of a MSR can be used for thermal, epithermal and fast reactors. Since 2005 the focus has moved towards a fast spectrum MSR (MSFR).</p>
<p>While most MSR designs being pursued are largely derived from the 1960s <a href="/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment" title="Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment">Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment</a>(MSRE), variants of molten salt technology include the conceptual <i><a href="/wiki/Dual_fluid_reactor" title="Dual fluid reactor">Dual fluid reactor</a></i> which is being designed with lead as a cooling medium but molten salt fuel, commonly as the metal chloride e.g <a href="/wiki/Plutonium(III)_chloride" title="Plutonium(III) chloride">Plutonium(III) chloride</a>, to aid in greater "nuclear waste" closed-fuel cycle capabilities. Other notable approaches differing substantially from those with MSRE <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Pedigree" title="Pedigree">pedigree</a> include the <i>Stable Salt Reactor</i>(SSR) concept promoted by MOLTEX, which encases the molten salt in hundreds of the common solid <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fuel_rod" title="Fuel rod">fuel rods</a> that are already well established in the nuclear industry.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_water_reactor" title="Supercritical water reactor">Supercritical water reactor</a></div>
<p>The <b>supercritical water reactor</b> (SCWR) is a <a href="/wiki/Reduced_moderation_water_reactor" title="Reduced moderation water reactor">reduced moderation water reactor</a> concept that, due to the average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within the fuel being faster than <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_neutron" title="Thermal neutron">thermal neutrons</a>, it is more accurately termed an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Epithermal_neutron" title="Epithermal neutron">epithermal reactor</a> than a thermal reactor. It uses <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_fluid" title="Supercritical fluid">supercritical water</a> as the working fluid. SCWRs are basically <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactors</a> (LWR) operating at higher pressure and temperatures with a direct, once-through heat exchange cycle. As most commonly envisioned, it would operate on a direct cycle, much like a boiling water reactor (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BWR" title="BWR">BWR</a>), but since it uses supercritical water (not to be confused with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Critical_mass_(nuclear)" title="Critical mass (nuclear)">critical mass</a>) as the working fluid, it would have only one water phase present, which makes the supercritical heat exchange method more similar to a pressurized water reactor (<a href="/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor" title="Pressurized water reactor">PWR</a>). It could operate at much higher temperatures than both current PWRs and BWRs.</p>
<p>Supercritical water-cooled reactors (SCWRs) are promising advanced nuclear systems because of their high <a href="/wiki/Thermal_efficiency" title="Thermal efficiency">thermal efficiency</a> (i.e., about 45% vs. about 33% efficiency for current LWRs) and considerable plant simplification.</p>
<p>The main mission of the SCWR is generation of low-cost <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. It is built upon two proven technologies, LWRs, which are the most commonly deployed power generating reactors in the world, and superheated <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> fired <a href="/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boilers</a>, a large number of which are also in use around the world. The SCWR concept is being investigated by 32 organizations in 13 countries.</p>
<p>A SCWR Design under development is the <a href="/wiki/VVER" title="VVER">VVER</a>-1700/393 (VVER-SCWR or VVER-SKD) — a Russian Supercritical-water-cooled reactor with double-inlet-core and a <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeding ratio</a> of 0.95.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fast_reactors">Fast reactors</span></h3>

<p>The <b>gas-cooled fast reactor</b> (GFR) system features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile uranium</a> and management of actinides.

<p>The SFR is a project that builds on two closely related existing projects, the liquid metal <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor#Fast_breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">fast breeder reactor</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor" title="Integral fast reactor">integral fast reactor</a>.</p>
<p>The goals are to increase the efficiency of uranium usage by <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeding</a> plutonium and eliminating the need for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic" title="Transuranic">transuranic</a> isotopes ever to leave the site. The reactor design uses an unmoderated core running on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_neutron" title="Fast neutron">fast neutrons</a>, designed to allow any transuranic isotope to be consumed (and in some cases used as fuel). In addition to the benefits of removing the long <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a> transuranics from the waste cycle, the SFR fuel expands when the reactor overheats, and the chain reaction automatically slows down. In this manner, it is passively safe.</p>
<p>The SFR reactor concept is cooled by liquid <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> and fueled by a metallic alloy of uranium and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>, the "nuclear waste" of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactors</a>. The SFR fuel is contained in steel cladding with liquid sodium filling in the space between the clad elements which make up the fuel assembly. One of the design challenges of an SFR is the risks of handling sodium, which reacts explosively if it comes into contact with water. However, the use of liquid metal instead of water as coolant allows the system to work at atmospheric pressure, reducing the risk of leakage.</p>

<p>A specific risk of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is related to using metallic sodium as a coolant. In case of a breach, sodium explosively reacts with water. Fixing breaches may also prove dangerous, as the cheapest noble gas <a href="/wiki/Argon" title="Argon">argon</a> is also used to prevent sodium oxidation. Argon, like helium, can displace oxygen in the air and can pose <a href="/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)" title="Hypoxia (environmental)">hypoxia</a> concerns, so workers may be exposed to this additional risk. This is a pertinent problem as can be testified by the events at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LMFBR" title="LMFBR">loop type</a> <a href="/wiki/Monju_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="Monju Nuclear Power Plant">Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor Monju</a> at Tsuruga, Japan. Using lead or molten salts mitigates this problem by making the coolant less reactive and allowing a high freezing temperature and low pressure in case of a leak. Disadvantages of lead compared to sodium are much higher viscosity, much higher density, lower heat capacity, and more radioactive neutron activation products.</p>
<p>In many cases, there is already a large amount of experience built up with numerous proof of concept Gen IV designs. For example, the reactors at <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._Vrain_Generating_Station" title="Fort St. Vrain Generating Station">Fort St. Vrain Generating Station</a> and <a href="/wiki/HTR-10" title="HTR-10">HTR-10</a> are similar to the proposed Gen IV <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VHTR" title="VHTR">VHTR</a> designs, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LMFBR" title="LMFBR">pool type</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EBR-II" title="EBR-II">EBR-II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ph%C3%A9nix" title="Phénix">Phénix</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BN-600" title="BN-600">BN-600</a> reactor are similar to the proposed pool type Gen IV Sodium Cooled Fast reactors being designed.</p>
