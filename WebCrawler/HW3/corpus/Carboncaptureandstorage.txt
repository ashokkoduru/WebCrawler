<p><b>Carbon capture and storage</b> (<b>CCS</b>) (or <b>carbon capture and sequestration</b>) is the process of capturing waste <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) from large <a href="/wiki/Point_source_pollution" title="Point source pollution">point sources</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_plant" title="Fossil fuel power plant">fossil fuel power plants</a>, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere, normally an underground <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)" title="Formation (stratigraphy)">geological formation</a>. The aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere (from fossil fuel use in power generation and other industries). It is a potential means of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming" title="Mitigation of global warming">mitigating</a> the contribution of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_emissions" title="Fossil fuel emissions">fossil fuel emissions</a> to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ocean_acidification" title="Ocean acidification">ocean acidification</a>. Although CO<sub>2</sub> has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes, including <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a>, the long term storage of CO<sub>2</sub> is a relatively new concept. The first commercial example was the <a href="/wiki/Weyburn-Midale_Carbon_Dioxide_Project" title="Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project">Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project</a> in 2000. Other examples include <a href="/wiki/SaskPower" title="SaskPower">SaskPower's</a> <a href="/wiki/Boundary_Dam_Power_Station" title="Boundary Dam Power Station">Boundary Dam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_Power" title="Mississippi Power">Mississippi Power's</a> <a href="/wiki/Kemper_Project" title="Kemper Project">Kemper Project</a>. 'CCS' can also be used to describe the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">scrubbing</a> of CO<sub>2</sub> from ambient air as a <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a> technique.</p>
<p>An integrated pilot-scale CCS power plant was to begin operating in September 2008 in the eastern German power plant <a href="/wiki/Schwarze_Pumpe_power_station" title="Schwarze Pumpe power station">Schwarze Pumpe</a> run by utility <a href="/wiki/Vattenfall" title="Vattenfall">Vattenfall</a>, to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency. CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80–90% compared to a plant without CCS. The <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">IPCC</a> estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10% and 55% of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be captured out of air or fossil fuel power plant flue gas using absorption (or <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">carbon scrubbing</a>), membrane gas separation, or adsorption technologies. Amines are the leading carbon scrubbing technology. Capturing and compressing CO<sub>2</sub> may increase the energy needs of a coal-fired CCS plant by 25–40%. These and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost per watt energy produced by 21–91% for fossil fuel power plants. Applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive, especially if they are far from a sequestration site. A 2005 industry report suggests that with successful research, development and deployment (RD&amp;D), sequestered coal-based electricity generation in 2025 may cost less than unsequestered coal-based electricity generation today.</p>
<p>Storage of the CO<sub>2</sub> is envisaged either in deep geological formations, or in the form of <a href="/wiki/Mineral" title="Mineral">mineral</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbonate" title="Carbonate">carbonates</a>. Deep ocean storage is not currently considered feasible due to the associated effect of <a href="/wiki/Ocean_acidification" title="Ocean acidification">ocean acidification</a>. Geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites. The <a href="/wiki/National_Energy_Technology_Laboratory" title="National Energy Technology Laboratory">National Energy Technology Laboratory</a> (NETL) reported that North America has enough storage capacity for more than 900 years worth of carbon dioxide at current production rates. A general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain, and there is still the risk that CO<sub>2</sub> might leak into the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">Carbon dioxide scrubber</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_air_capture" title="Carbon dioxide air capture">carbon dioxide air capture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clean_coal" title="Clean coal">Clean coal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amine_gas_treating" title="Amine gas treating">Amine gas treating</a>, <a href="/wiki/Membrane_gas_separation" title="Membrane gas separation">Membrane gas separation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Metal-organic_framework" title="Metal-organic framework">Metal-organic framework</a></div>
<p>Capturing CO<sub>2</sub> is most effective at point sources, such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, industries with major CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_gas_processing" title="Natural gas processing">natural gas processing</a>, synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel-based <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_production" title="Hydrogen production">hydrogen production</a> plants. Extracting CO<sub>2</sub> from air is also possible, but not very practical because the CO<sub>2</sub> is not concentrated.</p>
<p>Organisms that produce <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation" title="Ethanol fermentation">fermentation</a> generate cool, essentially pure CO<sub>2</sub> that can be pumped underground. Fermentation produces slightly less CO<sub>2</sub> than ethanol by weight.</p>
<p>Flue gas from the combustion of coal in oxygen has a large concentration of CO2, about 10-15% CO<sub>2</sub> whereas natural gas power plant flue gas is about 5-10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, it is more energy and cost efficient to capture CO2 from coal-fired power plants. Impurities in CO<sub>2</sub> streams, like sulfurs and water, could have a significant effect on their phase behaviour and could pose a significant threat of increased corrosion of pipeline and well materials.[10] In instances where CO<sub>2</sub> impurities exist, especially with air capture, a scrubbing separation process would be needed to initially clean the flue gas. According to the Wallula Energy Resource Center in Washington state, by gasifying coal, it is possible to capture approximately 65% of carbon dioxide embedded in it and sequester it in a solid form.</p>
<p>Broadly, three different configurations of technologies for capture exist: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_combustion_capture" title="Post combustion capture">post combustion capture</a></i>, the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel — this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil-fuel burning power plants. Here, carbon dioxide is captured from <a href="/wiki/Flue_gas" title="Flue gas">flue gases</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_plant" title="Fossil fuel power plant">power stations</a> or other large point sources. The technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications, although not at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station. Post combustion capture is most popular in research because existing fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include CCS technology in this configuration.</li>
<li>The technology for <i>pre-combustion</i> is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>), and power production. In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially oxidized, for instance in a <a href="/wiki/Gasification" title="Gasification">gasifier</a>. The resulting <a href="/wiki/Syngas" title="Syngas">syngas</a> (CO and H<sub>2</sub>) is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_gas_shift_reaction" title="Water gas shift reaction">shifted</a> into CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. The resulting CO<sub>2</sub> can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H<sub>2</sub> can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture. The CO<sub>2</sub> is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option. The capture before expansion, i.e. from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial CO<sub>2</sub> capture processes, at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants.</li>
<li>In <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxy-fuel_combustion" title="Oxy-fuel combustion">oxy-fuel combustion</a></i> the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as "zero emission" cycles, because the CO<sub>2</sub> stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the CO<sub>2</sub> generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label "zero emission" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Capture_Technologies">Capture Technologies</span></h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with <a href="/wiki/Absorption_(chemistry)" title="Absorption (chemistry)">absorption</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">adsorption</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Membrane_gas_separation" title="Membrane gas separation">membrane gas separation</a> technologies. Absorption, or <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">carbon scrubbing</a>, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amines" title="Amines">amines</a> is currently the dominant capture technology. Membrane and adsorption technologies are still in the developmental research stages, initiating primary pilot plants in the near future. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metal-Organic_Framework" title="Metal-Organic Framework">Metal-Organic Frameworks</a> (MOFs) are a novel class of materials that offer promise for carbon capture using adsorption technologies.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through <a href="/wiki/Physisorption" title="Physisorption">physisorption</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chemisorption" title="Chemisorption">chemisorption</a> based on the porosity and <a href="/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity" title="Sensitivity and specificity">selectivity</a> of the MOF leaving behind a <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">Greenhouse gas</a> poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing CO<sub>2</sub>, have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much CO<sub>2</sub> as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure. As the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases. A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF. Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.</p>
<p>Capture is attributed to about two thirds of the total cost of CCS, making it limit the wide-scale deployment of CCS technologies. To optimize a CO<sub>2</sub> capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of CCS since the transport and storage steps of CCS are rather mature technologies.</p>
<p>An alternate method under development is <a href="/wiki/Chemical_looping_combustion" title="Chemical looping combustion">chemical looping combustion</a> (CLC). Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier. Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a <a href="/wiki/Fluidization" title="Fluidization">fluidized bed</a> combustor, producing solid metal particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor. The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide, which can then be sequestered. The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor. A variant of chemical looping is <a href="/wiki/Calcium_looping" title="Calcium looping">calcium looping</a>, which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a <a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" title="Calcium oxide">calcium oxide</a> based carrier as a means of capturing CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>A few engineering proposals have been made for the more difficult task of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal" title="Carbon dioxide removal">removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere</a> – a form of <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a> – but work in this area is still in its infancy. Capture costs are estimated to be higher than from point sources, but may be feasible for dealing with emissions from diffuse sources such as automobiles and aircraft. The theoretically required energy for air capture is only slightly more than for capture from point sources. The additional costs come from the devices that use the natural air flow. Global Research Technologies demonstrated a pre-prototype of air capture technology in 2007.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport">Transport</span></h2>
<p>After capture, the CO<sub>2</sub> would have to be transported to suitable storage sites. This would most likely be done by pipeline, which is generally the cheapest form of transport. In 2008, there were approximately 5,800 km of CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines in the United States, used to transport CO<sub>2</sub> to oil production fields where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil. The injection of CO<sub>2</sub> to produce oil is generally called <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enhanced_Oil_Recovery" title="Enhanced Oil Recovery">Enhanced Oil Recovery</a></i> or EOR. In addition, there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the long-term storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in non-oil producing geologic formations.</p>
<p>According to the Congressional Research Service, "There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO<sub>2</sub> itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines for <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a> are already in use today, policy decisions affecting CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines take on an urgency that is unrecognized by many. Federal classification of CO<sub>2</sub> as both a commodity (by the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management" title="Bureau of Land Management">Bureau of Land Management</a>) and as a pollutant (by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline operations today."</p>
<p>Ships could also be utilized for transport where pipelines are not feasible. These methods are currently used for transporting CO<sub>2</sub> for other applications.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sequestration">Sequestration</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sequestration" title="Carbon sequestration">Carbon sequestration</a></div>
<p>Various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of CO<sub>2</sub>. These forms include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations (including saline formations and exhausted gas fields), and solid storage by reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with metal <a href="/wiki/Oxide" title="Oxide">oxides</a> to produce stable <a href="/wiki/Carbonate" title="Carbonate">carbonates</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Geological_storage">Geological storage</span></h3>
<p>Also known as <i>geo-sequestration</i>, this method involves injecting carbon dioxide, generally in <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_fluid" title="Supercritical fluid">supercritical</a> form, directly into underground geological formations. <a href="/wiki/Oil_field" title="Oil field">Oil fields</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas_field" title="Gas field">gas fields</a>, saline formations, unmineable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_seam" title="Coal seam">coal seams</a>, and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites. Various physical (e.g., highly impermeable <a href="/wiki/Caprock" title="Caprock">caprock</a>) and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the CO<sub>2</sub> from escaping to the surface.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">increase oil recovery</a>. Approximately 30 to 50 million metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> are injected annually in the United States into declining oil fields. This option is attractive because the geology of hydrocarbon reservoirs is generally well understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited capacity, as well as the fact that subsequent burning of the additional oil recovered will offset much or all of the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>Unmineable coal seams can be used to store CO<sub>2</sub> because the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules attach to the surface of coal. The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, and the methane can be recovered (<a href="/wiki/Enhanced_coal_bed_methane_recovery" title="Enhanced coal bed methane recovery">enhanced coal bed methane recovery</a>). The sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the CO<sub>2</sub> storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Saline formations contain highly mineralized brines, and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans. Saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases. The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them, especially compared to oil fields. To keep the cost of storage acceptable, the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost. Leakage of CO<sub>2</sub> back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline aquifer storage. Current research shows, however, that <i>trapping mechanisms</i> such as structural trapping, residual trapping, solubility trapping and mineral trapping could immobilize the CO<sub>2</sub> underground and reduce the risk of leakage.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Enhanced_oil_recovery">Enhanced oil recovery</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">Enhanced oil recovery</a> (EOR) is a generic term for techniques used to increase the amount of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a> that can be extracted from an <a href="/wiki/Oil_field" title="Oil field">oil field</a>. In Carbon Capture &amp; Sequestration Enhanced Oil Recovery (CCS EOR), carbon dioxide is injected into an oil field to recover oil that is often never recovered using more traditional methods.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">Crude oil</a> development and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include up to three distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_reservoir" title="Oil reservoir">reservoir's</a> original oil in place is typically produced. Secondary recovery techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wellbore" title="Wellbore">wellbore</a>, resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, with much of the easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a> (EOR), techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.</p>
<p>An example of a project that will use CCS EOR is the <a href="/wiki/Kemper_Project" title="Kemper Project">Kemper Project</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. Due to the Kemper Project's close proximity to oil fields, the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Byproduct" title="Byproduct">byproduct</a> from producing <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> will be transported to the neighboring <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_fields" title="Oil fields">oil fields</a> for <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">EOR</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ocean_storage">Ocean storage</span></h3>
<p>In the past, it was suggested that CO<sub>2</sub> could be stored in the oceans, but this would only exacerbate <a href="/wiki/Ocean_acidification" title="Ocean acidification">ocean acidification</a> and has been made illegal under specific regulations. Ocean storage is no longer considered feasible.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mineral_storage">Mineral storage</span></h3>
<p>In this process, CO<sub>2</sub> is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exothermic" title="Exothermic">exothermically</a> reacted with available metal oxides, which in turn produces stable carbonates (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Calcite" title="Calcite">calcite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magnesite" title="Magnesite">magnesite</a>). This process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for a great amount of surface <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a>. The idea of using <a href="/wiki/Olivine" title="Olivine">olivine</a> has been promoted by the geochemist Prof. Schuiling. The reaction rate can be made faster, for example, with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> or by reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressures, or by pre-treatment of the minerals, although this method can require additional energy. The <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">IPCC</a> estimates that a power plant equipped with CCS using mineral storage will need 60–180% more energy than a power plant without CCS.</p>
<p>The economics of mineral carbonation at scale are now being tested in a world-first pilot plant project based in Newcastle, Australia. New techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the GreenMag Group and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Newcastle_(Australia)" title="University of Newcastle (Australia)">University of Newcastle</a> and funded by the <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> and Australian Governments to be operational by 2013.</p>
<p>In 2009 it was reported that scientists had mapped 6,000 square miles (16,000 km) of rock formations in the U.S. that could be used to store 500 years' worth of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. A study on mineral sequestration in the US states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring Mg and Ca containing minerals with CO<sub>2</sub> to form carbonates has many unique advantages. Most notabl[e] is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than CO<sub>2</sub>, which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally (e.g., the weathering of rock over geologic time periods). Secondly, the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following table lists principal metal oxides of <a href="/wiki/Crust_(geology)" title="Crust (geology)">Earth's Crust</a>. Theoretically, up to 22% of this mineral mass is able to form <a href="/wiki/Carbonate" title="Carbonate">carbonates</a>.</p>

<p>Ultramafic mine tailings are a readily available source of fine-grained metal oxides that can act as artificial carbon sinks to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the mining industry. Accelerating passive CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration via mineral carbonation may be achieved through microbial processes that enhance mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_requirements">Energy requirements</span></h3>
<p>The energy requirements of sequestration processes may be significant. In one paper, sequestration consumed 25 percent of the plant's rated 600-megawatt output capacity.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leakage">Leakage</span></h2>

<p>A major concern with CCS is whether leakage of stored CO<sub>2</sub> will compromise CCS as a climate change mitigation option. For well-selected, designed and managed geological storage sites, IPCC estimates that risks are comparable to those associated with current hydrocarbon activity. However, this finding is contested due to a lack of experience in such long term storage. CO<sub>2</sub> could be trapped for millions of years, and although some leakage occurs upwards through the soil, well selected storage sites are likely to retain over 99% of the injected CO<sub>2</sub> over 1000 years. Leakage through the injection pipe is a greater risk.</p>
<p>Although the injection pipe is usually protected with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-return_valve" title="Non-return valve">non-return valves</a> to prevent release on a power outage, there is still a risk that the pipe itself could tear and leak due to the pressure. The <a href="/wiki/Berkel_en_Rodenrijs" title="Berkel en Rodenrijs">Berkel en Rodenrijs</a> incident in December 2008 was an example, where a modest release of CO<sub>2</sub> from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there. In order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage, the implementation of CO<sub>2</sub> alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed. Malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released CO<sub>2</sub> and 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road. A release of CO<sub>2</sub> from a salt mine killed a person at distance of 300 meters.</p>
<p>In 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> rose from <a href="/wiki/Lake_Nyos" title="Lake Nyos">Lake Nyos</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cameroon" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> and asphyxiated 1,700 people. While the carbon had been sequestered naturally, some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially. The <a href="/wiki/Lake_Nyos" title="Lake Nyos">Lake Nyos</a> disaster resulted from a volcanic event, which very suddenly released as much as a cubic kilometre of CO<sub>2</sub> gas from a pool of naturally occurring CO<sub>2</sub> under the lake in a deep narrow valley. The location of this pool of CO<sub>2</sub> is not a place where man can inject or store CO<sub>2</sub>, and this pool was not known about nor monitored until after the occurrence of the natural disaster.</p>
<p>For ocean storage, the retention of CO<sub>2</sub> would depend on the depth. The IPCC estimates 30–85% of the sequestered carbon dioxide would be retained after 500 years for depths 1000–3000 m. Mineral storage is not regarded as having any risks of leakage. The IPCC recommends that limits be set to the amount of leakage that can take place. This might rule out deep ocean storage as an option.</p>
<p>At the conditions of the deeper oceans, (about 400 bar or 40 MPa, 280 K) water–CO<sub>2</sub>(l) mixing is <i>very</i> low (where carbonate formation/acidification is the rate limiting step), but the formation of water-CO<sub>2</sub> hydrates, a kind of solid water cage that surrounds the CO<sub>2</sub>, is favorable.</p>
<p>To further investigate the safety of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration, Norway's <a href="/wiki/Sleipner_gas_field" title="Sleipner gas field">Sleipner gas field</a> can be studied, as it is the oldest plant that stores CO<sub>2</sub> on an industrial scale. According to an environmental assessment of the gas field which was conducted after ten years of operation, the author affirmed that geosequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> was the most definite form of permanent <i>geological</i> storage of CO<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the Utsira formation [saline reservoir]. This implies that the geological environment is tectonically stable and a site suitable for carbon dioxide storage. The solubility trapping [is] the most permanent and secure form of geological storage.</p>

<p>In March 2009 StatoilHydro issued a study showing the slow spread of CO<sub>2</sub> in the formation after more than 10 years operation.</p>
<p>Phase I of the <a href="/wiki/Weyburn-Midale_Carbon_Dioxide_Project" title="Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project">Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weyburn,_Saskatchewan" title="Weyburn, Saskatchewan">Weyburn, Saskatchewan</a>, Canada has determined that the likelihood of stored CO<sub>2</sub> release is less than one percent in 5,000 years. A January 2011 report, however, claimed <a href="/wiki/Weyburn-Midale_Carbon_Dioxide_Project#Claims_of_leaking" title="Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project">evidence of leakage</a> in land above that project. This report was strongly refuted by the IEAGHG Weyburn-Midale CO<sub>2</sub> Monitoring and Storage Project, which issued an eight-page analysis of the study, claiming that it showed no evidence of leakage from the reservoir.</p>
<p>The liability of potential leak(s) is one of the largest barriers to large-scale CCS. To assess and reduce such liability, the leakage of stored gasses, particularly <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, into the atmosphere may be detected via atmospheric gas monitoring, and can be quantified directly via the <a href="/wiki/Eddy_covariance" title="Eddy covariance">eddy covariance</a> flux measurements,</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Monitoring_geological_sequestration_sites">Monitoring geological sequestration sites</span></h2>
<p>In order to detect carbon dioxide leaks and the effectiveness of geological sequestration sites, different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir. Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cap_and_trade" title="Cap and trade">cap and trade</a> policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored CO<sub>2</sub>, there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subsurface_monitoring">Subsurface monitoring</span></h3>
<p>In subsurface monitoring, there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the reservoir. A direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample. This drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock. It also only provides data at a specific location. Indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted. This approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region; it does however lack precision. Both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Seismic_monitoring">Seismic monitoring</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Seismometer" title="Seismometer">Seismic monitoring</a> is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring. It is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a <a href="/wiki/Seismic_vibrator" title="Seismic vibrator">vibroseis truck</a>, or inside a well using <a href="/wiki/Rotating_unbalance" title="Rotating unbalance">spinning eccentric mass</a>. These vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers. It can identify migration pathways of the CO<sub>2</sub> plume. Two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the <a href="/wiki/Sleipner_gas_field" title="Sleipner gas field">Sleipner sequestration project</a> and the Frio CO<sub>2</sub> Injection test. Although this method can confirm the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> in a given region, it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Surface_monitoring">Surface monitoring</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Eddy_covariance" title="Eddy covariance">Eddy covariance</a> is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of CO<sub>2</sub> from the ground’s surface. It involves measuring CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer. This provides a measure of the total vertical flux of CO2. Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks, however, the natural carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants, would have to be accounted for and a baseline CO<sub>2</sub> cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring. An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the <a class="external text" href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/397007sh" rel="nofollow">Shallow Release test</a>. Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers. These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer. This also measures the vertical flux of CO<sub>2</sub>. The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting CO<sub>2</sub> leaks over the entire sequestration site.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="InSAR_monitoring">InSAR monitoring</span></h3>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/InSAR" title="InSAR">InSAR</a> monitoring is another type of surface monitoring. It involves a satellite sending signals down to the Earth’s surface where it is reflected back to the satellite’s receiver. From this, the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point. In CCS, the injection of CO<sub>2</sub> in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures. These high pressured, fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape. In areas of stored CO<sub>2</sub>, the ground’s surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers. These changes in elevation of the Earth’s surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the inSAR satellite which is then detectable and measurable.</p>

<p>Recycling CO<sub>2</sub> may offer a response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary (industrial) emitters in the near to medium term, but is usually considered a different technological category from CCS. Technologies under development, such as Bio CCS Algal Synthesis, utilises pre-smokestack CO<sub>2</sub> (such as from a coal-fired power station) as a useful feedstock input to the production of oil-rich algae in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel (including aviation fuel), and nutritious stock-feed for farm animal production. The CO<sub>2</sub> and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes containing waste water and select strains of algae causing, together with sunlight or UV light, an oil rich biomass that doubles in mass every 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Bio CCS Algal Synthesis process is based on earth science photosynthesis: the technology is entirely retrofittable and collocated with the emitter, and the capital outlays may offer a return upon investment due to the high value commodities produced (oil for plastics, fuel and feed).</p>
<p>Bio CCS Algal Synthesis test facilities were being trialed at Australia's three largest coal-fired power stations (Tarong, Queensland; Eraring, NSW; Loy Yang, Victoria) using piped pre-emission smokestack CO<sub>2</sub> (and other greenhouse gases) as feedstock to grow oil-rich algal biomass in enclosed membranes for the production of plastics, transport fuel and nutritious animal feed.</p>
<p>Another potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of CO<sub>2</sub> is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics. There are a number of projects investigating this possibility.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">Carbon dioxide scrubbing</a> variants exist based on <a href="/wiki/Potassium_carbonate" title="Potassium carbonate">potassium carbonate</a> which can be used to create liquid fuels, though this process requires a great deal of energy input. Although the creation of fuel from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is not a <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a> technique, nor does it actually function as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_remediation" title="Greenhouse gas remediation">greenhouse gas remediation</a> (because carbon dioxide will be re-released when the fuel is burned) it nevertheless is potentially useful in the creation of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_carbon" title="Low carbon">low carbon</a> economy.</p>
<p>Other uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Olivine" title="Olivine">olivine</a> produces <a href="/wiki/Magnesium_carbonate" title="Magnesium carbonate">Magnesium carbonate</a>. This process is still in the R&amp;D phase.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Single_step_methods:_methanol">Single step methods: methanol</span></h3>
<p>A proven process to produce a hydrocarbon is to make <a href="/wiki/Methanol" title="Methanol">methanol</a>. Methanol is easily synthesized from CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. Based on this fact the idea of a <a href="/wiki/Methanol_economy" title="Methanol economy">methanol economy</a> was born.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Single_step_methods:_hydrocarbons">Single step methods: hydrocarbons</span></h3>
<p>At the department of Industrial Chemistry and Engineering of Materials at the University of Messina, Italy, there is a project to develop a system which works like a fuel-cell in reverse, whereby a catalyst is used that enables sunlight to split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas. The ions cross a membrane where they react with the CO<sub>2</sub> to create hydrocarbons.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Two_step_methods">Two step methods</span></h3>
<p>If CO<sub>2</sub> is heated to 2400 °C, it splits into carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch_process" title="Fischer-Tropsch process">Fischer-Tropsch process</a> can then be used to convert the CO into hydrocarbons. The required temperature can be achieved by using a chamber containing a mirror to focus sunlight on the gas. Rival teams are developing such chambers, at Solarec and at <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a>, both based in <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>.

Once operational, the Kemper Project will be a first-of-its-kind electricity plant to employ gasification and carbon capture technologies at this scale.</p>
<p>However, there have been project management problems. The power plant construction has been delayed and is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2016, more than two years behind schedule, at a cost of $6.6 billion—three times original cost estimate. According to a <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Club" title="Sierra Club">Sierra Club</a> analysis, Kemper is the most expensive power plant ever built for the watts of electricity it will generate.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>The government of the United Kingdom launched a first tender process for a CCS demonstration project in 2007. The project were to use post-combustion technology on coal-fired power generation at 300–400 megawatts or equivalent. The project aimed to be operational by 2014. The Government announced in June 2008 that four companies had pre-qualified for the competition: BP Alternative Energy International Limited, EON UK Plc, Peel Power Limited and Scottish Power Generation Limited. BP subsequently withdrew from the competition, claiming it could not find a power generator partner, and RWE <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Npower_(UK)" title="Npower (UK)">npower</a> sought a judicial review of the process after it did not qualify. This first CCS tender was cancelled in late 2011 when government could not reach agreement with the ScottishPower/Shell/National Grid consortium on terms and cost, for the project based on retrofitting the existing Longannet coal-fired power station in Scotland.</p>
<p>A second tender process was launched by government in 2012 as part of DECC's CCS Commercialisation Programme and two bidders, namely the Shell Peterhead gas-fired power station CCS project and the White Rose CCS project based upon a new oxy-fuel coal-fired unit at Drax power station were selected in 2013 to proceed to a funded front-end engineering and design phase. This second tender was cancelled in November 2015 following a government spending review at the time of the Chancellor's Autumn Statement.</p>
<p>Doosan Babcock has modified their Clean Combustion Test Facility (CCTF) in Renfrew, Scotland to create the largest Oxyfuel test facility currently in the world. Oxyfuel firing on pulverized coal with recycled flue gas demonstrates the operation of a full scale 40 MW burner for use in coal-fired boilers. Sponsors of the project include the UK Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR,) as well as a group of industrial sponsors and university partners comprising Scottish and Southern Energy (Prime Sponsor), E.ON UK PLC, Drax Power Limited, ScottishPower, EDF Energy, Dong Energy Generation, Air Products Plc (Sponsors), and Imperial College and University of Nottingham (University Partners).</p>
<p>In 2009 UK firm 2Co Energy was awarded planning permission for a £5bn power station and carbon-capture-and-storage project at Hatfield, near Doncaster and £164m of EU funding. Technology company Samsung agreed to take a 15% stake in the project. It is planned to construct a 60 km (37 mi) pipeline from Stainforth, near Hatfield in South Yorkshire to Barmston in the East Riding of Yorkshire. CO<sub>2</sub> would then be stored in natural porous rock beneath the North Sea. National Grid believes the project has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from power stations across Yorkshire and the Humber by up to 90% and both the proposed White Rose CCS project at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire and the proposed Don Valley Power Project at Hatfield could benefit from the scheme.</p>

<p>The German industrial area of Schwarze Pumpe, about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of the city of <a href="/wiki/Spremberg" title="Spremberg">Spremberg</a>, is home to the world's first demonstration CCS coal plant, the <a href="/wiki/Schwarze_Pumpe_power_station" title="Schwarze Pumpe power station">Schwarze Pumpe power station</a>. The mini pilot plant is run by an <a href="/wiki/Alstom" title="Alstom">Alstom</a>-built <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxy-fuel" title="Oxy-fuel">oxy-fuel</a> boiler and is also equipped with a flue gas cleaning facility to remove <a href="/wiki/Fly_ash" title="Fly ash">fly ash</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sulphur_dioxide" title="Sulphur dioxide">sulphur dioxide</a>. The Swedish company <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vattenfall_AB" title="Vattenfall AB">Vattenfall AB</a> invested some €70 million in the two-year project, which began operation September 9, 2008. The power plant, which is rated at 30 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatts</a>, is a pilot project to serve as a prototype for future full-scale power plants. 240 tonnes a day of CO<sub>2</sub> are being trucked 350 kilometers (220 mi) where it will be injected into an empty gas field.

CO2CRC is a non profit research collaboration supported by government and industry. The project has stored and monitored over 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-rich gas which was extracted from a natural gas reservoir via a well, compressed and piped 2.25 km to a new well. There the gas has been injected into a depleted natural gas reservoir approximately two kilometers below the surface. The project has moved to a second stage and is investigating carbon dioxide trapping in a saline aquifer 1500 meters below the surface. The Otway Project is a research and demonstration project, focused on comprehensive monitoring and verification.</p>
<p>This plant does not propose to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from coal-fired power generation, though two CO2CRC demonstration projects at a Victorian power station and research gasifier are demonstrating solvent, membrane, and adsorbent capture technologies from coal combustion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Limitations_of_CCS_for_power_stations">Limitations of CCS for power stations</span></h2>
<p>Critics say large-scale CCS deployment is unproven and decades away from being commercialized. They say that it is risky and expensive and that a better option is <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>. Some environmental groups point out that CCS technology leaves behind dangerous waste material that has to be stored, just like nuclear power stations.</p>
<p>Another limitation of CCS is its energy penalty. The technology is expected to use between 10 and 40 percent of the energy produced by a power station. Wide-scale adoption of CCS may erase efficiency gains in coal power plants of the last 50 years, and increase resource consumption by one third. Even taking the fuel penalty into account, however, overall levels of CO<sub>2</sub> abatement would remain high at approximately 80–90%, compared to a plant without CCS. It is possible for CCS, when combined with biomass, to result in net negative emissions. Though, all of the currently (as of Feb 2011) operational BECCS (<a href="/wiki/Bio-energy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage">Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage</a>) plants operate on point emissions other than power stations, such as <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a> refineries.</p>
<p>The use of CCS can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the stacks of coal power plants by 85–90% or more, but it has no effect on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to the mining and transport of coal. It will actually "increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological, land-use, air-pollution, and water-pollution impacts from coal mining, transport, and processing, because the CCS system requires 25% more energy, thus 25% more coal combustion, than does a system without CCS".</p>
<p>Another concern regards the permanence of storage schemes. Opponents to CCS claim that safe and permanent storage of CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be guaranteed and that even very low leakage rates could undermine any climate mitigation effect. In 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> rose from <a href="/wiki/Lake_Nyos" title="Lake Nyos">Lake Nyos</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cameroon" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> and asphyxiated 1,700 people. While the carbon had been sequestered naturally, some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially.</p>
<p>On one hand, <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> claims that CCS could lead to a doubling of coal plant costs. It is also claimed by opponents to CCS that money spent on CCS will divert investments away from other solutions to climate change. On the other hand, CCS is pointed out as economically attractive in comparison to other forms of low carbon electricity generation and seen by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IPCC" title="IPCC">IPCC</a> and others as a critical component for meeting <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation_scenarios" title="Climate change mitigation scenarios">mitigation targets</a> such as 450 ppm and 350 ppm.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost">Cost</span></h2>
<p>Although the processes involved in CCS have been demonstrated in other industrial applications, no commercial scale projects which integrate these processes exist; the costs therefore are somewhat uncertain. Some recent credible estimates indicate that the cost of capturing and storing carbon dioxide is US$60 per ton, corresponding to an increase in electricity prices of about US 6c per kWh (based on typical coal-fired power plant emissions of 0.97 kg (2.13 lb) CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh). This would double the typical US industrial electricity price (now at around 6c per kWh) and increase the typical retail residential electricity price by about 50% (assuming 100% of power is from coal, which may not necessarily be the case, as this varies from state to state). Similar (approximate) price increases would likely be expected in coal dependent countries such as Australia, because the capture technology and chemistry, as well as the transport and injection costs from such power plants would not, in an overall sense, vary significantly from country to country.</p>
<p>The reasons that CCS is expected to cause such power price increases are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing CO<sub>2</sub> significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 25% for a coal-fired plant, and about 15% for a gas-fired plant. The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs, are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30–60%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible. In the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage, Walker Architects published the first CO<sub>2</sub> gas <a href="/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage" title="Compressed air energy storage">CAES</a> application, proposing the use of sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> for Energy Storage on October 24, 2008. To date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined.</p>

<p>The cost of CCS depends on the cost of capture and storage, which varies according to the method used. Geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost US$0.50–8.00 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> injected, plus an additional US$0.10–0.30 for monitoring costs. When storage is combined with <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" title="Enhanced oil recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a> to extract extra oil from an oil field, however, the storage could yield net benefits of US$10–16 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> injected (based on 2003 oil prices). This would likely negate some of the effect of the carbon capture when the oil was burnt as fuel. Even taking this into account, as the table above shows, the benefits do not outweigh the extra costs of capture.</p>
<p>Cost of electricity generated by different sources including those incorporating CCS technologies can be found in <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source" title="Cost of electricity by source">cost of electricity by source</a>. If CO<sub>2</sub> capture was part of a fuel cycle then the CO<sub>2</sub> would have value rather than be a cost. The proposed Solar Fuel or methane cycle proposed by the <a href="/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society" title="Fraunhofer Society">Fraunhofer Society</a> amongst others is an example. This "solar fuel" cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is then combined with CO<sub>2</sub> to create synthetic natural gas SNG and stored in the gas network. See the latest Cost Report on the Cost of CO<sub>2</sub> Capture produced by the <a class="external text" href="http://www.zeroemissionsplatform.eu/library/publication/166-zep-cost-report-capture.html" rel="nofollow">Zero Emissions Platform</a></p>
<p>Governments around the world have provided a range of different types of funding support to CCS demonstration projects, including tax credits, allocations and grants. The funding is associated with both a desire to accelerate innovation activities for CCS as a low-carbon technology and the need for economic stimulus activities. As of 2011, approximately US$23.5bn has been made available to support large-scale CCS demonstration projects around the world.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carbon_capture_and_storage_and_the_Kyoto_Protocol">Carbon capture and storage and the Kyoto Protocol</span></h3>
<p>One way to finance future CCS projects could be through the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Development_Mechanism" title="Clean Development Mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>. At <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COP16" title="COP16">COP16</a> in 2010, The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, at its thirty-third session, issued a draft document recommending the inclusion of Carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations in Clean Development Mechanism project activities. At <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COP17" title="COP17">COP17</a> in <a href="/wiki/Durban" title="Durban">Durban</a>, a final agreement was reached enabling CCS projects to receive support through the Clean Development Mechanism.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_effects">Environmental effects</span></h2>

<p>The theoretical merit of CCS systems is the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to 90%, depending on plant type. Generally, environmental effects from use of CCS arise during power production, CO<sub>2</sub> capture, transport, and storage. Issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections.</p>
<p>Additional energy is required for CO<sub>2</sub> capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. For new super-critical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current technology, the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40%, while for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants the range is 11–22% and for coal-based gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems it is 14–25% [IPCC, 2005]. Obviously, fuel use and environmental problems arising from mining and extraction of coal or gas increase accordingly. Plants equipped with <a href="/wiki/Flue-gas_desulfurization" title="Flue-gas desulfurization">flue-gas desulfurization</a> (FGD) systems for <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> control require proportionally greater amounts of <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a>, and systems equipped with <a href="/wiki/Selective_catalytic_reduction" title="Selective catalytic reduction">selective catalytic reduction</a> systems for <a href="/wiki/NOx" title="NOx">nitrogen oxides produced during combustion</a> require proportionally greater amounts of <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>.</p>
<p>IPCC has provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs (see table below). While CO<sub>2</sub> is drastically reduced though never completely captured, emissions of air pollutants increase significantly, generally due to the energy penalty of capture. Hence, the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality. Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology. CO<sub>2</sub> is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic CO<sub>2</sub> at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing CO<sub>2</sub> at higher temperatures in a desorber. Chilled Ammonia CCS Plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air. "Functionalized Ammonia" emit less ammonia, but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide, which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx. Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions. Nevertheless, all the capture plants amines have in common, that practically 100% of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas, the same applies to dust/ash.</p>
