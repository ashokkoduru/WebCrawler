<p>A <b>system</b> is a set of <a href="/wiki/Interaction" title="Interaction">interacting</a> or interdependent component parts forming a complex/intricate whole. Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.</p>
<p>The term <i>system</i> may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure or behavior. Alternatively, and usually in the context of complex social systems, the term is used to describe the set of rules that govern structure or behavior.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The term "system" comes from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>systēma</i>, in turn from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύστημα</span> <i>systēma</i>: "whole compounded of several parts or members, system", literary "composition".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"System" means "something to look at". You must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization. In philosophy, before Descartes, there was no "system". Plato had no "system". Aristotle had no "system".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 19th century the French physicist <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot" title="Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot">Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot</a>, who studied <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, pioneered the development of the concept of a "system" in the natural sciences. In 1824 he studied the system which he called the <i>working substance</i> (typically a body of water vapor) in steam engines, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (to which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius" title="Rudolf Clausius">Rudolf Clausius</a> generalized this picture to include the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Environment_(systems)" title="Environment (systems)">surroundings</a> and began to use the term "working body" when referring to the system.</p>
<p>The biologist <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy" title="Ludwig von Bertalanffy">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a> (1901-1972) became one of the pioneers of the <a href="/wiki/Systems_theory" title="Systems theory">general systems theory</a>. In 1945 he introduced <i>models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relation or 'forces' between them.</i></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Norbert_Wiener" title="Norbert Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a> (1894-1964) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_Ross_Ashby" title="William Ross Ashby">Ross Ashby</a> (1903-1972), who pioneered the use of mathematics to study systems, carried out significant development in the concept of a <i>system</i>.</p>
<p>In the 1980s <a href="/wiki/John_Henry_Holland" title="John Henry Holland">John H. Holland</a> (1929- ), <a href="/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann" title="Murray Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> (1929- ) and others coined the term "<a href="/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system" title="Complex adaptive system">complex adaptive system</a>" at the interdisciplinary <a href="/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute" title="Santa Fe Institute">Santa Fe Institute</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_of_systems">Analysis of systems</span></h2>
<p>Evidently, there are many types of systems that can be analyzed both <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_research" title="Quantitative research">quantitatively</a> and <a href="/wiki/Qualitative_research" title="Qualitative research">qualitatively</a>. For example, with an analysis of urban systems dynamics, [A.W. Steiss] defines five intersecting systems, including the physical subsystem and behavioral system. For sociological models influenced by systems theory, where <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_D._Bailey_(sociologist)" title="Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)">Kenneth D. Bailey</a> defines systems in terms of <a href="/wiki/Conceptual_system" title="Conceptual system">conceptual</a>, <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> and abstract systems; either <a href="/wiki/Isolated_system" title="Isolated system">isolated</a>, <a href="/wiki/Closed_system" title="Closed system">closed</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory)" title="Open system (systems theory)">open</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walter_F._Buckley" title="Walter F. Buckley">Walter F. Buckley</a> defines social systems in sociology in terms of <a href="/wiki/Mechanics" title="Mechanics">mechanical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Organic_(model)" title="Organic (model)">organic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Process_modeling" title="Process modeling">process</a> models. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bela_H._Banathy" title="Bela H. Banathy">Bela H. Banathy</a> cautions that with any inquiry into a system that understanding the type of system is crucial and defines Natural and Designed systems.</p>
<p>Systems that are purposed by man inherently have a major flaw they must have a starting assumption(s) in which this starting assumption(s) is used to build further knowledge upon. This starting assumption(s) is not inherently bad, but it is used as the foundation of the system and as it is assumed to be true, and not definitively so then the system is not as structurally sound as perceived to be. For example, in Geometry (a subsystem of Math) this is highly evident when one goes through the process of taking theorems and extrapolates proofs from those set theorems.</p>
<p>In offering these more global definitions, the author maintains that it is important not to confuse one for the other. The theorist explains that natural systems include sub-atomic systems, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Living_systems_theory" title="Living systems theory">living systems</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_system" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Galactic" title="Galactic">galactic</a> system and the Universe. Designed systems are our creations, our physical structures, hybrid systems which include natural and designed systems, and our conceptual knowledge. The human element of organization and activities are emphasized with their relevant abstract systems and representations. A key consideration in making distinctions among various types of systems is to determine how much freedom the system has to select purpose, goals, methods, tools, etc. and how widely is the freedom to select itself distributed (or concentrated) in the system.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/George_J._Klir" title="George J. Klir">George J. Klir</a> maintains that no "classification is complete and perfect for all purposes," and defines systems in terms of abstract, <a href="/wiki/The_Real" title="The Real">real</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Conceptual_system" title="Conceptual system">conceptual</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Physical_systems" title="Physical systems">physical systems</a>, bounded and <a href="/wiki/Unbounded_system" title="Unbounded system">unbounded systems</a>, discrete to continuous, pulse to <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_system" title="Hybrid system">hybrid systems</a>, etc. The interaction between systems and their environments are categorized in terms of relatively closed, and <a href="/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory)" title="Open system (systems theory)">open systems</a>. It seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or, if it did, that it could be known by us. Important distinctions have also been made between hard and soft systems. Hard systems are technical in nature and amenable to methods such as <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">systems engineering</a>, operations research and quantitative systems analysis. Soft systems involve people and organisations and are commonly associated with concepts developed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Checkland" title="Peter Checkland">Peter Checkland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brian_Wilson_(systems_scientist)" title="Brian Wilson (systems scientist)">Brian Wilson</a> through <i>Soft Systems Methodology</i> (SSM) involving methods such as <a href="/wiki/Action_research" title="Action research">action research</a> and emphasizing participatory designs. Where hard systems might be identified as more "scientific," the distinction between them is actually often hard to define.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_system">Cultural system</span></h3>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Application_of_the_system_concept">Application of the system concept</span></h2>
<p>Systems modeling is generally a basic principle in engineering and in social sciences. The system is the representation of the entities under concern. Hence inclusion to or exclusion from system context is dependent of the intention of the modeler.</p>
<p>No model of a system will include all features of the real system of concern, and no model of a system must include all entities belonging to a real system of concern.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> and <a href="/wiki/Information_science" title="Information science">information science</a>, <b>system</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Software_system" title="Software system">software system</a> which has <a href="/wiki/Component_(UML)" title="Component (UML)">components</a> as its structure and observable <a href="/wiki/Inter-process_communication" title="Inter-process communication">inter-process communications</a> as its behavior. Again, an example will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with <a href="/wiki/Roman_numerals" title="Roman numerals">Roman numerals</a>, and various systems for filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the <a href="/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification" title="Dewey Decimal Classification">Dewey Decimal System</a> is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected together (in this case in order to facilitate the flow of information).</p>
<p>System can also be used referring to a framework, be it software or hardware, designed to allow software programs to run, see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Platform_(computing)" title="Platform (computing)">platform</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>, a physical system is the portion of the universe that is being studied (of which a <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamic_system" title="Thermodynamic system">thermodynamic system</a> is one major example). Engineering also has the concept of a system that refers to all of the parts and interactions between parts of a complex project. <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">Systems engineering</a> refers to the branch of engineering that studies how this type of system should be planned, designed, implemented, built, and maintained.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Systems_in_social_and_cognitive_sciences_and_management_research">Systems in social and cognitive sciences and management research</span></h3>
<p>Social and cognitive sciences recognize systems in human person models and in human societies. They include human brain functions and human mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and social/cultural behavioral patterns.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Management_science" title="Management science">management science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Operations_research" title="Operations research">operations research</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organizational_development" title="Organizational development">organizational development</a> (OD), human organizations are viewed as <b>systems</b> (conceptual systems) of interacting components such as subsystems or system aggregates, which are carriers of numerous complex <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Business_processes" title="Business processes">business processes</a> (<a href="/wiki/Organizational_behavior" title="Organizational behavior">organizational behaviors</a>) and organizational structures. Organizational development theorist <a href="/wiki/Peter_Senge" title="Peter Senge">Peter Senge</a> developed the notion of organizations as systems in his book <i>The Fifth Discipline</i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Systems_thinking" title="Systems thinking">Systems thinking</a> is a style of thinking/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reasoning" title="Reasoning">reasoning</a> and problem solving. It starts from the recognition of system properties in a given problem. It can be a leadership competency. Some people can <i>think globally while acting locally</i>. Such people consider the potential consequences of their decisions on other parts of larger systems. This is also a basis of systemic coaching in psychology.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Organizational_studies" title="Organizational studies">Organizational theorists</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Margaret_Wheatley" title="Margaret Wheatley">Margaret Wheatley</a> have also described the workings of organizational systems in new metaphoric contexts, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quantum_physics" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theory</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self-organizing_systems" title="Self-organizing systems">self-organization of systems</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pure_logical_systems">Pure logical systems</span></h3>
<p>There is also such a thing as a logical system. The most obvious example is the calculus developed simultaneously by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leibniz" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>. Another example is <a href="/wiki/George_Boole" title="George Boole">George Boole</a>'s Boolean operators. Other examples have related specifically to philosophy, biology, or cognitive science. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs" title="Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</a> applies psychology to biology by using pure logic. Numerous psychologists, including <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> have developed systems which logically organize psychological domains, such as personalities, motivations, or intellect and desire. Often these domains consist of general categories following a <a href="/wiki/Corollary" title="Corollary">Corollary</a> such as a <a href="/wiki/Theorem" title="Theorem">Theorem</a>. Logic has been applied to categories such as <a href="/wiki/Taxonomy_(general)" title="Taxonomy (general)">Taxonomy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontology" title="Ontology">Ontology</a>, <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Assessment" title="Assessment">Assessment</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hierarchies" title="Hierarchies">Hierarchies</a>.</p>

<p>In 1988, military strategist, <a href="/wiki/John_A._Warden_III" title="John A. Warden III">John A.

Each ring—Leadership, Processes, Infrastructure, Population and Action Units—could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change. The model was used effectively by Air Force planners in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_Gulf_War" title="First Gulf War">First Gulf War</a>.
