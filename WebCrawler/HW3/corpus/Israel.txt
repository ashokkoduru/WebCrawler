<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology"><span id="Etymology"></span> Etymology</span></h2>

<p>Upon independence in 1948, the country formally adopted the name "State of Israel" (<i>Medinat Yisrael</i>) after other proposed historical and religious names including <i>Eretz Israel</i> ("the <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>"), <a href="/wiki/Zion" title="Zion">Zion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Judea" title="Judea">Judea</a>, were considered and rejected. In the early weeks of independence, the government chose the term "Israeli" to denote a citizen of Israel, with the formal announcement made by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Minister_of_Israel" title="Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> <a href="/wiki/Moshe_Sharett" title="Moshe Sharett">Moshe Sharett</a>.</p>
<p>The names <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Children_of_Israel" title="Children of Israel">Children of Israel</a> have historically been used to refer to the biblical <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy)" title="Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)">Kingdom of Israel</a> and the entire Jewish people respectively. The <a href="/wiki/Israel_(name)" title="Israel (name)">name "Israel"</a> (<small><a href="/wiki/Modern_Hebrew" title="Modern Hebrew">Standard</a></small> <i>Yisraʾel</i>, <i>Isrāʾīl</i>; <a href="/wiki/Septuagint" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">Ἰσραήλ</span> <i>Israēl</i>; 'El(God) persists/rules' though, after Hosea 12:4 often interpreted as "struggle with God") in these phrases refers to the patriarch <a href="/wiki/Jacob" title="Jacob">Jacob</a> who, according to the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord. Jacob's twelve sons became the ancestors of the <a href="/wiki/Israelites" title="Israelites">Israelites</a>, also known as the <i>Twelve Tribes of Israel</i> or <i>Children of Israel</i>. Jacob and his sons had lived in <a href="/wiki/Canaan" title="Canaan">Canaan</a> but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations, lasting 430 years, until <a href="/wiki/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a>, a great-great grandson of Jacob, led the Israelites back into Canaan during the "<a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">Exodus</a>". The earliest known archaeological artifact to mention the word "Israel" is the <a href="/wiki/Merneptah_Stele" title="Merneptah Stele">Merneptah Stele</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> (dated to the late 13th century BCE).</p>
<p>The area is also known as the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Land" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a>, being holy for all <a href="/wiki/Abrahamic_religions" title="Abrahamic religions">Abrahamic religions</a> including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the <a href="/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>.

<p>The notion of the "<a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>", known in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hebrew" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> as <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, has been important and sacred to the Jewish people since Biblical times. According to the <a href="/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>, God <a href="/wiki/Promised_Land" title="Promised Land">promised the land</a> to the three <a href="/wiki/Patriarchs_(Bible)" title="Patriarchs (Bible)">Patriarchs</a> of the Jewish people. On the basis of scripture, the period of the three Patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millennium BCE, and the first <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy)" title="Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)">Kingdom of Israel</a> was established around the 11th century BCE. Subsequent <a href="/wiki/History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah" title="History of ancient Israel and Judah">Israelite kingdoms and states</a> ruled intermittently over the next four hundred years, and are known from various extra-biblical sources.</p>
<p>The first record of the name Israel (as <i><span lang="egy-Latn">ysrỉꜣr</span></i>) occurs in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Merneptah_stele" title="Merneptah stele">Merneptah stele</a>, erected for Egyptian Pharaoh <a href="/wiki/Merneptah" title="Merneptah">Merneptah</a> c. 1209 BCE, "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not." This "Israel" was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands, well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their <a href="/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a>, but an ethnic group rather than an organised state; Ancestors of the Israelites may have included <a href="/wiki/Semitic_people" title="Semitic people">Semites</a> native to <a href="/wiki/Canaan" title="Canaan">Canaan</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sea_Peoples" title="Sea Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>. McNutt says, "It is probably safe to assume that sometime during <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> a population began to identify itself as 'Israelite'", differentiating itself from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canaanites" title="Canaanites">Canaanites</a> through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage, an emphasis on family history and genealogy, and religion.</p>
<p>Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400, which lived by farming and herding, and were largely self-sufficient; economic interchange was prevalent. Writing was known and available for recording, even in small sites. The archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres, but with more limited resources and a small population. Modern scholars see Israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of Canaan.</p>

<p>Around 930 BCE, the kingdom split into a southern <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah" title="Kingdom of Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> and a northern <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria)" title="Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)">Kingdom of Israel</a>. From the middle of the 8th century BCE Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_empire" title="Neo-Assyrian empire">neo-Assyrian empire</a>. Under <a href="/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III" title="Tiglath-Pileser III">Tiglath-Pileser III</a> it first split Israel's territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722 BCE). An Israelite revolt (724–722 BCE) was crushed after the siege and capture of <a href="/wiki/Samaria" title="Samaria">Samaria</a> by the Assyrian king <a href="/wiki/Sargon_II" title="Sargon II">Sargon II</a>. Sargon's son, <a href="/wiki/Sennacherib" title="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a>, tried and failed to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sennacherib%27s_campaign_in_Judah" title="Sennacherib's campaign in Judah">conquer</a> Judah. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taylor_prism" title="Taylor prism">Assyrian records</a> say he leveled 46 walled cities and besieged Jerusalem, leaving after receiving extensive tribute.</p>
<p>In 586 BCE King <a href="/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II" title="Nebuchadnezzar II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> of <a href="/wiki/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a> <a href="/wiki/Jewish%E2%80%93Babylonian_war" title="Jewish–Babylonian war">conquered</a> Judah. According to the Hebrew Bible, he destroyed <a href="/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple" title="Solomon's Temple">Solomon's Temple</a> and <a href="/wiki/Babylonian_captivity" title="Babylonian captivity">exiled</a> the Jews to Babylon. The defeat was also recorded by the Babylonians (see the <a href="/wiki/Babylonian_Chronicles" title="Babylonian Chronicles">Babylonian Chronicles</a>). In 538 BCE, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cyrus_(Bible)" title="Cyrus (Bible)">Cyrus the Great</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Persia" title="Persia">Persia</a> conquered Babylon and took over its empire. Cyrus issued a proclamation granting subjugated nations (including the people of Judah) religious freedom (for the original text, which corroborates the biblical narrative only in very broad terms, see the <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder" title="Cyrus Cylinder">Cyrus Cylinder</a>). According to the Hebrew Bible 50,000 Judeans, led by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zerubabel" title="Zerubabel">Zerubabel</a>, returned to Judah and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Temple_of_Jerusalem" title="Second Temple of Jerusalem">rebuilt the temple</a>. A second group of 5,000, led by <a href="/wiki/Ezra" title="Ezra">Ezra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nehemiah" title="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a>, returned to Judah in 456 BCE although non-Jews wrote to Cyrus to try to prevent their return.</p>

<p>With successive <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire" title="Achaemenid Empire">Persian rule</a>, the region, divided between Syria-Coele province and later the autonomous <a href="/wiki/Yehud_Medinata" title="Yehud Medinata">Yehud Medinata</a>, was gradually developing back into urban society, largely dominated by Judeans. The <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic_Greece" title="Hellenistic Greece">Greek</a> conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest. Incorporated into Ptolemaic and finally Seleucid Empires, the southern Levant was heavily <a href="/wiki/Hellenization" title="Hellenization">hellenized</a>, building the tensions between Judeans and Greeks. The conflict erupted in 167 BCE with the <a href="/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt" title="Maccabean Revolt">Maccabean Revolt</a>, which succeeded in establishing an independent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hasmonean_Kingdom" title="Hasmonean Kingdom">Hasmonean Kingdom</a> in Judah, which later expanded over much of modern Israel, as the Seleucids gradually lost control in the region.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> invaded the region in 63 BCE, first taking control of <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and then intervening in the Hasmonean civil war. The struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian factions in Judea eventually led to the installation of <a href="/wiki/Herod_the_Great" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great</a> and consolidation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herodian_Kingdom" title="Herodian Kingdom">Herodian Kingdom</a> as a vassal Judean state of Rome.</p>
<p>With the decline of Herodians, Judea, transformed into a Roman province, became the site of a violent struggle of <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a> against Greco-Romans, culminating in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish-Roman_Wars" title="Jewish-Roman Wars">Jewish-Roman Wars</a>, ending in wide-scale destruction, expulsions, and genocide. Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the <a href="/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt" title="Bar Kokhba revolt">Bar Kokhba revolt</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in 132 CE. Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence and <a href="/wiki/Galilee" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> became its religious center. The <a href="/wiki/Mishnah" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> and part of the <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud" title="Jerusalem Talmud">Talmud</a>, central Jewish texts, were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem. The region came to be populated predominantly by Greco-Romans on the coast and Samaritans in the hill-country. Christianity was gradually evolving over Roman paganism, when the area stood under Byzantine rule. Through the 5th and 6th centuries, the dramatic events of the repeated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Samaritan_revolts" title="Samaritan revolts">Samaritan revolts</a> reshaped the land, with massive destruction to Byzantine Christian and Samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population.

<p>In 634–641 CE, the region, including Jerusalem, was <a href="/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant" title="Muslim conquest of the Levant">conquered</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Arabs" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> who had just recently adopted <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>. It remained under Muslim control for the next 1,300 years under various dynasties.

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1099)" title="Siege of Jerusalem (1099)">siege of Jerusalem</a> by the <a href="/wiki/First_Crusade" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> in 1099, the Jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crusaders" title="Crusaders">Crusaders</a>. When the city fell, about 60,000 people were massacred, including 6,000 Jews seeking refuge in a synagogue. At this time, a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state, there were Jewish communities all over the country. Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem, <a href="/wiki/Tiberias" title="Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ramla" title="Ramla">Ramleh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ashkelon" title="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Caesarea" title="Caesarea">Caesarea</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gaza_City" title="Gaza City">Gaza</a>. According to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Albert_of_Aachen" title="Albert of Aachen">Albert of Aachen</a>, the Jewish residents of Haifa were the main fighting force of the city, and "mixed with Saracen [Fatimid] troops", they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the Crusader fleet and land army. However, <a href="/wiki/Joshua_Prawer" title="Joshua Prawer">Joshua Prawer</a> expressed doubt over the story, noting that Albert did not attend the Crusades and that such a prominent role for the Jews is not mentioned by any other source.</p>

<p>In 1165 <a href="/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> visited Jerusalem and prayed on the Temple Mount, in the "great, holy house". In 1141 the Spanish-Jewish poet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yehuda_Halevi" title="Yehuda Halevi">Yehuda Halevi</a> issued a call for Jews to migrate to the Land of Israel, a journey he undertook himself. In 1187 Sultan <a href="/wiki/Saladin" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, founder of the <a href="/wiki/Ayyubid_dynasty" title="Ayyubid dynasty">Ayyubid dynasty</a>, defeated the Crusaders in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hattin" title="Battle of Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a> and subsequently captured Jerusalem and almost all of Palestine. In time, Saladin issued a proclamation inviting Jews to return and settle in Jerusalem, and according to <a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Alharizi" title="Yehuda Alharizi">Judah al-Harizi</a>, they did: "From the day the Arabs took Jerusalem, the Israelites inhabited it." Al-Harizi compared Saladin's decree allowing Jews to re-establish themselves in Jerusalem to the one issued by the Persian king <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a> over 1,600 years earlier.</p>
<p>In 1211, the Jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from France and England, among them Rabbi <a href="/wiki/Samson_ben_Abraham_of_Sens" title="Samson ben Abraham of Sens">Samson ben Abraham of Sens</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nachmanides" title="Nachmanides">Nachmanides</a>, the 13th-century Spanish rabbi and recognised leader of Jewry greatly praised the land of Israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all Jews. He wrote "If the gentiles wish to make peace, we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms; but as for the land, we shall not leave it in their hands, nor in the hands of any nation, not in any generation."</p>
<p>In 1260, control passed to the <a href="/wiki/Mamluk_Sultanate_(Cairo)" title="Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)">Mamluk sultans of Egypt</a>. The country was located between the two centres of Mamluk power, Cairo and Damascus, and only saw some development along the postal road connecting the two cities. Jerusalem, although left without the protection of any <a href="/wiki/Walls_of_Jerusalem" title="Walls of Jerusalem">city walls</a> since 1219, also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> compound (the <a href="/wiki/Temple_Mount" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a>). In 1266 the Mamluk Sultan <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baybars" title="Baybars">Baybars</a> converted the <a href="/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs" title="Cave of the Patriarchs">Cave of the Patriarchs</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hebron" title="Hebron">Hebron</a> into an exclusive Islamic sanctuary and banned Christians and Jews from entering, which previously would be able to enter it for a fee. The ban remained in place until Israel took control of the building in 1967.</p>

<p>In 1470, Isaac b. Meir Latif arrived from <a href="/wiki/Ancona" title="Ancona">Ancona</a> and counted 150 Jewish families in Jerusalem. Thanks to <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Saragossi" title="Joseph Saragossi">Joseph Saragossi</a> who had arrived in the closing years of the 15th century, Safed and its environs had developed into the largest concentration of Jews in Palestine. With the help of the Sephardic <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a> from Spain, the Jewish population had increased to 10,000 by the early 16th century.</p>
<p>In 1516, the region was conquered by the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>; it remained under <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Syria" title="Ottoman Syria">Turkish rule</a> until the end of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_World_War" title="First World War">First World War</a>, when Britain defeated the Ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former Ottoman Syria.

<p>Since the existence of the earliest <a href="/wiki/Jewish_diaspora" title="Jewish diaspora">Jewish diaspora</a>, many Jews have aspired to return to "Zion" and the "Land of Israel", though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute.

After the Jews were <a href="/wiki/Alhambra_Decree" title="Alhambra Decree">expelled from Spain</a> in 1492, some communities settled in Palestine.

<p>The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled Palestine, known as the <a href="/wiki/First_Aliyah" title="First Aliyah">First Aliyah</a>, began in 1881, as Jews fled <a href="/wiki/Pogrom#Pogroms_against_Jews" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a> in Eastern Europe. Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Austria%E2%80%93Hungary" title="Austria–Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> journalist <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Herzl" title="Theodor Herzl">Theodor Herzl</a> is credited with founding political <a href="/wiki/Zionism" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish_Question" title="Jewish Question">Jewish Question</a> of the European states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time. In 1896, Herzl published <i><a href="/wiki/Der_Judenstaat" title="Der Judenstaat">Der Judenstaat</a></i> (<i>The State of the Jews</i>), offering his vision of a future Jewish state; the following year he presided over the first <a href="/wiki/World_Zionist_Congress" title="World Zionist Congress">Zionist Congress</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Second_Aliyah" title="Second Aliyah">Second Aliyah</a> (1904–14), began after the <a href="/wiki/Kishinev_pogrom" title="Kishinev pogrom">Kishinev pogrom</a>; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half of them left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Jews</a>, although the Second Aliyah included <a href="/wiki/Labor_Zionism" title="Labor Zionism">socialist</a> groups who established the <i><a href="/wiki/Kibbutz" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a></i> movement. During World War I, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs" title="Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs">British Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Balfour" title="Arthur Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a> sent the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917" title="Balfour Declaration of 1917">Balfour Declaration of 1917</a> to <a href="/wiki/Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothschild" title="Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild">Baron Rothschild</a> (Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild), a leader of the British Jewish community, that stated that Britain intended for the creation of a Jewish "national home" within the Palestinian Mandate.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Legion" title="Jewish Legion">Jewish Legion</a>, a group primarily of Zionist volunteers, assisted, in 1918, in the British conquest of Palestine. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1920_Palestine_riots" title="1920 Palestine riots">1920 Palestine riots</a> and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the <a href="/wiki/Haganah" title="Haganah">Haganah</a> (meaning "The Defense" in Hebrew), from which the <a href="/wiki/Irgun" title="Irgun">Irgun</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lehi_(group)" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi</a>, or <i>Stern Gang</i>, paramilitary groups later split off. In 1922, the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> granted Britain a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine" title="British Mandate for Palestine">mandate over Palestine</a> under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews, and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians. The population of the area at this time was predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about 11%, and Arab Christians at about 9.5% of the population.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Third_Aliyah" title="Third Aliyah">Third</a> (1919–23) and <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Aliyah" title="Fourth Aliyah">Fourth Aliyahs</a> (1924–29) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine. Finally, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hitler%27s_rise_to_power" title="Hitler's rise to power">rise of Nazism</a> and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Aliyah" title="Fifth Aliyah">Fifth Aliyah</a>, with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the <a href="/wiki/1936%E2%80%9339_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine" title="1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine">Arab revolt of 1936–39</a> during which the British Mandate authorities alongside the Zionist militias of <a href="/wiki/Haganah" title="Haganah">Haganah</a> and <a href="/wiki/Irgun" title="Irgun">Irgun</a> killed 5,032 Arabs and wounded 14,760, resulting in over ten percent of the adult male <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palestinian_Arab" title="Palestinian Arab">Palestinian Arab</a> population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the <a href="/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939" title="White Paper of 1939">White Paper of 1939</a>. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>, a clandestine movement known as <a href="/wiki/Aliyah_Bet" title="Aliyah Bet">Aliyah Bet</a> was organized to bring Jews to Palestine.

<p>After World War II, Britain found itself in intense <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Palestine" title="Jewish insurgency in Palestine">conflict</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Yishuv" title="Yishuv">Jewish community</a> over Jewish immigration limits, as well as continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels.

At the same time, hundreds of thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in Europe. The Yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to Palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps in <a href="/wiki/Atlit_detainee_camp" title="Atlit detainee camp">Atlit</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cyprus_internment_camps" title="Cyprus internment camps">Cyprus</a> by the British.</p>
<p>On July 22, 1946, <a href="/wiki/Irgun" title="Irgun">Irgun</a> <a href="/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing" title="King David Hotel bombing">attacked</a> the British administrative headquarters for Palestine, which was housed in the southern wing of the <a href="/wiki/King_David_Hotel" title="King David Hotel">King David Hotel</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured. The hotel was the site of the central offices of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandatory</a> authorities of Palestine, principally the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in <a href="/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine" title="Mandatory Palestine">Palestine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan" title="Emirate of Transjordan">Transjordan</a>. The attack initially had the approval of the <a href="/wiki/Haganah" title="Haganah">Haganah</a> (the principal Jewish paramilitary group in Palestine). It was conceived as a response to <a href="/wiki/Operation_Agatha" title="Operation Agatha">Operation Agatha</a> (a series of widespread raids, including one on the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel" title="Jewish Agency for Israel">Jewish Agency</a>, conducted by the British authorities) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era (1920–1948). <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Hoffman" title="Bruce Hoffman">Bruce Hoffman</a> characterized as one of the "most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century". In 1947, the British government announced it would withdraw from <a href="/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine" title="Mandatory Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a>, stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews.</p>
<p>On 15 May 1947, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Assembly_of_the_United_Nations" title="General Assembly of the United Nations">General Assembly</a> of the newly formed <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> resolved that a committee, <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Committee_on_Palestine" title="United Nations Special Committee on Palestine">United Nations Special Committee on Palestine</a> (UNSCOP), be created "to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine". In the Report of the Committee dated 3 September 1947 to the UN General Assembly, the majority of the Committee in Chapter VI proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem ... the last to be under an International Trusteeship System". On 29 November 1947, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> adopted a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine" title="United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine">resolution</a> recommending the adoption and implementation of the <i>Plan of Partition with Economic Union</i> as Resolution 181 (II). The Plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the Committee in the Report of 3 September 1947. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency" title="Jewish Agency">Jewish Agency</a>, which was the recognized representative of the Jewish community, accepted the plan. The <a href="/wiki/Arab_League" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arab_Higher_Committee" title="Arab Higher Committee">Arab Higher Committee</a> of Palestine rejected it, and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.</p>
<p>On the following day, 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and Arab gangs began attacking Jewish targets. The Jews were initially on the defensive as <a href="/wiki/1947%E2%80%9348_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine" title="1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine">civil war</a> broke out, but in early April 1948 moved onto the offensive. The Arab Palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled.</p>

<p>On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, <a href="/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion" title="David Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a>, the head of the Jewish Agency, <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence" title="Israeli Declaration of Independence">declared</a> "the establishment of a Jewish state in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eretz-Israel" title="Eretz-Israel">Eretz-Israel</a>, to be known as the State of Israel". The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term <i>Eretz-Israel</i> ("<a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>").</p>
<p>The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been British Mandatory Palestine, launching the <a href="/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War" title="1948 Arab–Israeli War">1948 Arab–Israeli War</a>; Contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Sudan joined the war. The apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state at inception, and some Arab leaders talked about driving the Jews into the sea. According to <a href="/wiki/Benny_Morris" title="Benny Morris">Benny Morris</a>, Jews felt that the invading Arab armies aimed to slaughter the Jews. The Arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed.</p>

<p>After a year of fighting, a <a href="/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements" title="1949 Armistice Agreements">ceasefire was declared</a> and temporary borders, known as the <a href="/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)" title="Green Line (Israel)">Green Line</a>, were established. <a href="/wiki/Jordanian_occupation_of_the_West_Bank" title="Jordanian occupation of the West Bank">Jordan annexed</a> what became known as the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, including <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" title="East Jerusalem">East Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_Egypt" title="Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt">Egypt took control</a> of the Gaza Strip.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_years_of_the_State_of_Israel">First years of the State of Israel</span></h3>
<p>Israel was admitted as a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_273" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273">member of the United Nations</a> by majority vote on 11 May 1949. On 1949 both Israel and Jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the British acted as a brake on the Jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging British interests in Egypt.</p>
<p>In the early years of the state, the <a href="/wiki/Labor_Zionism" title="Labor Zionism">Labor Zionist</a> movement led by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion dominated Israeli politics. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kibbutzim" title="Kibbutzim">Kibbutzim</a>, or collective farming communities, played a pivotal role in establishing the new state.</p>
<p>Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non-government sponsored <a href="/wiki/Mossad_LeAliyah_Bet" title="Mossad LeAliyah Bet">Mossad LeAliyah Bet</a> ("Institution for Illegal Immigration"). Both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation, but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, where the lives of Jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult. <a href="/wiki/Mossad_LeAliyah_Bet" title="Mossad LeAliyah Bet">Mossad LeAliyah Bet</a> continued to take part in immigration efforts until its disbanding in 1953. <a href="/wiki/Aliyah#Early_statehood_.281948.E2.80.931960.29" title="Aliyah">An influx</a> of <a href="/wiki/Aftermath_of_the_Holocaust" title="Aftermath of the Holocaust">Holocaust survivors</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries" title="Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries">Jews from Arab and Muslim lands</a> immigrated to Israel during the first 3 years and the number of Jews increased from 700,000 to 1,400,000, many of whom faced persecution in their original countries. The immigration was in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/One_Million_Plan" title="One Million Plan">One Million Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Consequently, the population of Israel rose from 800,000 to two million between 1948 and 1958. Between 1948 and 1970, approximately 1,150,000 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel. The immigrants came to Israel for differing reasons. Some believed in a Zionist ideology, while others moved to escape persecution. There were others that did it for the promise of a better life in Israel and a small number that were expelled from their homelands, such as British and French Jews in Egypt after the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Crisis" title="Suez Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as <i><a href="/wiki/Ma%27abarot" title="Ma'abarot">ma'abarot</a></i>; by 1952, over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities. During this period, food, clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Austerity_in_Israel" title="Austerity in Israel">Austerity Period</a>. The need to solve the crisis led Ben-Gurion to sign a <a href="/wiki/Reparations_Agreement_between_Israel_and_West_Germany" title="Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany">reparations agreement with West Germany</a> that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust.</p>
<p>In 1950 Egypt closed the Suez Canal to Israeli shipping and tensions mounted as armed clashes took place along Israel's borders. During the 1950s, Israel was frequently <a href="/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967" title="List of attacks against Israeli civilians before 1967">attacked</a> by <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen" title="Palestinian fedayeen">Palestinian fedayeen</a>, nearly always against civilians, mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, leading to several Israeli <a href="/wiki/Reprisal_operations" title="Reprisal operations">counter-raids</a>.

The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and <a href="/wiki/Straits_of_Tiran" title="Straits of Tiran">Straits of Tiran</a> to Israeli shipping, together with the growing amount of Fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population, and recent Arab grave and threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt. Israel joined <a href="/wiki/Protocol_of_S%C3%A8vres" title="Protocol of Sèvres">a secret alliance</a> with Great Britain and France and overran the <a href="/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula" title="Sinai Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a> but was pressured to withdraw by the United Nations in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> via the Straits of Tiran and the Canal. The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration.</p>

<p>The refugees were often treated differently according to where they had come from. Jews of European background were treated more favorably than Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former, with the result that Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying in <a href="/wiki/Ma%27abarot" title="Ma'abarot">transit camps</a> for longer. Tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Israel captured Nazi war criminal <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann" title="Adolf Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial. The trial had a major impact on public awareness of the Holocaust. Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction by an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israeli_judicial_system" title="Israeli judicial system">Israeli civilian court</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1964, Arab countries, concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_River" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a> into the coastal plain, had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources, provoking <a href="/wiki/War_over_Water_(Jordan_river)" title="War over Water (Jordan river)">tensions</a> between Israel on the one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Arab_nationalism" title="Arab nationalism">Arab nationalists</a> led by Egyptian President <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> refused to recognize Israel, and called for its destruction. By 1966, Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces. In May 1967, Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel, expelled <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force" title="United Nations Emergency Force">UN peacekeepers</a>, stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957, and blocked Israel's access to the Red Sea. Other Arab states mobilized their forces. Israel reiterated that these actions were a <i><a href="/wiki/Casus_belli" title="Casus belli">casus belli</a></i>. On 5 June 1967, Israel launched a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against Egypt. Jordan, Syria and Iraq responded and attacked Israel. In a <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank, defeated Egypt and captured the Gaza Strip and <a href="/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula" title="Sinai Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>, and defeated Syria and captured the <a href="/wiki/Golan_Heights" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a>. Jerusalem's boundaries were enlarged, incorporating <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" title="East Jerusalem">East Jerusalem</a>, and the 1949 <a href="/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)" title="Green Line (Israel)">Green Line</a> became the administrative boundary between Israel and the <a href="/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories" title="Israeli-occupied territories">occupied territories</a>.</p>
<p>Following the 1967 war and the <a href="/wiki/Khartoum_Resolution" title="Khartoum Resolution">"three nos"</a> resolution of the Arab League, during the 1967–1970 <a href="/wiki/War_of_Attrition" title="War of Attrition">War of Attrition</a> Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai, and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories, in Israel proper, and around the world. Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palestinian_Liberation_Organization" title="Palestinian Liberation Organization">Palestinian Liberation Organization</a> (PLO), established in 1964, which initially committed itself to "armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen" title="Palestinian fedayeen">Palestinian groups</a> launched a <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_political_violence" title="Palestinian political violence">wave of attacks</a> against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world, including <a href="/wiki/Munich_massacre" title="Munich massacre">a massacre of Israeli athletes</a> at the <a href="/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics" title="1972 Summer Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a> in Munich. The Israeli government responded with an <a href="/wiki/Operation_Wrath_of_God" title="Operation Wrath of God">assassination campaign</a> against the organizers of the massacre, a <a href="/wiki/1972_Israeli_air_raid_in_Syria_and_Lebanon" title="1972 Israeli air raid in Syria and Lebanon">bombing</a> and a <a href="/wiki/1973_Israeli_raid_on_Lebanon" title="1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon">raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon</a>.</p>
<p>On 6 October 1973, as Jews were observing <a href="/wiki/Yom_Kippur" title="Yom Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>, the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, that opened the <a href="/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War" title="Yom Kippur War">Yom Kippur War</a>. The war ended on 26 October with Israel successfully repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but having suffered over 2,500 soldiers killed in a war which collectively took 10–35,000 lives in just 20 days. An <a href="/wiki/Agranat_Commission" title="Agranat Commission">internal inquiry</a> exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war, but public anger forced Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Golda_Meir" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a> to resign.</p>

<p>In July 1976 an airliner was hijacked during its flight to Tel Aviv by Palestinian guerrillas and landed at <a href="/wiki/Entebbe_International_Airport" title="Entebbe International Airport">Entebbe</a>, Uganda. Israeli commandos carried out <a href="/wiki/Operation_Entebbe" title="Operation Entebbe">an operation</a> in which 102 out of 106 Israeli hostages were successfully rescued.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Israeli_legislative_election,_1977" title="Israeli legislative election, 1977">1977 Knesset elections</a> marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as <a href="/wiki/Menachem_Begin" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Likud" title="Likud">Likud</a> party took control from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_Party_(Israel)" title="Labor Party (Israel)">Labor Party</a>. Later that year, Egyptian President <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anwar_El_Sadat" title="Anwar El Sadat">Anwar El Sadat</a> made a trip to Israel and spoke before the <a href="/wiki/Knesset" title="Knesset">Knesset</a> in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state. In the two years that followed, Sadat and Begin signed the <a href="/wiki/Camp_David_Accords" title="Camp David Accords">Camp David Accords</a> (1978) and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Egypt_Peace_Treaty" title="Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty">Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty</a> (1979). In return, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War in 1967, and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coastal_Road_Massacre" title="Coastal Road Massacre">Coastal Road Massacre</a>. Israel responded by launching an <a href="/wiki/1978_South_Lebanon_conflict" title="1978 South Lebanon conflict">invasion of southern Lebanon</a> to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River. Most PLO fighters withdrew, but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over. The PLO soon resumed its <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_insurgency_in_South_Lebanon" title="Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon">policy of attacks</a> against Israel. In the next few years, the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Begin's government provided incentives for Israelis to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israeli_settlements" title="Israeli settlements">settle</a> in the occupied West Bank, increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area. The <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_Law" title="Jerusalem Law">Basic Law: Jerusalem, the Capital of Israel</a>, passed in 1980, was believed by some to reaffirm Israel's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Security_Council_Resolution_478" title="UN Security Council Resolution 478">reignited international controversy</a> over the <a href="/wiki/Positions_on_Jerusalem" title="Positions on Jerusalem">status of the city</a>. No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein. The position of the majority of UN member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by Israel to settle its citizens in the West Bank, and impose its laws and administration on East Jerusalem, are illegal and have no validity. In 1981 Israel <a href="/wiki/Golan_Heights_Law" title="Golan Heights Law">annexed</a> the <a href="/wiki/Golan_Heights" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a>, although annexation was not recognized internationally.</p>
<p>On 7 June 1981, the Israeli air force <a href="/wiki/Operation_Opera" title="Operation Opera">destroyed</a> Iraq's sole <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Osirak" title="Osirak">nuclear reactor</a>, in order to impede Iraq's nuclear weapons program. The reactor was under construction just outside Baghdad. Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982, Israel <a href="/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War" title="1982 Lebanon War">invaded</a> Lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel. In the first six days of fighting, the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians. An Israeli government inquiry – the <a href="/wiki/Kahan_Commission" title="Kahan Commission">Kahan Commission</a> – would later hold Begin, Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the <a href="/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre" title="Sabra and Shatila massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a>. In 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by <a href="/wiki/Operation_Wooden_Leg" title="Operation Wooden Leg">bombing</a> the PLO headquarters in Tunis.

<p>Israel's ethnic diversity expanded in the 1980s and 1990s due to immigration. Several waves of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethiopian_Jews" title="Ethiopian Jews">Ethiopian Jews</a> <a href="/wiki/Operation_Solomon" title="Operation Solomon">immigrated</a> to Israel in the 1980s and 1990s, while between 1990 and 1994, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aliyah_from_the_Commonwealth_of_Independent_States_in_the_1990s" title="Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s">Russian immigration</a> to Israel increased Israel's population by twelve percent.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/First_Intifada" title="First Intifada">First Intifada</a>, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule, broke out in 1987, with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Over the following six years, the Intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation. More than a thousand people were killed in the violence. During the 1991 <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>, the PLO supported <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and Iraqi Scud <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War#Iraqi_missile_strikes_on_Israel_and_Saudi_Arabia" title="Gulf War">missile attacks against Israel</a>. Despite public outrage, Israel heeded US calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war.</p>

<p>In 1992, <a href="/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> became Prime Minister following <a href="/wiki/Israeli_legislative_election,_1992" title="Israeli legislative election, 1992">an election</a> in which his party called for compromise with Israel's neighbors. The following year, <a href="/wiki/Shimon_Peres" title="Shimon Peres">Shimon Peres</a> on behalf of Israel, and <a href="/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas" title="Mahmoud Abbas">Mahmoud Abbas</a> for the PLO, signed the <a href="/wiki/Oslo_Accords" title="Oslo Accords">Oslo Accords</a>, which gave the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority" title="Palestinian National Authority">Palestinian National Authority</a> the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The PLO also <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel_%E2%80%93_Palestine_Liberation_Organization_letters_of_recognition" title="Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition">recognized Israel's right to exist</a> and pledged an end to terrorism. In 1994, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Jordan_Treaty_of_Peace" title="Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace">Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace</a> was signed, making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel. Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli <a href="/wiki/Israeli_settlement" title="Israeli settlement">settlements</a> and <a href="/wiki/Israeli_checkpoint" title="Israeli checkpoint">checkpoints</a>, and the deterioration of economic conditions. Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Hamas_suicide_attacks" title="List of Hamas suicide attacks">Palestinian suicide attacks</a>. Finally, while leaving a peace rally in November 1995, <a href="/wiki/Assassination_of_Yitzhak_Rabin" title="Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated</a> by a far-right-wing Jew who opposed the Accords.</p>
<p>At the end of the 1990s, Israel, under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu" title="Benjamin Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, withdrew from <a href="/wiki/Hebron" title="Hebron">Hebron</a>, and signed the <a href="/wiki/Wye_River_Memorandum" title="Wye River Memorandum">Wye River Memorandum</a>, giving greater control to the Palestinian National Authority. <a href="/wiki/Ehud_Barak" title="Ehud Barak">Ehud Barak</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israeli_prime_ministerial_election,_1999" title="Israeli prime ministerial election, 1999">elected Prime Minister in 1999</a>, began the new millennium by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1982%E2%80%932000)#2000:_Israeli_withdrawal" title="South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)">withdrawing forces from Southern Lebanon</a> and conducting negotiations with Palestinian Authority Chairman <a href="/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> and U.S. President Bill Clinton at the <a href="/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit" title="2000 Camp David Summit">2000 Camp David Summit</a>. During the summit, Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palestinian_state" title="Palestinian state">Palestinian state</a>. The proposed state included the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90% of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital, although some argue that the plan was to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the West Bank into three blocs, which the Palestinian delegation likened to South African "<a href="/wiki/Bantustan" title="Bantustan">bantustans</a>", a loaded word that was disputed by the Israeli and American negotiators. Each side blamed the other for the <a href="/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit#Responsibility_for_failure" title="2000 Camp David Summit">failure of the talks</a>.</p>

<p>After the collapse of the talks and a controversial visit by <a href="/wiki/Likud" title="Likud">Likud</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Ariel_Sharon" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Temple_Mount" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Intifada" title="Second Intifada">Second Intifada</a> began. Some commentators contend that the uprising was pre-planned by Yasser Arafat due to the collapse of peace talks. Sharon became prime minister in a <a href="/wiki/Israeli_prime_ministerial_election,_2001" title="Israeli prime ministerial election, 2001">2001 special election</a>. During his tenure, Sharon carried out his plan to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan" title="Israel's unilateral disengagement plan">unilaterally withdraw</a> from the Gaza Strip and also spearheaded the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>, ending the Intifada. By this time 1,100 Israelis had been killed, mostly in suicide bombings. The Palestinian fatalities, by 30 April 2008, reached 4,745 killed by Israeli security forces, 44 killed by Israeli civilians, and 577 killed by Palestinians.</p>
<p>In July 2006, a <a href="/wiki/Hezbollah" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> artillery assault on Israel's northern border communities and a cross-border abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month-long <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Lebanon_War" title="Second Lebanon War">Second Lebanon War</a>. On 6 September 2007, the Israeli Air Force <a href="/wiki/Operation_Orchard" title="Operation Orchard">destroyed</a> a nuclear reactor in Syria. In May 2008, Israel confirmed it had been discussing a peace treaty with Syria for a year, with Turkey as a go-between. However, at the end of the year, Israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between <a href="/wiki/Hamas" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> and Israel collapsed. The <a href="/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309)" title="Gaza War (2008–09)">Gaza War</a> lasted three weeks and ended after Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire. Hamas announced its own ceasefire, with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings. Despite neither the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel" title="Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel">rocket launchings</a> nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped, the fragile ceasefire remained in order. In what Israel described as a response to more than a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities, Israel began an <a href="/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense" title="Operation Pillar of Defense">operation</a> in Gaza on 14 November 2012, lasting eight days. Israel started another <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Operation_Protective_Edge" title="Operation Protective Edge">operation</a> in Gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by Hamas in July 2014.</p>

<p>Israel is at the eastern end of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, bounded by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest.

Further south is the <a href="/wiki/Arabah" title="Arabah">Arabah</a>, ending with the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Aqaba" title="Gulf of Aqaba">Gulf of Eilat</a>, part of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. Unique to Israel and the <a href="/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula" title="Sinai Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a> are <a href="/wiki/Makhtesh" title="Makhtesh">makhteshim</a>, or erosion cirques. The largest makhtesh in the world is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ramon_Crater" title="Ramon Crater">Ramon Crater</a> in the Negev, which measures 40 by 8 kilometers (25 by 5 mi). A report on the environmental status of the Mediterranean basin states that Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tectonics_and_seismicity">Tectonics and seismicity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Geography_of_Israel#Seismic_activity" title="Geography of Israel">Geography of Israel § Seismic activity</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Rift_Valley" title="Jordan Rift Valley">Jordan Rift Valley</a> is the result of tectonic movements within the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Sea_Transform" title="Dead Sea Transform">Dead Sea Transform</a> (DSF) fault system. The DSF forms the <a href="/wiki/Transform_fault" title="Transform fault">transform boundary</a> between the <a href="/wiki/African_Plate" title="African Plate">African Plate</a> to the west and the <a href="/wiki/Arabian_Plate" title="Arabian Plate">Arabian Plate</a> to the east. The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate, while the Galilee, West Bank, Coastal Plain, and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate. This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region. The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly, for instance during the last two major <a href="/wiki/Geography_of_Israel#Seismic_activity" title="Geography of Israel">earthquakes</a> along this structure in <a href="/wiki/749_Galilee_earthquake" title="749 Galilee earthquake">749</a> and 1033. The deficit in <a href="/wiki/Fault_(geology)#Slip.2C_heave.2C_throw" title="Fault (geology)">slip</a> that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of <a href="/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale" title="Moment magnitude scale">Mw</a>~7.4.</p>
<p>The most catastrophic earthquakes we know of occurred in 31 BCE, 363, 749, and 1033 CE, that is every ca. 400 years on average. Destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years. While stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquake-safe, as of 2007 the majority of the buildings in Israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were "expected to collapse" if exposed to a strong quake. Given the fragile political situation of the Middle East region and the presence there of major holy sites, a quake reaching magnitude 7 on the Richter scale could have dire consequences for world peace.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>

<p>Temperatures in Israel vary widely, especially during the winter. Coastal areas, such as those of <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> and <a href="/wiki/Haifa" title="Haifa">Haifa</a>, have a typical <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_climate" title="Mediterranean climate">Mediterranean climate</a> with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers. The area of <a href="/wiki/Beersheba" title="Beersheba">Beersheba</a> and the Northern Negev has a <a href="/wiki/Semi-arid_climate" title="Semi-arid climate">semi-arid climate</a> with hot summers, cool winters and fewer rainy days than the Mediterranean climate. The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have <a href="/wiki/Desert_climate" title="Desert climate">desert climate</a> with very hot and dry summers, and mild winters with few days of rain. The highest temperature in the continent of Asia (54.0 °C or 129.2 °F) was recorded in 1942 at <a href="/wiki/Tirat_Zvi" title="Tirat Zvi">Tirat Zvi</a> kibbutz in the northern Jordan river valley.</p>
<p>At the other extreme mountainous regions can be windy, cold, and areas at elevation of 750 meters or more (same elevation as Jerusalem) will usually receive at least one snowfall each year. From May to September, rain in Israel is rare. With scarce water resources, Israel has developed various water-saving technologies, including <a href="/wiki/Drip_irrigation" title="Drip irrigation">drip irrigation</a>. Israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a>, making <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Israel" title="Solar power in Israel">Israel the leading nation in solar energy</a> use per capita (practically every house uses solar panels for water heating).</p>
<p>Four different <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phytogeographic" title="Phytogeographic">phytogeographic</a> regions exist in Israel, due to the country's location between the temperate and the tropical zones, bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east. For this reason the flora and fauna of Israel is extremely diverse. There are 2,867 known species of plants found in Israel. Of these, at least 253 species are <a href="/wiki/List_of_adventive_wild_plants_in_Israel" title="List of adventive wild plants in Israel">introduced</a> and non-native. There are 380 Israeli nature reserves.</p>

<p>In 2016, Israel's population was an estimated 8,541,000 people, of whom 6,388,800 (74.8%) were recorded by the civil government as <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Jews" title="Israeli Jews">Jews</a>. 1,775,400 <a href="/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel" title="Arab citizens of Israel">Arabs</a> comprised 20.8% of the population, while non-Arab Christians and people who have no religion listed in the civil registry made up 4.4%. Over the last decade, large numbers of migrant workers from Romania, Thailand, China, Africa, and South America have settled in Israel. Exact figures are unknown, as many of them are living in the country illegally, but estimates run in the region of 203,000. By June 2012, approximately 60,000 <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigration_from_Africa_to_Israel" title="Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel">African migrants</a> had entered Israel. About 92% of Israelis live in urban areas.</p>
<p>Retention of Israel's population since 1948 is about even or greater, when compared to other countries with mass immigration. Jewish emigration from Israel (called <i><a href="/wiki/Yerida" title="Yerida">yerida</a></i> in Hebrew), primarily to the United States and Canada, is described by demographers as modest, but is often cited by Israeli government ministries as a major threat to Israel's future.</p>
<p>In 2009, over 300,000 Israeli citizens lived in <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> settlements such as <a href="/wiki/Ma%27ale_Adumim" title="Ma'ale Adumim">Ma'ale Adumim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ariel_(city)" title="Ariel (city)">Ariel</a>, including settlements that predated the establishment of the State of Israel and which were re-established after the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, in cities such as <a href="/wiki/Hebron" title="Hebron">Hebron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gush_Etzion" title="Gush Etzion">Gush Etzion</a>. In 2011, there were 250,000 Jews living in <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" title="East Jerusalem">East Jerusalem</a>. 20,000 Israelis live in <a href="/wiki/Golan_Heights" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a> settlements. The total number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israeli_settlers" title="Israeli settlers">Israeli settlers</a> is over 500,000 (6.5% of the Israeli population). Approximately 7,800 Israelis lived in settlements in the Gaza Strip, until they were evacuated by the government as part of its 2005 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan" title="Israel's unilateral disengagement plan">disengagement plan</a>.</p>

<p>Israel was established as a homeland for the <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jewish people</a> and is often referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Jewish_state" title="Jewish state">Jewish state</a>. The country's <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Return" title="Law of Return">Law of Return</a> grants all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry the right to <a href="/wiki/Israeli_nationality_law" title="Israeli nationality law">Israeli citizenship</a>. Over three quarters, or 75.5%, of the population are Jews from a <a href="/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions" title="Jewish ethnic divisions">diversity of Jewish backgrounds</a>. Around 4% of Israelis (300,000), ethnically defined as "others", are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_immigration_to_Israel_in_the_1990s" title="Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s">Russian descendants</a> of Jewish origin or family who are not Jewish according to rabbinical law, but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return. Approximately 76% of <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Jews" title="Israeli Jews">Israeli Jews</a> are <a href="/wiki/Sabra_(person)" title="Sabra (person)">born in Israel</a>, 16% are immigrants from Europe and the Americas, and 8% are immigrants from Asia and Africa (including the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arab_World" title="Arab World">Arab World</a>). Jews from Europe and the former Soviet Union and their descendants born in Israel, including <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews" title="Ashkenazi Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>, constitute approximately 50% of Jewish Israelis. <a href="/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries" title="Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries">Jews who left or fled Arab and Muslim countries</a> and their descendants, including both <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mizrahi" title="Mizrahi">Mizrahi</a></i> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sephardi" title="Sephardi">Sephardi</a></i> Jews, form most of the rest of the Jewish population. Jewish intermarriage rates run at over 35% and recent studies suggest that the percentage of Israelis descended from both Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews increases by 0.5 percent every year, with over 25% of school children now originating from both communities.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Languages_of_Israel" title="Languages of Israel">Languages of Israel</a></div>

<p>Israel has two official languages, <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>. Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken every day by the majority of the population. Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority, with Hebrew taught in Arab schools.</p>
<p>As a country of <a href="/wiki/Aliyah" title="Aliyah">immigrants</a>, many languages can be heard on the streets. Due to mass immigration from the former <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aliyah_from_Ethiopia" title="Aliyah from Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> (some 130,000 <a href="/wiki/Beta_Israel" title="Beta Israel">Ethiopian Jews</a> live in Israel), <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amharic" title="Amharic">Amharic</a> are widely spoken. More than one million Russian-speaking immigrants arrived in Israel from the former Soviet Union states between 1990 and 2004. <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> is spoken by around 700,000 Israelis, mostly originating from France and North Africa (see <a href="/wiki/Maghrebi_Jews" title="Maghrebi Jews">Maghrebi Jews</a>). <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> was an official language during the Mandate period; it lost this status after the creation of Israel, but retains a role comparable to that of an official language, as may be seen in road signs and official documents. Many Israelis communicate reasonably well in English, as many television programs are broadcast in English with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subtitles" title="Subtitles">subtitles</a> and the language is taught from the early grades in elementary school. In addition, Israeli universities offer courses in the English language on various subjects.</p>

<p>The religious affiliation of <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Jews" title="Israeli Jews">Israeli Jews</a> varies widely: a social survey for those over the age of 20 indicates that 55% say they are "traditional", while 20% consider themselves "secular Jews", 17% define themselves as "<a href="/wiki/Religious_Zionism" title="Religious Zionism">Religious Zionists</a>"; 8% define themselves as "<a href="/wiki/Haredi_Judaism" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi</a> Jews". Haredi Jews are expected to represent more than 20% of Israel's Jewish population by 2028.</p>

<p>Making up 16% of the population, Muslims constitute Israel's largest religious minority. About 2% of the population is <a href="/wiki/Christianity_in_Israel" title="Christianity in Israel">Christian</a> and 1.5% is <a href="/wiki/Druze" title="Druze">Druze</a>. The Christian population primarily comprises <a href="/wiki/Arab_Christians" title="Arab Christians">Arab Christians</a>, but also includes post-Soviet immigrants, the foreign laborers of multinational origins, and followers of <a href="/wiki/Messianic_Judaism" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic Judaism</a>, considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity.

Out of more than one million immigrants from the former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_immigration_to_Israel_in_the_1990s" title="Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s">Soviet Union</a> in Israel, about 300,000 are considered not Jewish by the Orthodox rabbinate.</p>
<p>The city of <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> is of special importance to Jews, Muslims and Christians as it is the home of sites that are pivotal to their religious beliefs, such as the <a href="/wiki/Old_City_(Jerusalem)" title="Old City (Jerusalem)">Old City</a> that incorporates the <a href="/wiki/Western_Wall" title="Western Wall">Western Wall</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Temple_Mount" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre" title="Church of the Holy Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Israel" title="Education in Israel">Education in Israel</a></div>

<p>Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. The Israeli education system has been praised for various reasons, including its high quality and its major role in spurring Israel's economic development and technological boom. Many international business leaders and organizations such as Microsoft founder <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gates" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> have praised Israel for its high quality of education in helping spur Israel's economic development.</p>
<p>As the Israeli economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment. In 2012, the country ranked second among OECD countries (tied with Japan and after Canada) for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 46 percent compared with the OECD average of 32 percent. In addition, nearly twice as many Israelis aged 55–64 held a higher education degree compared to other OECD countries, with 47 percent holding an academic degree compared with the OECD average of 25%. In 2012, the country ranked third in the world in the number of academic degrees per capita (20 percent of the population).</p>
<p>Israel has a school life expectancy of 15.5 years and a literacy rate of 97.1% according to the United Nations. The State Education Law, passed in 1953, established five types of schools: state secular, state religious, ultra orthodox, communal settlement schools, and Arab schools. The public secular is the largest school group, and is attended by the majority of Jewish and non-Arab pupils in Israel. Most Arabs send their children to schools where Arabic is the language of instruction. Education is <a href="/wiki/Compulsory_education" title="Compulsory education">compulsory</a> in Israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen. Schooling is divided into three tiers – primary school (grades 1–6), <a href="/wiki/Middle_school" title="Middle school">middle school</a> (grades 7–9), and high school (grades 10–12) – culminating with <i><a href="/wiki/Bagrut" title="Bagrut">Bagrut</a></i> matriculation exams. Proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics, the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew language</a>, Hebrew and general literature, the <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English language</a>, history, Biblical scripture and civics is necessary to receive a Bagrut certificate. In Arab, Christian and <a href="/wiki/Druze" title="Druze">Druze</a> schools, the exam on Biblical studies is replaced by an exam on Muslim, Christian or Druze heritage. <a href="/wiki/Maariv" title="Maariv">Maariv</a> have describe the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christian_Arabs" title="Christian Arabs">Christian Arabs</a> sectors as "the most successful in education system", since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group in Israel. Israeli children from Russian-speaking families have a higher bagrut pass rate at high-school level. Although amongst immigrant children born in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Former_Soviet_Union" title="Former Soviet Union">Former Soviet Union</a>, the bagrut pass rate is highest amongst those families from European FSU states (at 62.6%), and lower amongst those from Central Asian and Caucasian FSU states. In 2003, over half of all Israeli twelfth graders earned a matriculation certificate.</p>

<p>The State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts, known as <i>mehozot</i> (מחוזות; singular: <i>mahoz</i>) – <a href="/wiki/Central_District_(Israel)" title="Central District (Israel)">Center</a>, <a href="/wiki/Haifa_District" title="Haifa District">Haifa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_District" title="Jerusalem District">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)" title="Northern District (Israel)">North</a>, <a href="/wiki/Southern_District_(Israel)" title="Southern District (Israel)">Southern</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv_District" title="Tel Aviv District">Tel Aviv Districts</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Judea_and_Samaria_Area" title="Judea and Samaria Area">Judea and Samaria Area</a> in the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern Districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel. Districts are further divided into fifteen sub-districts known as <i>nafot</i> (נפות; singular: <i>nafa</i>), which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions.</p>
<p>For statistical purposes, the country is divided into three metropolitan areas: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv_metropolitan_area" title="Tel Aviv metropolitan area">Tel Aviv metropolitan area</a> (population 3,206,400), <a href="/wiki/Haifa_metropolitan_area" title="Haifa metropolitan area">Haifa metropolitan area</a> (population 1,021,000), and <a href="/wiki/Beersheba_metropolitan_area" title="Beersheba metropolitan area">Beer Sheva metropolitan area</a> (population 559,700). Israel's largest municipality, in population and area, is <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with 773,800 residents in an area of 126 square kilometres (49 sq mi) (in 2009).

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories" title="Israeli-occupied territories">Israeli-occupied territories</a></div>

<p>In 1967, as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, Israel captured and <a href="/wiki/Military_occupation" title="Military occupation">occupied</a> the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, including <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" title="East Jerusalem">East Jerusalem</a>, the Gaza Strip and the <a href="/wiki/Golan_Heights" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a>. Israel also captured the <a href="/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula" title="Sinai Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>, but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Egypt_Peace_Treaty" title="Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty">Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty</a>. Between 1982 and 2000, Israel occupied part of <a href="/wiki/Southern_Lebanon" title="Southern Lebanon">southern Lebanon</a>, in what was known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/South_Lebanon_security_belt" title="South Lebanon security belt">Security Zone</a>.</p>
<p>Since Israel's capture of these territories, <a href="/wiki/Israeli_settlement" title="Israeli settlement">Israeli settlements</a> and military installations have been built within each of them. Israel has applied civilian law to the <a href="/wiki/Golan_Heights_Law" title="Golan Heights Law">Golan Heights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_Law" title="Jerusalem Law">East Jerusalem</a> and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship. The West Bank, outside of the Israeli settlements within the territory, has remained under direct military rule, and Palestinians in this area cannot become Israeli citizens. Israel withdrew its military forces and dismantled the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip as part of its <a href="/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza" title="Israeli disengagement from Gaza">disengagement from Gaza</a> though it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be "null and void" and continues to view the territories as occupied. The <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>, principal judicial organ of the United Nations, asserted, in its <a href="/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict#Ruling_of_the_ICJ" title="International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict">2004 advisory opinion</a> on the legality of the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>, that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory.</p>
<p>The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians, as Israel views it as its sovereign territory, as well as part of its capital. Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 242">United Nations Security Council Resolution 242</a>, which emphasises "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war", and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states, a principle known as "<a href="/wiki/Land_for_peace" title="Land for peace">Land for peace</a>".</p>

<p>The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1950, following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine. Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Jordan_Treaty_of_Peace" title="Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace">ceded</a> its claim to the territory to the <a href="/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">PLO</a>. The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War. The population are mainly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palestinian_people" title="Palestinian people">Palestinians</a>, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palestinian_refugee" title="Palestinian refugee">refugees</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1948_Arab-Israeli_War" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>. From their occupation in 1967 until 1993, the Palestinians living in these territories were under <a href="/wiki/Coordinator_of_Government_Activities_in_the_Territories" title="Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories">Israeli military administration</a>. Since the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel_%E2%80%93_Palestine_Liberation_Organization_letters_of_recognition" title="Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition">Israel–PLO letters of recognition</a>, most of the <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Palestinian_territories" title="Demographics of the Palestinian territories">Palestinian population</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Palestinian_Authority_areas" title="List of cities in Palestinian Authority areas">cities</a> have been under the internal jurisdiction of the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority" title="Palestinian National Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>, and only partial Israeli military control, although Israel has on several occasions redeployed its <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" title="Israel Defense Forces">troops</a> and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest. In response to increasing attacks as part of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Intifada" title="Second Intifada">Second Intifada</a>, the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier. When completed, approximately 13% of the Barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87% inside the West Bank.</p>
<p>The Gaza Strip was <a href="/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_Egypt" title="Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt">occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967</a> and then by Israel after 1967. In 2005, as part of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan" title="Israel's unilateral disengagement plan">Israel's unilateral disengagement plan</a>, Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory. Israel does not consider the Gaza Strip to be occupied territory and declared it a "foreign territory". That view has been disputed by numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the United Nations. Following June 2007, when <a href="/wiki/Governance_of_the_Gaza_Strip" title="Governance of the Gaza Strip">Hamas assumed power in the Gaza Strip</a>, Israel tightened its control of the Gaza crossings along its border, as well as by sea and air, and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian. Gaza has a border with Egypt and an agreement between Israel, the European Union and the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority" title="Palestinian National Authority">PA</a> governed how border crossing would take place (it was monitored by European observers). Egypt adhered to this agreement under Mubarak and prevented access to Gaza until April 2011 when it announced it was opening its border with Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel maintains diplomatic relations with 158 countries and has 107 <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_mission" title="Diplomatic mission">diplomatic missions</a> around the world; countries with whom they have no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries. Only three members of the <a href="/wiki/Arab_League" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> have normalized relations with Israel: Egypt and Jordan signed peace treaties in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Egypt_Peace_Treaty" title="Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty">1979</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Jordan_Treaty_of_Peace" title="Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace">1994</a>, respectively, and Mauritania opted for full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999. Despite the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, Israel is still widely considered an enemy country among Egyptians. Under Israeli law, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Yemen are enemy countries, and Israeli citizens may not visit them without permission from the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Interior_(Israel)" title="Ministry of Interior (Israel)">Ministry of the Interior</a>. <a href="/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations" title="Iran–Israel relations">Iran</a> had diplomatic relations with Israel under the <a href="/wiki/Pahlavi_dynasty" title="Pahlavi dynasty">Pahlavi dynasty</a> but withdrew its recognition of Israel during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Islamic_Revolution" title="Islamic Revolution">Islamic Revolution</a>. As a result of the <a href="/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309)" title="Gaza War (2008–09)">2008–09 Gaza War</a>, Mauritania, Qatar, Bolivia, and Venezuela suspended political and economic ties with Israel.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> were the first two countries to recognize the State of Israel, having declared recognition roughly simultaneously. The United States regards Israel as its "most reliable partner in the Middle East," based on "common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests". The United States has provided $68 billion in military assistance and $32 billion in grants to Israel since 1967, under the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Assistance_Act" title="Foreign Assistance Act">Foreign Assistance Act</a> (period beginning 1962), more than any other country for that period until 2003. The United Kingdom is seen as having a "natural" relationship with Israel on account of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine" title="British Mandate for Palestine">British Mandate for Palestine</a>. Relations between the two countries were also made stronger by former prime minister <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>'s efforts for a two state resolution. By 2007 Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to the Israeli state and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors. Israel is included in the European Union's <a href="/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy" title="European Neighbourhood Policy">European Neighbourhood Policy</a> (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.</p>
<p>Although Turkey and Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations until 1991, Turkey has cooperated with the State since its recognition of Israel in 1949. Turkey's ties to the other Muslim-majority nations in the region have at times resulted in pressure from Arab and Muslim states to temper its relationship with Israel. Relations between Turkey and Israel took a downturn after the <a href="/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309)" title="Gaza War (2008–09)">2008–09 Gaza War</a> and Israel's raid of the <a href="/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid" title="Gaza flotilla raid">Gaza flotilla</a>. Relations between Israel and Greece have improved since 1995 due to the decline of Israeli-Turkish relations. The two countries have a defense cooperation agreement and in 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force" title="Israeli Air Force">Israeli Air Force</a> hosted Greece's <a href="/wiki/Hellenic_Air_Force" title="Hellenic Air Force">Hellenic Air Force</a> in a joint exercise at the <a href="/wiki/Ovda_Airport" title="Ovda Airport">Uvda base</a>. The joint Cyprus-Israel oil and gas explorations centered on the <a href="/wiki/Leviathan_gas_field" title="Leviathan gas field">Leviathan gas field</a> are an important factor for Greece, given its strong links with <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Cooperation in the world's longest sub-sea electric power cable, the <a href="/wiki/EuroAsia_Interconnector" title="EuroAsia Interconnector">EuroAsia Interconnector</a>, has strengthened relations between Cyprus and Israel.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan is one of the few majority Muslim countries to develop bilateral strategic and economic relations with Israel. Azerbaijan supplies Israel with a substantial amount of its oil needs, and Israel has helped modernize the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan. India established full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992 and has fostered a strong military, technological and cultural partnership with the country since then. According to an international opinion survey conducted in 2009 on behalf of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, India is the most pro-Israel country in the world. India is the largest customer of Israeli military equipment and Israel is the second-largest military partner of India after the Russian Federation. In Africa, Ethiopia is Israel's main and closest ally in the continent due to common political, religious and security interests. Israel provides expertise to Ethiopia on irrigation projects and thousands of Ethiopian Jews (<a href="/wiki/Beta_Israel" title="Beta Israel">Beta Israel</a>) live in Israel.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International_humanitarian_efforts">International humanitarian efforts</span></h3>
<p>Israeli foreign aid ranks very low among OECD nations, spending less than 0.1% of its GNI on foreign aid, as opposed to the recommended 0.7%. Individual international charitable donations are also very low, with only 0.1% of charitable donations being sent to foreign causes. However, Israel has a history of providing emergency aid and humanitarian response teams to disasters across the world. Israel's humanitarian efforts officially began in 1958, with the establishment of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MASHAV" title="MASHAV">MASHAV</a>, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Agency for International Development Cooperation.</p>
<p>Between 1985 and 2015, Israel sent 24 delegations of <a href="/wiki/Home_Front_Command" title="Home Front Command">IDF search and rescue unit</a> to 22 countries. In Haiti, immediately following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2010_Haiti_Earthquake" title="2010 Haiti Earthquake">2010 earthquake</a>, Israel was the first country to set up a field hospital capable of performing surgical operations. Israel sent over 200 medical doctors and personnel to start treating injured Haitians at the scene. At the conclusion of its humanitarian mission 11 days later, the Israeli delegation had treated more than 1,110 patients, conducted 319 successful surgeries, delivered 16 births and rescued or assisted in the rescue of four individuals. Despite radiation concerns, Israel was one of the first countries to send a medical delegation to Japan following the earthquake and tsunami disaster. Israel dispatched a medical team to the tsunami-stricken city of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kurihara" title="Kurihara">Kurihara</a> in 2011.
