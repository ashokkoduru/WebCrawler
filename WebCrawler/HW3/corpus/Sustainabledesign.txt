<p><b>Sustainable design</b> (also called <a href="/wiki/Environmental_design" title="Environmental design">environmental design</a>, environmentally sustainable design, environmentally conscious design, etc.) is the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles of <a href="/wiki/Social_sustainability" title="Social sustainability">social</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic" title="Economic">economic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecological</a> <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Theory">Theory</span></h2>
<p>The intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design". Manifestations of sustainable design require <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_resources" title="Renewable resources">renewable resources</a>, impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment.</p>
<p>Great design is sustainable design: Rather than considering green building design as an externality, architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design. This includes better user experience and comfort, doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance, and maximizing the effectives of durable, quality materials. Rather than the well-known edict “form follows function,” it’s time to think “form follows environment.” </p>
<p>Beyond the "elimination of negative environmental impact", sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour. A dynamic balance between economy and society, intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Diminishing_returns">Diminishing returns</span></h4>
<p>The principle that all directions of progress run out, ending with diminishing returns, is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the <a href="/wiki/Technology_life_cycle" title="Technology life cycle">technology life cycle</a> and in the useful life of any system as discussed in <a href="/wiki/Industrial_ecology" title="Industrial ecology">industrial ecology</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment" title="Life cycle assessment">life cycle assessment</a>. Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits. Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity, the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere. (see also: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_diminishing_returns" title="Law of diminishing returns">law of diminishing returns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marginal_utility" title="Marginal utility">marginal utility</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jevons_paradox" title="Jevons paradox">Jevons paradox</a>.)</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Unsustainable_investment">Unsustainable investment</span></h4>
<p>A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see, so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons" title="Tragedy of the Commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>, but may lead to a collapse. This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Tainter" title="Joseph Tainter">Joseph Tainter</a> among others. This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mayan_Empire" title="Mayan Empire">Mayan</a>, among others. Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them, not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Waste_prevention">Waste prevention</span></h4>

<p><b>Negative Effects of Waste</b></p>
<p>About 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U.K. alone, for example, each year. And with reference to only household waste, between 1991/92 and 2007/08, each person in England generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day.</p>
<p>Experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal. All forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment, public health, and local economies. Landfills have contaminated drinking water. Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air, soil, and water. The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology. Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The toxic components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem. In the U.S., about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials, such as <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metals" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a> like <a href="/wiki/Nickel" title="Nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> from batteries, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_compounds" title="Organic compounds">organic compounds</a> found in pesticides and consumer products, such as air freshener sprays, nail polish, cleaners, and other products. When burned or buried, toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation. Pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem. It does not mean doing without, but doing differently. For example, preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages; it just means using refillable bottles.</p>
<p><b>Waste prevention strategies</b> In planning for facilities, a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste. A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through <a href="/wiki/Biodegradation" title="Biodegradation">biodegradation</a>. This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment.</p>
<p>Any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste — materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors. The following waste prevention strategies apply to both, although different approaches will be needed for implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic</li>
<li>compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes</li>
<li>reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainable_design_principles">Sustainable design principles</span></h3>

<p>.</p>

<p>While the practical application varies among disciplines , some common principles are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-impact materials: choose non-toxic, sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process</li>
<li>Energy efficiency: use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emotionally_durable_design" title="Emotionally durable design">Emotionally durable design</a>: reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products, through design</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Design_impact_measures" title="Design impact measures">Design impact measures</a> for total <a href="/wiki/Carbon_footprint" title="Carbon footprint">carbon footprint</a> and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available.^ Many are complex, but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts. One measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of 8,000 BTU (8,400 kJ) per dollar and producing CO2 at the average rate of 0.57 kg of CO2 per dollar (1995 dollars US) from DOE figures.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Sustainable_design_standards" title="Sustainable design standards">Sustainable design standards</a> and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals. There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions.</li>

<p>A model of the new design principles necessary for <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a> is exemplified by the "Bill of Rights for the Planet" or "Hannover Principles" - developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO 2000 that was held in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hannover,_Germany" title="Hannover, Germany">Hannover, Germany</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy, supportive, diverse, and sustainable conditions.</li>
<li>Recognize Interdependence. The elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world, with broad and diverse implications at every scale. Expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects.</li>
<li>Respect relationships between spirit and matter. Consider all aspects of human settlement including community, dwelling, industry, and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness.</li>
<li>Accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being, the viability of natural systems, and their right to co-exist.</li>
<li>Create safe objects of long-term value. Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products, processes, or standards.</li>
<li>Eliminate the concept of waste. Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes, to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste.</li>
<li>Rely on natural energy flows. Human designs should, like the living world, derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income. Incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use.</li>
<li>Understand the limitations of design. No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems. Those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature. Treat nature as a model and mentor, not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled.</li>
<li>Seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge. Encourage direct and open communication between colleagues, patrons, manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility, and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects (UIA) in June 1993 at the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) Expo 93 in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Further, the AIA and UIA signed a "Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future." In summary, the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA, UIA, and their members are committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities</li>
<li>Developing and continually improving practices, procedures, products, services, and standards for sustainable design</li>
<li>Educating the building industry, clients, and the general public about the importance of sustainable design</li>
<li>Working to change policies, regulations, and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice</li>
<li>Bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design (ICED), a coalition of architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering organizations, developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design. ICED states: The ethics, education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future. . . . To achieve this vision we will join . . . as a multidisciplinary partnership."</p>
<p>These activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive. The world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources.</p>

<p>Applications of this philosophy range from the <a href="/wiki/Macrocosm_and_microcosm" title="Macrocosm and microcosm">microcosm</a> — small objects for everyday use, through to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macrocosm" title="Macrocosm">macrocosm</a> — buildings, cities, and the Earth's physical surface.

<p>Sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global environmental crises, the rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>, and loss of <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. In 2013, eco architecture writer <a href="/wiki/Bridgette_Meinhold" title="Bridgette Meinhold">Bridgette Meinhold</a> surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book, “Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World.” Featured projects focus on <a href="/wiki/Green_building" title="Green building">green building</a>, sustainable design, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-friendly" title="Eco-friendly">eco-friendly</a> materials, <a href="/wiki/Affordable_housing" title="Affordable housing">affordability</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reusability" title="Reusability">material reuse</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humanitarian_relief" title="Humanitarian relief">humanitarian relief</a>.

<p>The limits of sustainable design are reducing. Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency. As a result, the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts. The present approach, which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services, does not solve this problem. The basic dilemmas include: the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements; the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones; that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized, but are distributed throughout the economies; and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beauty_and_sustainable_design">Beauty and sustainable design</span></h3>
<p>Because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics, some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration. <a href="/wiki/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize" title="Pritzker Architecture Prize">Pritzker Architecture Prize</a> winner <a href="/wiki/Frank_Gehry" title="Frank Gehry">Frank Gehry</a> has called green building "bogus," and <a href="/wiki/National_Design_Awards" title="National Design Awards">National Design Awards</a> winner <a href="/wiki/Peter_Eisenman" title="Peter Eisenman">Peter Eisenman</a> has dismissed it as "having nothing to do with architecture." In 2009, <i><a href="/wiki/The_American_Prospect" title="The American Prospect">The American Prospect</a></i> asked whether "well-designed green architecture" is an "oxymoron."</p>
<p>Others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided. A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect <a href="/wiki/Lance_Hosey" title="Lance Hosey">Lance Hosey</a>, whose book <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Shape_of_Green:_Aesthetics,_Ecology,_and_Design" title="The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, and Design">The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, and Design</a></i> (2012) was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty. Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful, but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed, creating things of even greater beauty. Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in <i>The Shape of Green</i> could "revolutionize what it means to be sustainable." Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs. Examples include <a href="/wiki/One_Central_Park" title="One Central Park">One Central Park</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Science_Faculty_building,_UTS" title="Science Faculty building, UTS">Science Faculty building, UTS</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emotionally_durable_design">Emotionally durable design</span></h3>

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Chapman_(academic)" title="Jonathan Chapman (academic)">Jonathan Chapman</a> of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Brighton" title="University of Brighton">University of Brighton</a>, UK, emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_resources" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a> by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products." Essentially, product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties. In his book, <i>Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences &amp; Empathy</i>, Chapman describes how "the process of consumption is, and has always been, motivated by complex emotional drivers, and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things; it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self, that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment, becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction". Therefore, a product requires an attribute, or number of attributes, which extend beyond utilitarianism.</p>
<p>According to Chapman, 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Narrative</b>: How users share a unique personal history with the product.</li>
<li><b>Consciousness</b>: How the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will.</li>
<li><b>Attachment</b>: Can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product?</li>
<li><b>Fiction</b>: The product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship.</li>
<li><b>Surface</b>: How the product ages and develops character through time and use.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a strategic approach, "emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible, well made, tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term." According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parsons_The_New_School_for_Design" title="Parsons The New School for Design">Parsons The New School for Design</a> in New York, “emotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users, as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to, and in, design things.”</p>

<p>Creative designers and artists are perhaps the most inventive when it comes to <a href="/wiki/Upcycling" title="Upcycling">upcycling</a> or creating new products from old waste. A growing number of designers <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Upcycle" title="Upcycle">upcycle</a> waste materials such as car window glass and recycled ceramics, textile offcuts from upholstery companies, and even decommissioned fire hose to make belts and bags. Whilst accessories may seem trivial when pitted against green scientific breakthroughs; the ability of fashion and retail to influence and inspire consumer behaviour should not be underestimated. Eco design may also use bi-products of industry, reducing the amount of waste being dumped in landfill, or may harness new sustainable materials or production techniques e.g. fabric made from recycled PET plastic bottles or bamboo textiles.</p>

<p>Sustainable architecture is the design of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_building" title="Sustainable building">sustainable buildings</a>. Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment" title="Life cycle assessment">lifecycle</a> of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems; <a href="/wiki/Alternative_energy" title="Alternative energy">alternative energy</a> sources such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_hot_water" title="Solar hot water">solar hot water</a>, appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on-site power generation - solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power; <a href="/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting" title="Rainwater harvesting">rainwater harvesting</a> for gardening, washing and <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> recharge; and on-site <a href="/wiki/Waste_management" title="Waste management">waste management</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Green_roof" title="Green roof">green roofs</a> that filter and control stormwater runoff. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation.</p>
<p>Sustainable architects design with <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_living" title="Sustainable living">sustainable living</a> in mind. Sustainable vs <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_design" title="Green design">green design</a> is the challenge that designs not only reflect healthy processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources. A test for sustainable design is — can the design function for its intended use without <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> — unplugged. This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution. As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested, architects will soon be able to create not only passive, null-emission buildings, but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design. In 2004 the 59 home housing community, the <a href="/wiki/Solar_Settlement" title="Solar Settlement">Solar Settlement</a>, and a 60,000 sq ft (5,600 m) integrated retail, commercial and residential building, the <a href="/wiki/Sonnenschiff" title="Sonnenschiff">Sun Ship</a>, were completed by architect <a href="/wiki/Rolf_Disch" title="Rolf Disch">Rolf Disch</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freiburg" title="Freiburg">Freiburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>.

<p>An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustics. The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure. ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture" title="Sustainable agriculture">Sustainable agriculture</a> adheres to three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental Health,</li>
<li>Economic Profitability,</li>
<li>Social and Economic Equity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A variety of philosophies, policies and practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>There are strenuous discussions — among others by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agricultural" title="Agricultural">agricultural</a> sector and authorities — if existing pesticide protocols and methods of <a href="/wiki/Soil_conservation" title="Soil conservation">soil conservation</a> adequately protect <a href="/wiki/Topsoil" title="Topsoil">topsoil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wildlife" title="Wildlife">wildlife</a>.

<p>Sustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydro_power" title="Hydro power">hydro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bioenergy" title="Bioenergy">bioenergy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_energy" title="Geothermal energy">geothermal</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>.

Wind energy is captured through the use of <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a> that generate and transfer electricity for utilities, homeowners and remote villages. Solar power can be harnessed through <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a>, concentrating solar, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_hot_water" title="Solar hot water">solar hot water</a> and is also a rapidly growing energy source.</p>
<p>The availability, potential, and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan. The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local, regional, and global environments. Responsible energy use is fundamental to <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> and a sustainable future. Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness, energy conservation, and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources.</p>

<p>Sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>Beyond the use of certain technologies, Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts. Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption, that is not necessarily for drinking purposes, is of potable water quality. This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called "fit-for-purpose". This more rational use of water achieves several economies, that are not only related to water itself, but also the consumption of energy, as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>In some countries the term <i>sustainable design</i> is known as <a href="/wiki/Ecodesign" title="Ecodesign">ecodesign</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_design" title="Green design">green design</a> or <a href="/wiki/Environmental_design" title="Environmental design">environmental design</a>. <a href="/wiki/Victor_Papanek" title="Victor Papanek">Victor Papanek</a>, embraced <a href="/wiki/Social_design" title="Social design">social design</a> and social quality and ecological quality, but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term. <i>Sustainable design</i> and <i>design for sustainability</i> are more common terms, including the <a href="/wiki/Triple_bottom_line" title="Triple bottom line">triple bottom line</a> (people, planet and profit).</p>
<p>In the EU, the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign. Little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the <a href="/wiki/Circular_economy" title="Circular economy">circular economy</a> package, that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of 2015. To this effect, an Ecothis.EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainable_technologies">Sustainable technologies</span></h2>
<p>Sustainable technologies use less energy, fewer limited resources, do not deplete natural resources, do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life. There is significant overlap with <a href="/wiki/Appropriate_technology" title="Appropriate technology">appropriate technology</a>, which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context, in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries. However, the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one; and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an "appropriate technology," as that term is commonly used.</p>
