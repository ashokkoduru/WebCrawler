<p>Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvents</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceuticals</a>, and industrial chemicals.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Consequences_of_persistence">Consequences of persistence</span></h2>
<p>POPs typically are halogenated organic compounds (see lists below) and as such exhibit high <a href="/wiki/Lipophilicity" title="Lipophilicity">lipid solubility</a>. For this reason, they <a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Adipose_tissue" title="Adipose tissue">fatty tissues</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Halogenated" title="Halogenated">Halogenated</a> compounds also exhibit great <a href="/wiki/Chemical_stability" title="Chemical stability">stability</a> reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward <a href="/wiki/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Photodissociation" title="Photodissociation">photolytic degradation</a>. The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern. They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels. Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as <a href="/wiki/Persistent,_bioaccumulative_and_toxic_substances" title="Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances">PBTs</a> (<b>P</b>ersistent, <b>B</b>ioaccumulative and <b>T</b>oxic) or TOMPs (<b>T</b>oxic <b>O</b>rganic <b>M</b>icro <b>P</b>ollutants).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Long-range_transport">Long-range transport</span></h3>
<p>POPs enter the <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gas</a> phase under certain environmental temperatures and <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" title="Volatility (chemistry)">volatize</a> from <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soils</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vegetation" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bodies_of_water" title="Bodies of water">bodies of water</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, resisting breakdown reactions in the air, to travel long distances before being re-deposited. This results in accumulation of POPs in areas far from where they were used or emitted, specifically environments where POPs have never been introduced such as <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arctic_circle" title="Arctic circle">Arctic circle</a>. POPs can be present as vapors in the atmosphere or bound to the surface of solid particles. POPs have low solubility in water but are easily captured by solid particles, and are soluble in organic fluids (<a href="/wiki/Oil" title="Oil">oils</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fats</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Liquid_fuel" title="Liquid fuel">liquid fuels</a>). POPs are not easily degraded in the environment due to their stability and low <a href="/wiki/Chemical_decomposition" title="Chemical decomposition">decomposition</a> rates. Due to this capacity for long-range transport, POP environmental contamination is extensive, even in areas where POPs have never been used, and will remain in these environments years after restrictions implemented due to their resistance to degradation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bioaccumulation">Bioaccumulation</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">Bioaccumulation</a> of POPs is typically associated with the compounds high lipid solubility and ability to accumulate in the <a href="/wiki/Adipose_tissue" title="Adipose tissue">fatty tissues</a> of living organisms for long periods of time. Persistent chemicals tend to have higher concentrations and are eliminated more slowly. Dietary accumulation or <a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulation</a> is another hallmark characteristic of POPs, as POPs move up the food chain, they increase in concentration as they are processed and metabolized in certain tissues of organisms. The natural capacity for animals <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract" title="Human gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal tract</a> concentrate ingested chemicals, along with poorly <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolized</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrophobic" title="Hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> nature of POPs makes such compounds highly susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulation</a>. Thus POPs not only persist in the environment, but also as they are taken in by animals they bioaccumulate, increasing their concentration and toxicity in the environment.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants">Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants</span></h2>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants" title="Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants">Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants</a></div>
<p>The Stockholm Convention was adopted and put into practice by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) on May 22, 2001. The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is "to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants." As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the “dirty dozen,” of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.</p>

<p>In May 1995, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> Governing Council investigated POPs. Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/Aldrin" title="Aldrin">Aldrin</a>, an insecticide used in soils to kill <a href="/wiki/Termite" title="Termite">termites</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Western_corn_rootworm" title="Western corn rootworm">Western corn rootworm</a>, and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Chlordane" title="Chlordane">Chlordane</a>, an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a> of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human <a href="/wiki/Carcinogen" title="Carcinogen">carcinogen</a>. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Dieldrin" title="Dieldrin">Dieldrin</a>, a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin’s half-life is approximately five years. Dieldrin is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, <a href="/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>, and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Endrin" title="Endrin">Endrin</a>, an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Heptachlor" title="Heptachlor">Heptachlor</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticide</a> primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations – <a href="/wiki/Canada_goose" title="Canada goose">Canada geese</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_kestrel" title="American kestrel">American kestrels</a>. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Hexachlorobenzene" title="Hexachlorobenzene">Hexachlorobenzene</a> (HCB), was first introduced in 1945–1959 to treat seeds because it can kill <a href="/wiki/Fungicide" title="Fungicide">fungi</a> on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, <a href="/wiki/Colic" title="Colic">colic</a>, debilitation, and a <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome" title="Metabolic syndrome">metabolic disorder</a> called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mirex" title="Mirex">Mirex</a>, an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a <a href="/wiki/Flame_retardant" title="Flame retardant">flame retardant</a> in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years. Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and <a href="/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustacean</a> species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Toxaphene" title="Toxaphene">Toxaphene</a>, an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyls" title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">Polychlorinated biphenyls</a> (PCBs), used as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat-transfer_oil" title="Heat-transfer oil">heat exchange fluids</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Transformer" title="Transformer">electrical transformers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Capacitor" title="Capacitor">capacitors</a>, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of <a href="/wiki/Halogenation" title="Halogenation">halogenation</a>, an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mucous_membranes" title="Mucous membranes">mucous membranes</a> and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transgenerational_epigenetics" title="Transgenerational epigenetics">transgenerational</a>, as the chemical can persist in a mother’s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane</a> (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a> published <a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a>, describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT’s persistence in the soil for up to 10–15 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dioxins" title="Dioxins">Dioxins</a> are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and <a href="/wiki/Hazardous_waste" title="Hazardous waste">hazardous waste</a>, along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, chloracne, and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_dibenzofurans" title="Polychlorinated dibenzofurans">Polychlorinated dibenzofurans</a> are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a> after <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">waste incineration</a> or in automobiles, pesticide production, and polychlorinated biphenyl production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Additive_and_synergistic_effects">Additive and synergistic effects</span></h2>
<p>Evaluation of the effects of POPs on health is very challenging in the laboratory setting. For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture of POPs, the effects are assumed to be <a href="/wiki/Interaction" title="Interaction">additive</a>. Mixtures of POPs can in principle produce <a href="/wiki/Interaction" title="Interaction">synergistic effects</a>. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_effects">Health effects</span></h2>
<p>POP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per <a href="/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer" title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">IARC</a>, possibly including <a href="/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>.

People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb. For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.</p>
<p>Studies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_health_risk_assessment" title="Human health risk assessment">human health risk assessment</a> which takes into account the pollutants' <a href="/wiki/Bioavailability" title="Bioavailability">bioavailability</a> and their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dose-response_relationship" title="Dose-response relationship">dose-response relationships</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Endocrine_disruption">Endocrine disruption</span></h3>
<p>The majority of POPs are known to disrupt normal functioning of the endocrine system, for example all of the dirty dozen are endocrine disruptors. Low level exposure to POPs during critical <a href="/wiki/Developmental_biology" title="Developmental biology">developmental</a> periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout its lifespan. A 2002 study synthesizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism’s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are <a href="/wiki/In_utero" title="In utero">in utero</a>, <a href="/wiki/In_ovo" title="In ovo">in ovo</a>, and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during <a href="/wiki/Prenatal_development" title="Prenatal development">fetal development</a>.</p>

The higher the concentration of POPs found in lipoproteins, the higher the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Highly chlorinated <a href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl" title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyls</a> are specifically found in high concentrations in lipoproteins. Cardiovascular disease is shown to be more associated with higher concentrations of POPs in <a href="/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein" title="High-density lipoprotein">high density lipoproteins</a> and cancer is shown to be more associated with higher concentrations of POPs in <a href="/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein" title="Low-density lipoprotein">low density lipoproteins</a> and very low density lipoproteins.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obesity">Obesity</span></h3>
<p>There have been many recent studies assessing the connection between <a href="/wiki/Serum_(blood)" title="Serum (blood)">serum</a> POP levels in individuals and instances of <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">obesity</a>. A study released in 2011 found correlations between different POPs and obesity occurrence in individuals tested. The <a href="/wiki/Statistical_significance" title="Statistical significance">statistically significant</a> findings from the study show that there is actually a <a href="/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence" title="Correlation and dependence">negative correlation</a> between various <a href="/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl" title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</a> <a href="/wiki/Congener_(chemistry)" title="Congener (chemistry)">congener</a> serum levels and obesity in individuals tested. The study also showed a <a href="/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence" title="Correlation and dependence">positive correlation</a> between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane" title="Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane">beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</a> and various <a href="/wiki/Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds" title="Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds">dioxin</a> serum levels and obesity in individuals tested. Obesity was determined using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Body_Mass_Index" title="Body Mass Index">Body Mass Index</a> (BMI). One proposed explanation in the study is that PCBs are very lipophilic, therefore they are easily stored and captured in the fat deposits in human beings. Obese individuals have higher amounts of fat deposits in their body, and thus more PCBs could be captured in the fat deposits leading to less PCBs circulating in blood serum. The study provides evidence demonstrating that the correlation between POP serum levels and obesity occurrence is more complicated than previously expected. The same study also noted a strong positive correlation between serum POP levels and age in all individuals in the experiment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diabetes">Diabetes</span></h3>
<p>A study published in 2006 revealed a positive correlation between POP serum levels and <a href="/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2" title="Diabetes mellitus type 2">type II diabetes</a> in individuals, after other variables, such as age, sex, race, and <a href="/wiki/Socioeconomic_status" title="Socioeconomic status">socioeconomic status</a> were adjusted for. The correlation proved stronger in younger, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mexican_American" title="Mexican American">Mexican American</a>, and obese individuals. Individuals exposed to low doses of POPs throughout their lifetime had a higher chance for developing diabetes than individuals exposed to high concentrations of POPs for a short amount of time.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_urban_areas_and_indoor_environments">In urban areas and indoor environments</span></h2>
<p>Traditionally it was thought that human exposure to POPs occurred primarily through <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a>, however <a href="/wiki/Indoor_air_quality" title="Indoor air quality">indoor pollution</a> patterns that characterize certain POPs have challenged this notion. Recent studies of indoor <a href="/wiki/Dust" title="Dust">dust</a> and <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="Atmosphere of Earth">air</a> have implicated indoor environments as a major sources for human exposure via inhalation and ingestion. Furthermore, significant indoor POP pollution must be a major route of human POP exposure, considering the modern trend in spending larger proportions of life indoor. Several studies have shown that indoor (air and dust) POP levels to exceed outdoor (air and soil) POP concentrations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Control_and_removal_in_the_environment">Control and removal in the environment</span></h2>
<p>Current studies aimed at minimizing POPs in the environment are investigating their behavior in <a href="/wiki/Photocatalysis" title="Photocatalysis">photo catalytic oxidation reactions</a>. POPs that are found in humans and in <a href="/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem" title="Aquatic ecosystem">aquatic environments</a> the most are the main subjects of these experiments. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aromatic_compound" title="Aromatic compound">Aromatic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aliphatic_compound" title="Aliphatic compound">aliphatic</a> degradation products have been identified in these reactions. <a href="/wiki/Photocatalysis" title="Photocatalysis">Photochemical degradation</a> is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation. However, proper removal techniques of POPs from the environment are still unclear, due to fear that more toxic byproducts may result from uninvestigated degradation techniques. Current efforts are more focused on banning the use and production of POPs worldwide rather than removal of POPs.</p>
