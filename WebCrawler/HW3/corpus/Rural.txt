<p>In general, a <b>rural area</b> or <b>countryside</b> is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. The Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines the word "rural" as encompassing "...all population, housing, and territory not included within an <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban area</a>. Whatever is not urban is considered rural."</p>
<p>Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">Agricultural</a> areas are commonly rural, though so are others such as <a href="/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a>. Different countries have varying definitions of "rural" for statistical and administrative purposes.</p>

<p>In Canada, the <a href="/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> defines a "predominantly rural region" as having more than 50% of the population living in rural communities where a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rural_community" title="Rural community">rural community</a>" has a population density less than 150 people per square kilometre. In Canada, the census division has been used to represent "regions" and census consolidated sub-divisions have been used to represent "communities". Intermediate regions have 15 to 49 percent of their population living in a rural community. Predominantly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urban_region" title="Urban region">urban regions</a> have less than 15 percent of their population living in a rural community. Predominantly rural regions are classified as rural metro-adjacent, rural non-metro-adjacent and rural northern, following Ehrensaft and Beeman (1992). Rural metro-adjacent regions are predominantly rural <a href="/wiki/Census_division" title="Census division">census divisions</a> which are adjacent to metropolitan centres while rural non-metro-adjacent regions are those predominantly rural census divisions which are not adjacent to metropolitan centres. Rural northern regions are predominantly rural census divisions that are found either entirely or mostly above the following lines of parallel in each province: <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, 50th; <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> 54,<a href="/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, 54th; <a href="/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, 53rd; <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> and <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, 54th.

<p>Statistics Canada defines rural for their population counts. This definition has changed over time (see Appendix A in du Plessis et al., 2002). Typically, it has referred to the population living outside settlements of 1,000 or less inhabitants. The current definition states that census rural is the population outside settlements with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants and a population density below 400 people per square kilometre (Statistics Canada, 2007).</p>

United States Census Bureau: The Census Bureau definitions (new to the 2000 census), which are based on population density, defines rural areas as all territory outside of Census Bureau-defined urbanized areas and urban clusters.</p>
<ul>
<li>An urbanized area consists of a central surrounding areas whose population ("urban nucleus") is greater than 50,000. They may or may not contain individual cities with 50,000 or more; rather, they must have a core with a population density generally exceeding 1,000 persons per square mile; and may contain adjoining territory with at least 500 persons per square mile (other towns outside of an urbanized area whose population exceeds 2,500).</li>
<li>Thus, rural areas comprise open country and settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents; areas designated as rural can have population densities as high as 999 per square mile or as low as 1 person per square mile.</li>

<p><b>USDA</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The USDA's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Office_of_Rural_Development" title="Office of Rural Development">Office of Rural Development</a> may define rural by various population thresholds. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2002_farm_bill" title="2002 farm bill">2002 farm bill</a> (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 6020) defined rural and rural area as any area other than (1) a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants, and (2) the urbanized areas contiguous and adjacent to such a city or town.</li>
<li>The rural-urban continuum codes, urban influence code, and rural county typology codes developed by USDA’s <a href="/wiki/Economic_Research_Service" title="Economic Research Service">Economic Research Service</a> (ERS) allow researchers to break out the standard metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas into smaller residential groups. For example, a metropolitan county is one that contains an urbanized area, or one that has a twenty-five percent commuter rate to an urbanized area regardless of population.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>OMB</b>:</p>
<p>Under the Core Based Statistical Areas used by the OMB (commonly referred to as 'CBSA Codes'),</p>
<ul>
<li>a metropolitan county, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Statistical_Area" title="Metropolitan Statistical Area">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>, consists of (1) central counties with one or more urbanized areas (as defined by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Census_Bureau" title="Census Bureau">Census Bureau</a>) and (2) outlying counties that are economically tied to the core counties as measured by worker commuting data (i.e. if 25% of workers living there commute to the core counties, or if 25% of the employment in the county consists of workers coming from the central counties).</li>
<li>Non-metro counties are outside the boundaries of metro areas and are further subdivided into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Micropolitan_Statistical_Area" title="Micropolitan Statistical Area">Micropolitan Statistical Areas</a> centered on urban clusters of 10,000–50,000 residents, and all remaining non-core counties.</li>

<p><a href="/wiki/Rural_health" title="Rural health">Rural health</a> definitions can be different for establishing under-served areas or health care accessibility in rural areas of the United States. According to the handbook, Definitions of Rural: A Handbook for Health Policy Makers and Researchers, "Residents of metropolitan counties are generally thought to have easy access to the relatively concentrated health services of the county's central areas. However, some metropolitan counties are so large that they contain small towns and rural, sparsely populated areas that are isolated from these central clusters and their corresponding health services by physical barriers." To address this type of rural area, "Harold Goldsmith, Dena Puskin, and Dianne Stiles (1992) described a methodology to identify small towns and rural areas within large metropolitan counties (LMCs) that were isolated from central areas by distance or other physical features." This became the Goldsmith Modification definition of rural. "Bhoomeet rural education The Goldsmith Modification has been useful for expanding the eligibility for federal programs that assist rural populations—to include the isolated rural populations of large metropolitan counties."</p>
<p>Health care delivery in rural areas of the United States can be challenging. From 2005-2011, the rate of potentially preventable hospitalizations for acute conditions was highest in rural areas (as compared to large metropolitan, small metropolitan, or micropolitan areas).</p>

More than half of Germany's territory – <a class="external text" href="http://www.bmelv.de/SharedDocs/Standardartikel/EN/Agriculture/FarminginGermany.html" rel="nofollow">almost 19 million hectares</a> – is used for farming, and are located in the rural areas. Almost 10% of employees in Germany has work linked directly or indirectly with the agricultural, forest and fisheries sectors; approximately a fifth of them are employed in primary production. The implication is that, unlike in some other European countries, where rural areas are known for being backward when compared to urban areas, in Germany, the trend is changing. Due to the country's policy of equal living conditions, this is not the case in Germany. Rural areas receive nearly equivalent attention as the urban areas do. Also, through a special approach to rural development, usually referred to as Village Renewal, the challenges of rural Germany are taken care of.</p>

<p>Rural areas are also known as the 'countryside' or a '<a href="/wiki/Village" title="Village">village</a>' in India. It has a very low population density.

<p>The quest to discover the real rural India still continues in great earnest. Almost every economic agency today has a definition of rural India. Here are a few definitions:</p>
<p>According to the Planning Commission, a town with a maximum population of 15,000 is considered rural in nature. In these areas the <a href="/wiki/Panchayati_raj" title="Panchayati raj">panchayat</a> makes all the decisions. There are five persons in the <a href="/wiki/Panchayati_raj" title="Panchayati raj">panchayat</a>. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) defines ‘rural’ as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An area with a population density of up to 400 per square kilometer,</li>
<li>Villages with clear surveyed boundaries but no municipal board,</li>
<li>A minimum of 75% of male working population involved in agriculture and allied activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>RBI defines rural areas as those areas with a population of less than 49,000 (tier -3 to tier-6 cities).</p>
<p>It is generally said that the rural areas house up to 70% of India’s population. Rural India contributes a large chunk to India’s GDP by way of agriculture, self-employment, services, construction etc. As per a strict measure used by the National Sample Survey in its 63rd round, called monthly per capita expenditure, rural expenditure accounts for 55% of total national monthly expenditure. The rural population currently accounts for one-third of the total Indian FMCG sales.</p>
