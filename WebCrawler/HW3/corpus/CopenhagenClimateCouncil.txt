<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>
<p>The Copenhagen Climate Council was founded in 2007 by the leading independent think tank in Scandinavia, <a class="external text" href="http://www.copenhagenclimatecouncil.com/about-us/about-monday-morning.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Monday Morning</i></a>, headquartered in <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose">Purpose</span></h3>
<p>The purpose of the Copenhagen Climate Council is to create global awareness of the importance of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN" title="UN">UN</a> Climate Summit (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COP15" title="COP15">COP15</a>) in Copenhagen, December 2009. Leading up to this pivotal UN meeting, the Copenhagen Climate Council works on presenting innovative yet achievable solutions to climate change, as well as assess what is required to make a new global treaty effective. The Council will seek to promote constructive dialogue between government and business, so that when the world's political leaders and negotiators meet in Copenhagen, they will do so armed with the very best arguments for establishing a treaty that can be supported by global business. By promoting and demonstrating innovative, positive, and meaningful business leadership and ideas, the Copenhagen Climate Council aims to demonstrate that achieving an effective global climate treaty is not only possible, but necessary. The strategy is built upon the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Creating international awareness</b> of the importance of the Copenhagen UN Climate Summit and the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.</li>
<li><b>Promoting constructive dialogue</b> between government, business, and science.</li>
<li><b>Inspiring global business leaders</b> by demonstrating that tackling climate change also has the potential to create huge opportunities for innovation and economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manifesto">Manifesto</span></h3>
<p>Published in November 2007, on the eve of the UN <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/COP13" title="COP13">COP13</a> Climate Change Conference in Bali – the instigation night of the <a href="/wiki/Bali_Road_Map" title="Bali Road Map">Bali Road Map</a>. The document outlines what the Council believes is required to tackle climate change and how this can be achieved through a new global treaty. The Manifesto articulates a clear goal for the maximum level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2050. The document will serve as input at the <i>World Business Summit on Climate Change</i>, outlining key elements for further discussion and inclusion in the recommendations to be delivered to the UN Summit.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Membership">Membership</span></h3>

The Thought Leadership Series is aimed at elucidating and creating awareness of the key elements in the business and policy response to the climate problem.

<p><i>The themes of the Thought Leadership series are:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>01 Tackling Emissions Growth: The Role of Markets and Government Regulation</li>
<li>02 Achieving low emissions energy systems in rapidly developing economies</li>
<li>03 Drawing down CO2 from the atmosphere</li>
<li>04 The role of city planning and buildings in tackling emissions growth</li>
<li>05 Achieving the capital investment required to tackle climate change</li>
<li>06 The CEO's survival guide to climate change</li>

Climate LIFE is intended to be “a virtual tour of how communities across the globe can both fight climate change and adapt to a warming world”. The purpose of Climate LIFE is to encourage awareness of and appreciation for the human and commercial potential in a low carbon future.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="FILM_:_.E2.80.9CClimate_LIFE_-_the_5th_revolution.E2.80.9D">FILM : “Climate LIFE - the 5th revolution”</span></h4>
<p><i>Climate LIFE - the 5th revolution</i> is an “emotional and strong story” of a journey across the world in search of the solutions so urgently needed for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avoiding_dangerous_climate_change" title="Avoiding dangerous climate change">avoiding a world climate life gone a wreck</a>. It is produced in the realisation that we need a new climate agenda in order to achieve a transition to a sustainable society. The Copenhagen Climate Council has stated it is “necessary” to tell the story of climate change using a new positive language that can appeal to new audiences. Particularly, the Copenhagen Climate Council wishes to use “evocative and emotional storytelling” to get behind the real motivations, which has made pioneers, community leaders and others act on climate changes. Through compelling and evocative story-telling, the audiences will themselves feel the urgency of the quest and be inspired to take action. Climate LIFE will be a follow-up to Al Gore's 'An inconvenient truth'. Where Al Gore opened the world's eyes to the massiveness of climate change, Climate LIFE intends to tell the new convenient truth of climate change - that the knowledge and solutions we know today give us the opportunity to create communities that enhance quality of life; that it is possible to build a greener, safer and more sustainable Earth. <i>Climate Life - the 5th revolution</i> aims to show that the precondition for the success is already present. A short feature will be launched at the World Business Summit on Climate Change and subsequently it will be shown at events, on the web, and will also be distributed to TV broadcasters across the world. The film is produced in collaboration with Koncern Film and TV.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_LIFE_Digital_exhibition">The LIFE Digital exhibition</span></h4>
<p>The <i>LIFE digital Exhibition</i> is intended to demonstrate what makes Climate LIFE possible. When launched on the web, it will explore the delivery model necessary to achieve the vision of Climate LIFE. Looking at the political, economic and cultural systems as well as the technological and biological process that will underpin low carbon living in the future, the exhibition will present a variety of practical solutions and their implications, highlighting the state of the art in movement, energy production and efficient consumption, water and waste management etc. The exhibition aims to use the latest social software advances and interactive tools to illustrate the challenges, how they affect people, and the possibilities for getting involved.</p>

Conference participants will present and debate relevant policy and business models that can support technology innovation in carbon emissions reduction. In an effort to create models of the relationships in business, policy, and technology to help guide innovative and rational decision making at the 2009 UN Summit, a suite of tools was developed, better known as the <a class="external text" href="http://www.citris-uc.org/publications/articles/navigating_climate_change_tools_un_summit_and_beyond" rel="nofollow">Climate Navigator</a>.

It will also be a digital library, organizing the growing base of knowledge about how business models and policy can influence technology.
