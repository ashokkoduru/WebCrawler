<p><b>Dangerous goods</b> or <b>hazardous goods</b> are <a href="/wiki/Solid" title="Solid">solids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a> that can harm people, other living <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a>, property, or the environment. They are often subject to <a href="/wiki/Regulation_of_chemicals" title="Regulation of chemicals">chemical regulations</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and sometimes in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, dangerous goods are more commonly known as <b>hazardous materials</b> (abbreviated as <b>HAZMAT</b> or <b>hazmat</b>). Hazmat teams are personnel specially trained to handle dangerous goods, which include materials that are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactive" title="Radioactive">radioactive</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flammable" title="Flammable">flammable</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Explosive" title="Explosive">explosive</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corrosive" title="Corrosive">corrosive</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidizer" title="Oxidizer">oxidizing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asphyxiant_gas" title="Asphyxiant gas">asphyxiating</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biohazard" title="Biohazard">biohazardous</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogenic</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Allergen" title="Allergen">allergenic</a>. Also included are physical conditions such as compressed gases and liquids or hot materials, including all goods containing such materials or chemicals, or may have other characteristics that render them hazardous in specific circumstances.</p>
<p>In the United States, dangerous goods are often indicated by diamond-shaped signage on the item (see <a href="/wiki/NFPA_704" title="NFPA 704">NFPA 704</a>), its container, or the building where it is stored. The color of each diamond indicates its hazard, e.g., flammable is indicated with red, because fire and heat are generally of red color, and explosive is indicated with orange, because mixing red (flammable) with yellow (oxidizing agent) creates orange. A nonflammable or nontoxic gas is indicated with green, because all compressed air vessels are this color in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> after World War II, and France was where the diamond system of hazmat identification originated.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Handling">Handling</span></h2>


<p>Mitigating the risks associated with hazardous materials may require the application of safety precautions during their <a href="/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">transport</a>, use, storage and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waste_disposal" title="Waste disposal">disposal</a>. Most countries regulate hazardous materials by law, and they are subject to several international treaties as well. Even so, different countries may use different class diamonds for the same product. For example, in Australia, Anhydrous Ammonia UN 1005 is classified as 2.3 (Toxic Gas) with sub risk 8 (Corrosive), whereas in the U.S. it is only classified as 2.2 (Non Flammable Gas).</p>
<p>People who handle dangerous goods will often wear protective equipment, and metropolitan <a href="/wiki/Fire_department" title="Fire department">fire departments</a> often have a response team specifically trained to deal with accidents and spills. Persons who may come into contact with dangerous goods as part of their work are also often subject to monitoring or health surveillance to ensure that their exposure does not exceed <a href="/wiki/Occupational_exposure_limit" title="Occupational exposure limit">occupational exposure limits</a>.</p>
<p>Laws and regulations on the use and handling of hazardous materials may differ depending on the activity and status of the material. For example, one set of requirements may apply to their use in the workplace while a different set of requirements may apply to spill response, sale for consumer use, or transportation. Most countries regulate some aspect of hazardous materials.</p>

<p>The most widely applied regulatory scheme is that for the transportation of dangerous goods. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council" title="United Nations Economic and Social Council">United Nations Economic and Social Council</a> issues the <i><a href="/wiki/UN_Recommendations_on_the_Transport_of_Dangerous_Goods" title="UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods">UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods</a></i>, which form the basis for most regional, national, and international regulatory schemes. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization" title="International Civil Aviation Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> has developed dangerous goods regulations for air transport of hazardous materials that are based upon the UN Model but modified to accommodate unique aspects of air transport. Individual airline and governmental requirements are incorporated with this by the <a href="/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association" title="International Air Transport Association">International Air Transport Association</a> to produce the widely used <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IATA" title="IATA">IATA</a> <i><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=IATA_DGR&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="IATA DGR (page does not exist)">Dangerous Goods Regulations</a></i> (DGR). Similarly, the <a href="/wiki/International_Maritime_Organization" title="International Maritime Organization">International Maritime Organization</a> (IMO) has developed the <a href="/wiki/International_Maritime_Dangerous_Goods_Code" title="International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code">International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code</a> ("IMDG Code", part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea" title="International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea">International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea</a>) for transportation of dangerous goods by sea. IMO member countries have also developed the <a href="/wiki/HNS_Convention" title="HNS Convention">HNS Convention</a> to provide compensation in case of dangerous goods spills in the sea.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Organisation_for_International_Carriage_by_Rail" title="Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail">Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail</a> has developed the Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail ("RID", part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Convention_concerning_International_Carriage_by_Rail" title="Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail">Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail</a>). Many individual nations have also structured their dangerous goods transportation regulations to harmonize with the UN Model in organization as well as in specific requirements.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Globally_Harmonized_System_of_Classification_and_Labelling_of_Chemicals" title="Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals">Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals</a> (GHS) is an internationally agreed upon system set to replace the various classification and labeling standards used in different countries.

<p>Dangerous goods are divided into nine classes (in addition to several subcategories) on the basis of the specific chemical characteristics producing the risk.</p>
<p>Note: The graphics and text in this article representing the dangerous goods safety marks are derived from the United Nations-based system of identifying dangerous goods. Not all countries use precisely the same graphics (label, <a href="/wiki/Placard" title="Placard">placard</a> and/or text information) in their national regulations. Some use graphic symbols, but without English wording or with similar wording in their national language. Refer to the Dangerous Goods Transportation Regulations of the country of interest.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h2>
<p>Transportation of dangerous goods (hazardous materials) in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> by road is normally a provincial jurisdiction. The federal government has jurisdiction over air, most marine, and most rail transport. The federal government acting centrally created the federal transportation of dangerous goods act and regulations, which provinces adopted in whole or in part via provincial transportation of dangerous goods legislation. The result is that all provinces use the federal regulations as their standard within their province; some small variances can exist because of provincial legislation. Creation of the federal regulations was coordinated by <a href="/wiki/Transport_Canada" title="Transport Canada">Transport Canada</a>. Hazard classifications are based upon the UN Model.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Europe">Europe</span></h2>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> has passed numerous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Union_directive" title="European Union directive">directives</a> and regulations to avoid the dissemination and restrict the usage of hazardous substances, important ones being the <a href="/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive" title="Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive">Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Registration,_Evaluation_and_Authorization_of_Chemicals" title="Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals">REACH</a> regulation.

<p>European law distinguishes clearly between the law of dangerous goods and the law of hazardous materials. The first refers primarily to the transport of the respective goods including the interim storage, if caused by the transport. The latter describes the requirements of storage (including warehousing) and usage of hazardous materials. This distinction is important, because different directives and orders of European law are applied.</p>

<p>Due to the increase in the threat of <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> in the early 21st century after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, funding for greater hazmat-handling capabilities was increased throughout the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, recognizing that flammable, poisonous, explosive, or radioactive substances in particular could be used for terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_and_Hazardous_Materials_Safety_Administration" title="Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration">Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration</a> regulates hazmat transportation within the territory of the US by <i><a href="/wiki/Title_49_of_the_Code_of_Federal_Regulations" title="Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations">Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations</a></i>.</p>
<p>The U.S. <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) regulates the handling of hazardous materials in the workplace as well as response to hazardous-materials-related incidents, most notably through <i>Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response</i> (<i><a href="/wiki/HAZWOPER" title="HAZWOPER">HAZWOPER</a></i>). regulations found at 29 CFR 1910.120.</p>
<p>In 1984 the agencies OSHA, EPA, USCG, NIOSH jointly published the first <i>Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Guidance Manual</i> which is available for download, or can be purchased from the US Government Printing Office, Pub. 85-115.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) regulates hazardous materials as they may impact the community and environment, including specific regulations for environmental cleanup and for handling and disposal of waste hazardous materials. For instance, transportation of hazardous materials is regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Hazardous_Materials_Transportation_Act" title="Hazardous Materials Transportation Act">Hazardous Materials Transportation Act</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Resource_Conservation_and_Recovery_Act" title="Resource Conservation and Recovery Act">Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</a> was also passed to further protect human and environmental health.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission" title="Consumer Product Safety Commission">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> regulates hazardous materials that may be used in products sold for household and other consumer uses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hazard_classes_for_materials_in_transport">Hazard classes for materials in transport</span></h3>
<p>Following the UN Model, the DOT divides regulated hazardous materials into nine classes, some of which are further subdivided. Hazardous materials in transportation must be placarded and have specified <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packaging_and_labelling" title="Packaging and labelling">packaging and labelling</a>. Some materials must always be placarded, others may only require placarding in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Trailers of goods in transport are usually marked with a four digit <a href="/wiki/UN_number" title="UN number">UN number</a>. This number, along with standardized logs of hazmat information, can be referenced by first responders (<a href="/wiki/Firefighter" title="Firefighter">firefighters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Police_officer" title="Police officer">police officers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ambulance" title="Ambulance">ambulance</a> personnel) who can find information about the material in the <i><a href="/wiki/Emergency_Response_Guidebook" title="Emergency Response Guidebook">Emergency Response Guidebook</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fixed_facilities">Fixed facilities</span></h3>
<p>Different standards usually apply for handling and marking hazmats at fixed facilities, including <a href="/wiki/NFPA_704" title="NFPA 704">NFPA 704</a> diamond markings (a consensus standard often adopted by local governmental jurisdictions), OSHA regulations requiring chemical safety information for employees, and CPSC requirements requiring informative labeling for the public, as well as wearing <a href="/wiki/Hazmat_suit" title="Hazmat suit">hazmat suits</a> when handling hazardous materials.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Packing_groups">Packing groups</span></h2>

<p>Packing groups are used for the purpose of determining the degree of protective packaging required for Dangerous Goods during transportation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group I: great danger, and most protective packaging required. Some combinations of different classes of dangerous goods on the same <a href="/wiki/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">vehicle</a> or in the same <a href="/wiki/Shipping_container" title="Shipping container">container</a> are forbidden if one of the goods is Group I.</li>
<li>Group II: medium danger</li>
<li>Group III: least danger among regulated goods, and least protective packaging within the transportation requirement</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_documents">Transport documents</span></h2>
<p>One of the transport regulations is that, as an assistance during emergency situations, written instructions how to deal in such need to be carried and easily accessible in the driver’s cabin.</p>
<p>A license or permit card for hazmat training must be presented when requested by officials.</p>
<p>Dangerous goods shipments also require a special declaration form prepared by the shipper. Among the information that is generally required includes the shipper's name and address; the consignee's name and address; descriptions of each of the dangerous goods, along with their quantity, classification, and packaging; and emergency contact information. Common formats include the one issued by the <a href="/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association" title="International Air Transport Association">International Air Transport Association</a> (IATA) for air shipments and the form by the <a href="/wiki/International_Maritime_Organization" title="International Maritime Organization">International Maritime Organization</a> (IMO) for sea cargo.</p>
