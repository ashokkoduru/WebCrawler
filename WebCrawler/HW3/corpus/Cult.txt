<p>The term "<b>cult</b>" usually refers to a <a href="/wiki/Social_group" title="Social group">social group</a> defined by common <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religious</a> beliefs. It is from <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>cultus</i> (<a href="/wiki/Worship" title="Worship">worship</a>). This, in turn, was derived from the adjective <i>cultus</i> (inhabited, cultivated, worshiped), based on the verb <i>colere</i> (care, cultivate). Some scholars reject the term entirely, since many people use the term to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dehumanize" title="Dehumanize">dehumanize</a> the members of groups.

Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.</p>

<p>The word "cult" was originally used not to describe a group of religionists, but for the act of <a href="/wiki/Worship" title="Worship">worship</a> or religious ceremony. It was first used in the early 17th century, borrowed via the <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> <i>culte,</i> from <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>cultus</i> (worship). This, in turn, was derived from the adjective <i>cultus</i> (inhabited, cultivated, worshiped), based on the verb <i>colere</i> (care, cultivate). The word "culture" is also derived from the Latin words <i>cultura</i> and <i>cultus</i>, which in general terms refers to the customary beliefs, social forms and material traits of a religious or social group.</p>
<p>While the literal sense of the word in English is still in use, a derived sense of "excessive devotion" arose in the 19th century. The terms <i>cult</i> and <i>cultist</i> came to be used in <a href="/wiki/Medical_literature" title="Medical literature">medical literature</a> in the United States in the 1930s for what would now be termed <a href="/wiki/Faith_healing" title="Faith healing">faith healing</a>, especially for the US <a href="/wiki/Holiness_movement" title="Holiness movement">Holiness movement</a>. This experienced a surge of popularity at the time, but extended to other forms of <a href="/wiki/Alternative_medicine" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> as well. In the English speaking world, the word often carries derogatory connotations, but in other European languages, it is used as English-speakers use the word "religion", sometimes causing confusion for English-speakers reading material translated from other languages.</p>
<p>By the late 1930s, the <a href="/wiki/Christian_countercult_movement" title="Christian countercult movement">Christian countercult movement</a> began applying the term <i>cult</i> to what would formerly have been termed <a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">heresy</a>. This usage became mainstream by the 1960s, via the best-selling <i><a href="/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_the_Cults" title="The Kingdom of the Cults">The Kingdom of the Cults</a></i> (1965). This terminological development, which had so far been characteristic of the <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States" title="Religion in the United States">religious sociology of the United States</a>, entered international use with the <a href="/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse" title="Satanic ritual abuse">"ritual abuse" moral panic</a> of the 1980s, which originated in the United States. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the <a href="/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse#International_spread" title="Satanic ritual abuse">international spread</a> throughout most of the <a href="/wiki/Anglosphere" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a> and some parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Also from the 1990s, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Political_correctness" title="Political correctness">discrimination discourse</a> at the height of the <a href="/wiki/Culture_war#United_States_of_America" title="Culture war">US "culture war"</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neopaganism_in_the_United_States" title="Neopaganism in the United States">US neopagan</a> religions, especially <a href="/wiki/Wicca" title="Wicca">Wicca</a>, began to protest through literature their classification as cults as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Discrimination_against_Neopagans" title="Discrimination against Neopagans">discriminatory</a>. Because of this usage of "cult" began to be discouraged in favour of the neutral <a href="/wiki/New_religious_movement" title="New religious movement">new religious movement</a> in sociological literature. Proponents of such an approach have sometimes been denounced as "procult apologists" by members of the anti-cult movement.</p>
<p>Most sociologists and scholars of religion also began to reject the word "cult" altogether because of its negative connotations in mass culture. Some began to advocate the use of new terms like "new religious movement", "alternative religion" or "novel religion" to describe most of the groups that had come to be referred to as "cults", yet none of these terms have had much success in popular culture or in the media. Other scholars have pushed to redeem the word "cult" as one fit for neutral academic discourse.</p>
<p>In a survey study containing 258 participants, negative perceptions of the terms "new religious movement", "cult" and "satanic cult" were found. However, these terms differed significantly (i.e., not due to chance) in how negatively the participants perceived them. "New religious movement" was found to be the most favourable term, followed by "cult" and then "Satanic cult".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scholarly_studies">Scholarly studies</span></h2>

<p>Sociologist <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> (1864–1920) found that cults based on <a href="/wiki/Charisma" title="Charisma">charismatic</a> leadership often follow the <a href="/wiki/Charismatic_authority#Routinizing_charisma" title="Charismatic authority">routinization of charisma</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a "cult" as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sociological_classifications_of_religious_movements" title="Sociological classifications of religious movements">sociological classification</a> was introduced in 1932 by American sociologist <a href="/wiki/Howard_P._Becker" title="Howard P. Becker">Howard P. Becker</a> as an expansion of German theologian <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Troeltsch" title="Ernst Troeltsch">Ernst Troeltsch</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sociological_classifications_of_religious_movements#Sociological_Church-Sect_typology" title="Sociological classifications of religious movements">church-sect typology</a>. Troeltsch's aim was to distinguish between three main types of religious behavior: churchly, <a href="/wiki/Sectarianism" title="Sectarianism">sectarian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mystical</a>. Becker created four categories out of Troeltsch's first two by splitting <i>church</i> into "<a href="/wiki/Christian_Church" title="Christian Church">ecclesia</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination" title="Religious denomination">denomination</a>", and <i>sect</i> into "<a href="/wiki/Sect" title="Sect">sect</a>" and "cult". Like Troeltsch's "mystical religion", Becker's cults were small religious groups lacking in organization and emphasizing the private nature of personal beliefs. Later sociological formulations built on these characteristics, placing an additional emphasis on cults as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deviant" title="Deviant">deviant</a> religious groups "deriving their inspiration from outside of the predominant religious culture". This is often thought to lead to a high degree of tension between the group and the more mainstream culture surrounding it, a characteristic shared with religious sects. In this sociological terminology, <i>sects</i> are products of religious <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Schism_(religion)" title="Schism (religion)">schism</a> and therefore maintain a continuity with <a href="/wiki/Tradition" title="Tradition">traditional</a> beliefs and practices, while <i>cults</i> arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, sociologist <a href="/wiki/John_Lofland_(sociologist)" title="John Lofland (sociologist)">John Lofland</a> lived with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/South_Korean" title="South Korean">South Korean</a> <a href="/wiki/Missionary" title="Missionary">missionary</a> <a href="/wiki/Young_Oon_Kim" title="Young Oon Kim">Young Oon Kim</a> and some of the first American <a href="/wiki/Unification_Church" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a> members in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, during which he studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships. Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: "The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes", and in 1966 in book form by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prentice-Hall" title="Prentice-Hall">Prentice-Hall</a> as <i><a href="/wiki/Doomsday_Cult:_A_Study_of_Conversion,_Proselytization,_and_Maintenance_of_Faith" title="Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith">Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization and Maintenance of Faith</a></i>. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion.</p>
<p>Sociologist <a href="/wiki/Roy_Wallis" title="Roy Wallis">Roy Wallis</a> (1945–1990) argued that a cult is characterized by "<a href="/wiki/Epistemology" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> individualism", meaning that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member". Cults, according to Wallis, are generally described as "oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant [and] non-exclusive", making "few demands on members", without possessing a "clear distinction between members and non-members", having "a rapid turnover of membership" and as being transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the "cultic milieu".</p>
<p>In 1978 Bruce Campbell noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Divine" title="Divine">divine</a> <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Element" title="Element">element</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Individual" title="Individual">individual</a>. This is sometimes called "<a href="/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Self" title="Self">self</a>", or "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/True_self" title="True self">true self</a>". Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized. Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention: One is <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mystical</a> and the other is instrumental. This can divide the cults into being either <a href="/wiki/Occult" title="Occult">occult</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metaphysical" title="Metaphysical">metaphysical</a> assemblies. On the basis that Campbell proposes about cults, they are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual. Other than the two main types, there is also a third type. This is service-oriented. Campbell states that "the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders." </p>

For the most part the effects seem to be positive in any way that's measurable."</p>
<p>In their 1996 book <i>Theory of Religion</i>, American sociologists <a href="/wiki/Rodney_Stark" title="Rodney Stark">Rodney Stark</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Sims_Bainbridge" title="William Sims Bainbridge">William Sims Bainbridge</a> propose that the formation of cults can be explained through the <a href="/wiki/Rational_choice_theory" title="Rational choice theory">rational choice theory</a>. In <i>The Future of Religion</i> they comment "...in the beginning, all religions are obscure, tiny, deviant cult movements". According to <a href="/wiki/Marc_Galanter_(psychiatrist)" title="Marc Galanter (psychiatrist)">Marc Galanter</a>, Professor of Psychiatry at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NYU" title="NYU">NYU</a>, typical reasons why people join cults include a search for community and a spiritual quest. Stark and Bainbridge, in discussing the process by which individuals join new religious groups, have even questioned the utility of the concept of <i>conversion</i>, suggesting that <i>affiliation</i> is a more useful concept.</p>

<p>In the 1940s, the long held opposition by some established Christian denominations to non-Christian religions and/or supposedly <a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">heretical</a>, or counterfeit, Christian sects crystallized into a more organized <a href="/wiki/Christian_countercult_movement" title="Christian countercult movement">Christian countercult movement</a> in the United States. For those belonging to the movement, all religious groups claiming to be Christian, but deemed outside of Christian <a href="/wiki/Orthodoxy" title="Orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a>, were considered cults. Christian cults are new religious movements which have a Christian background but are considered to be <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theologically</a> deviant by members of other Christian churches. In his influential book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_the_Cults" title="The Kingdom of the Cults">The Kingdom of the Cults</a></i> (first published in the United States in 1965), Christian scholar <a href="/wiki/Walter_Ralston_Martin" title="Walter Ralston Martin">Walter Martin</a> defines Christian cults as groups that follow the personal interpretation of an individual, rather than the understanding of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> accepted by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mainstream_Christianity" title="Mainstream Christianity">mainstream Christianity</a>. He mentions <a href="/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christian_Science" title="Christian Science">Christian Science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism" title="Unitarian Universalism">Unitarian Universalism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Unity_Church" title="Unity Church">Unity</a> as examples.</p>
<p>The Christian countercult movement asserts that Christian sects whose beliefs are partially or wholly not in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a cult if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> teachings such as <a href="/wiki/Salvation" title="Salvation">salvation</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> himself as a person, the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Jesus" title="Ministry of Jesus">ministry of Jesus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Miracles_of_Jesus" title="Miracles of Jesus">Miracles of Jesus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_of_Christ" title="Death of Christ">Death of Christ</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Resurrection_of_Christ" title="Resurrection of Christ">Resurrection of Christ</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Coming_of_Christ" title="Second Coming of Christ">Second Coming of Christ</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Rapture" title="Rapture">Rapture</a>.</p>

It presents a rebuttal by emphasizing the teachings of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> against the beliefs of non-fundamental Christian sects.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Secular_anti-cult_movement">Secular anti-cult movement</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Anti-cult_movement" title="Anti-cult movement">Anti-cult movement</a></div>
<p>In the early 1970s, a secular opposition movement to groups considered cults had taken shape. The organizations that formed the secular "<a href="/wiki/Anti-cult_movement" title="Anti-cult movement">anti-cult movement</a>" (ACM) often acted on behalf of relatives of "cult" <a href="/wiki/Religious_conversion" title="Religious conversion">converts</a> who did not believe their loved ones could have altered their lives so drastically by their own free will. A few <a href="/wiki/Psychologist" title="Psychologist">psychologists</a> and sociologists working in this field suggested that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brainwashing" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a> techniques were used to maintain the loyalty of cult members, while others rejected the idea. The belief that cults brainwashed their members became a unifying theme among cult critics and in the more extreme corners of the anti-cult movement techniques like the sometimes forceful "<a href="/wiki/Deprogramming" title="Deprogramming">deprogramming</a>" of cult members was practiced.</p>
<p>Secular cult opponents belonging to the anti-cult movement usually define a "cult" as a group that tends to manipulate, exploit, and control its members. Specific factors in cult behavior are said to include manipulative and authoritarian <a href="/wiki/Mind_control" title="Mind control">mind control</a> over members, <a href="/wiki/Commune" title="Commune">communal</a> and totalistic organization, aggressive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proselytizing" title="Proselytizing">proselytizing</a>, systematic programs of <a href="/wiki/Indoctrination" title="Indoctrination">indoctrination</a>, and perpetuation in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Middle-class" title="Middle-class">middle-class</a> communities. In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like <a href="/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brainwashing" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychological_abuse" title="Psychological abuse">psychological abuse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sexual_abuse" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Crime" title="Crime">criminal activity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mass_suicide" title="Mass suicide">mass suicide</a>. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law abiding it may be.</p>
<p>While some psychologists were receptive to these theories, sociologists were for the most part sceptical of their ability to explain conversion to <a href="/wiki/New_religious_movement" title="New religious movement">NRMs</a>. In the late 1980s, psychologists and sociologists started to abandon theories like brainwashing and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mind-control" title="Mind-control">mind-control</a>. While scholars may believe that various less dramatic <a href="/wiki/Coercion" title="Coercion">coercive</a> psychological mechanisms could influence group members, they came to see conversion to new religious movements principally as an act of a <a href="/wiki/Rational_choice_theory" title="Rational choice theory">rational choice</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactions_to_the_anti-cult_movements">Reactions to the anti-cult movements</span></h3>
<p>Because of the increasingly pejorative use of the words "cult" and "cult leader" since the cult debate of the 1970s, some academics, in addition to groups referred to as cults, argue that these are words to be avoided. <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Wessinger" title="Catherine Wessinger">Catherine Wessinger</a> (<a href="/wiki/Loyola_University_New_Orleans" title="Loyola University New Orleans">Loyola University New Orleans</a>) has stated that the word "cult" represents just as much prejudice and antagonism as racial slurs or derogatory words for women and homosexuals. She has argued that it is important for people to become aware of the bigotry conveyed by the word, drawing attention to the way it dehumanises the group's members and their children. Labeling a group as subhuman, she says, becomes a justification for violence against it. She also says that labeling a group a "cult" makes people feel safe, because the "violence associated with religion is split off from conventional religions, projected onto others, and imagined to involve only aberrant groups". This fails to take into account that child abuse, sexual abuse, financial extortion and warfare have also been committed by believers of mainstream religions, but the pejorative "cult" stereotype makes it easier to avoid confronting this uncomfortable fact.</p>
<p>Sociologist Amy Ryan has argued for the need to differentiate those groups that may be dangerous from groups that are more benign. Ryan notes the sharp differences between definition from cult opponents, who tend to focus on negative characteristics, and those of sociologists, who aim to create definitions that are value-free. The movements themselves may have different definitions of religion as well. <a href="/wiki/George_Chryssides" title="George Chryssides">George Chryssides</a> also cites a need to develop better definitions to allow for common ground in the debate. In <i>Defining Religion in American Law</i>, Bruce J. Casino presents the issue as crucial to international human rights laws. Limiting the definition of religion may interfere with freedom of religion, while too broad a definition may give some dangerous or abusive groups "a limitless excuse for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations".</p>

<p>A new religious movement (NRM) is a religious community or spiritual group of modern origins (since the mid-1800s), which has a peripheral place within its society's dominant religious culture. NRMs can be novel in origin or part of a wider religion, in which case they are distinct from pre-existing <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination" title="Religious denomination">denominations</a>. Scholars have estimated that NRMs, of which some but not all have been labelled as cults, number in the tens of thousands worldwide, most of which originated in Asia or Africa. The great majority have only a few members, some have thousands and only very few have more than a million. In 2007, religious scholar Elijah Siegler commented that, although no NRM had become the dominant faith in any country, many of the concepts which they had first introduced (often referred to as "<a href="/wiki/New_Age" title="New Age">New Age</a>" ideas) have become part of worldwide mainstream culture.</p>

It is also described as such by Tourish and Wohlforth in their writings. In his review of Tourish and Wohlforth's book, Bob Pitt, a former member of the WRP concedes that it had a "cult-like character" but argues that rather than being typical of the far left, this feature actually made the WRP atypical and "led to its being treated as a pariah within the revolutionary left itself". <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Workers%27_Struggle" title="Workers' Struggle">Workers' Struggle</a> (LO, <i>Lutte ouvrière</i>) in France, publicly headed by <a href="/wiki/Arlette_Laguiller" title="Arlette Laguiller">Arlette Laguiller</a> but revealed in the 1990s to be directed by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Barcia" title="Robert Barcia">Robert Barcia</a>, has often been criticized as a cult, for example by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Cohn-Bendit" title="Daniel Cohn-Bendit">Daniel Cohn-Bendit</a> and his older brother Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, as well as <i><a href="/wiki/L%27Humanit%C3%A9" title="L'Humanité">L'Humanité</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Lib%C3%A9ration" title="Libération">Libération</a></i>.</p>
<p>In his book <i>Les Sectes Politiques: 1965–1995</i> (translation: <i>Political cults: 1965–1995</i>), French writer Cyril Le Tallec considered some religious groups as cults involved in politics, including the <a href="/wiki/League_for_Catholic_Counter-Reformation" title="League for Catholic Counter-Reformation">League for Catholic Counter-Reformation</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Office_of_Cluny" title="Cultural Office of Cluny">Cultural Office of Cluny</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Acropolis" title="New Acropolis">New Acropolis</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/S%C5%8Dka_Gakkai" title="Sōka Gakkai">Sōka Gakkai</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Divine_Light_Mission" title="Divine Light Mission">Divine Light Mission</a>, <a href="/wiki/American_Society_for_the_Defense_of_Tradition,_Family_and_Property" title="American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property">Tradition Family Property (TFP)</a>, Longo-Mai, the Supermen Club and the Association for Promotion of the Industrial Arts (Solazaref).</p>
<p>In 1990 Lucy Patrick commented: "Although we live in a democracy, cult behavior manifests itself in our unwillingness to question the judgment of our leaders, our tendency to devalue outsiders and to avoid dissent. We can overcome cult behavior, he says, by recognizing that we have dependency needs that are inappropriate for mature people, by increasing anti-authoritarian education, and by encouraging personal autonomy and the free exchange of ideas."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Destructive_cults">Destructive cults</span></h2>

<p>"Destructive cult" has generally referred to groups whose members have, through deliberate action, physically injured or killed other members of their own group or other people. The <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Consultants_on_Religious_Tolerance" title="Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance">Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance</a> limit use of the term to specifically refer to religious groups that "have caused or are liable to cause loss of life among their membership or the general public". <a href="/wiki/Psychologist" title="Psychologist">Psychologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Michael_Langone" title="Michael Langone">Michael Langone</a>, executive director of the anti-cult group <a href="/wiki/International_Cultic_Studies_Association" title="International Cultic Studies Association">International Cultic Studies Association</a>, defines a destructive cult as "a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically and/or psychologically damages members and recruits".</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_Gordon_Clark" title="John Gordon Clark">John Gordon Clark</a> cited <a href="/wiki/Totalitarianism" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> systems of governance and an emphasis on money making as characteristics of a destructive cult. In <i>Cults and the Family</i> the authors cite Shapiro, who defines a "destructive cultism" as a <a href="/wiki/Psychopathy" title="Psychopathy">sociopathic</a> <a href="/wiki/Syndrome" title="Syndrome">syndrome</a>, whose distinctive qualities include: "behavioral and personality changes, loss of personal identity, cessation of scholastic activities, estrangement from family, disinterest in society and pronounced mental control and enslavement by cult leaders".</p>
<p>In the opinion of <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Zablocki" title="Benjamin Zablocki">Benjamin Zablocki</a>, a Professor of Sociology at <a href="/wiki/Rutgers_University" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers University</a>, destructive cults are at high risk of becoming abusive to members. He states that this is in part due to members' adulation of <a href="/wiki/Charismatic_authority" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> leaders contributing to the leaders becoming corrupted by power. According to Barrett, the most common accusation made against destructive cults is <a href="/wiki/Sexual_abuse" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Reender_Kranenborg" title="Reender Kranenborg">Kranenborg</a>, some groups are risky when they advise their members not to use regular medical care.</p>
<p>Some researchers have criticized the usage of the term "destructive cult", writing that it is used to describe groups which are not necessarily harmful in nature to themselves or others. In his book <i>Understanding New Religious Movements</i>, John A. Saliba writes that the term is overgeneralized. Saliba sees the <a href="/wiki/Peoples_Temple" title="Peoples Temple">Peoples Temple</a> as the "paradigm of a destructive cult", where those that use the term are implying that other groups will also commit <a href="/wiki/Mass_suicide" title="Mass suicide">mass suicide</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in the book <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Misunderstanding_Cults_(book)" title="Misunderstanding Cults (book)">Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field</a></i>, contributor Julius H. Rubin complains that the term has been used to discredit certain groups in the <a href="/wiki/Public_opinion" title="Public opinion">court of public opinion</a>. In his work <i>Cults in Context</i> author Lorne L. Dawson writes that although the <a href="/wiki/Unification_Church" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a> "has not been shown to be violent or volatile", it has been described as a destructive cult by "anticult crusaders".

<p>Cults that teach and practice <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a>, marriage between more than two people, most often <a href="/wiki/Polygyny" title="Polygyny">polygyny</a>, one man having multiple wives, have long been noted, although they are a minority. It has been estimated that there are around 50,000 members of polygamist cults in North America. Often polygamist cults are viewed negatively by legal authorities and by society, sometimes including related mainstream denominations, because of perceived links to possible domestic abuse and child abuse.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>, authorities have prosecuted the leaders of at least two polygamist cults. Goel Ratzon was living with 32 women and more than 89 children in <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. He was sentenced to 30 years in jail for sex offences against minors under the age of 16. He was acquitted of the offense of holding women in slavery. The State argued that in polygamous cults, slavery can be extended to "mental slavery", by way of mind control. The Tel Aviv District Court found that the theory of mind control is not universally accepted. The Jerusalem Police arrested Daniel Ambash, a Frenchman living with 6 women and 17 children. All of the women and children were begging for money in the streets of Jersalem. He was sentenced to 26 years in prison for rape and child abuse. It was argued that the women who remained loyal to him suffer from a shared psychosis of <a href="/wiki/Folie_%C3%A0_deux" title="Folie à deux">Folie à deux</a>.</p>

<p>Former <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" title="People's Mujahedin of Iran">Mujaheddin</a> member and now author and academic Dr. Masoud Banisadr stated in a May 2005 speech in Spain :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you ask me: are all cults a terrorist organisation? My answer is no, as there are many peaceful cults at present around the world and in the history of mankind. But if you ask me are all terrorist organisations some sort of cult, my answer is yes. Even if they start as [an] ordinary modern political party or organisation, to prepare and force their members to act without asking any moral questions and act selflessly for the cause of the group and ignore all the ethical, cultural, moral or religious codes of the society and humanity, those organisations have to change into a cult. Therefore to understand an extremist or a terrorist organisation one has to learn about a Cult.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regional_developments">Regional developments</span></h2>

<p>Sociologists critical to this negative politicized use of the word "cult" argue that it may adversely impact the religious freedoms of group members. In the 1980s clergymen and officials of the French government expressed concern that some <a href="/wiki/Religious_order" title="Religious order">orders</a> and other groups within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> would be adversely affected by anti-cult laws then being considered.</p>
<p>The application of the labels "cult" or "sect" to religious movements in government documents signifies the popular and negative use of the term "cult" in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/English_(language)" title="English (language)">English</a> and a functionally similar use of words translated as "sect" in several European languages. While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria. Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe the groups.</p>
<p>At the height of the counter-cult movement and ritual abuse scare of the 1990s, some governments published <a href="/wiki/Governmental_lists_of_cults_and_sects" title="Governmental lists of cults and sects">lists of cults</a>. Since the 2000s, some governments have again distanced themselves from such classifications of religious movements.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="USA">USA</span></h3>
<p>In the 1970s, the scientific status of the "<a href="/wiki/Mind_control" title="Mind control">brainwashing theory</a>" became a central topic in U.S. court cases where the theory was used to try to justify the use of the forceful <a href="/wiki/Deprogramming" title="Deprogramming">deprogramming</a> of cult members. Meanwhile, sociologists critical of these theories assisted advocates of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_freedom" title="Religious freedom">religious freedom</a> in defending the legitimacy of new religious movements in court. While the official response to new religious groups has been mixed across the globe, some governments aligned more with the critics of these groups to the extent of distinguishing between "legitimate" religion and "dangerous", "unwanted" cults in <a href="/wiki/Public_policy" title="Public policy">public policy</a>.</p>
<p>In the United States religious activities of cults are protected under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_Amendment_of_the_United_States_Constitution" title="First Amendment of the United States Constitution">First Amendment of the United States Constitution</a>, which prohibits governmental <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Establishment_of_religion" title="Establishment of religion">establishment of religion</a> and protects <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" title="Freedom of religion">freedom of religion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press" title="Freedom of the press">freedom of the press</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly" title="Freedom of assembly">freedom of assembly</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Europe">Europe</span></h3>
<p>An anti-cult movement comparable to the one in the United States originated in <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_Russia" title="Religion in Russia">Russia</a> in the 1990s. In 2008, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_Interior_Ministry" title="Russian Interior Ministry">Russian Interior Ministry</a> prepared a list of "extremist groups", which included groups adhering to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Militant_Islamism" title="Militant Islamism">militant Islamism</a> and "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neopaganism_in_Russia" title="Neopaganism in Russia">Pagan cults</a>".</p>

<p>France and Belgium have taken policy positions which accept "brainwashing" theories uncritically, while other European nations, like Sweden and Italy, are cautious about brainwashing and have adopted more neutral responses to new religions. Scholars have suggested that outrage following the mass murder/suicides perpetuated by the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Solar_Temple" title="Order of the Solar Temple">Solar Temple</a> as well as the more latent xenophobic and anti-American attitudes have contributed significantly to the extremity of European anti-cult positions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="China">China</span></h3>
<p>For centuries, governments in China have categories certain religions as <i>xiejiao</i> (<a href="/wiki/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh">邪教</span>; <a href="/wiki/Pinyin" title="Pinyin">pinyin</a>: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xiéjiào</span></i>) – sometimes translated as "evil cult" or as "heterodox teaching". In imperial China, the classification of a religion as <i>xiejiao</i> did not necessarily mean that a religion’s teachings were believed to be false or inauthentic, but rather, the label was applied to religious groups that were not authorized by the state, or that were seen as challenging the legitimacy of the state. In modern China, the term <i>xiejiao</i> continues to be used to denote teachings that the government disapproves of, and these groups face suppression and punishment by authorities. Fourteen different groups in China have been listed by the ministry of public security as <i>xiejiao</i>. In addition, in 1999, Chinese authorities denounced the <a href="/wiki/Falun_Gong" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> spiritual practice as a heretical teaching, and began a campaign to eliminate it. According to <a href="/wiki/Amnesty_International" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong" title="Persecution of Falun Gong">persecution of Falun Gong</a> includes a multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, as well as a variety of extralegal coercive measures, such as arbitrary arrests, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forced_labour" title="Forced labour">forced labour</a>, and physical <a href="/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a>, sometimes resulting in death. The Chinese government has sought to legitimize its treatment of Falun Gong by adopting the language of the Western anti-cult movement, but Western scholars familiar with the group say that Falun Gong does not meet the definition of a cult.</p>
