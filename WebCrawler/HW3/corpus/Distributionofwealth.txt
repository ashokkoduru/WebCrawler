<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_of_wealth">Definition of wealth</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">Wealth</a></div>
<p>Wealth in the context of this article is defined as a person's net worth, expressed as:</p>

<p>The word <i>wealth</i> is often confused with <i><a href="/wiki/Income" title="Income">income</a></i>. These two terms describe different but related things. Wealth consists of those items of economic value that an individual owns, while income is an <i>inflow</i> of items of economic value. (See <a href="/wiki/Stock_and_flow" title="Stock and flow">Stock and flow</a>.) The relation between wealth, income, and expenses is:</p>

<p>The distribution of income is substantially different from the distribution of wealth. According to the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth, "the world distribution of wealth is much more unequal than that of income."</p>
<p>If an individual has a large income but also large expenses, the net effect of that income on her or his wealth could be small or even negative.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> definition of <i>inclusive wealth</i> is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human and physical assets.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Data_about_global_distribution_of_wealth">Data about global distribution of wealth</span></h2>

<p>The vast and growing gap between rich and poor has been laid bare. The gap between the rich and poor can be illustrated by the fact that the three wealthiest individuals in the world have assets that exceed those of the poorest 10 percent of the world's population. The net worth of <a href="/wiki/Billionaire" title="Billionaire">the world's billionaires</a> increased from less than $1 trillion in 2000 to over $7 trillion in 2015 so the gap is growing up dramatically. Statistics shows 28.4 million slaves at the end of 2006 was living in the world with zero wealth. The right hand-side fig shows <a href="/wiki/Millionaire" title="Millionaire">millionaires</a> as 1 percent of the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world population</a> who possess more than half of global wealth.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wealth_distribution_pyramid">Wealth distribution pyramid</span></h3>
<p>Personal wealth varies across adults for many reasons. Some individuals with little wealth may be at early stages in their careers, with little chance or motivation to accumulate assets. Others may have suffered business setbacks or personal misfortunes, or live in parts of the world where opportunities for wealth creation are severely limited. At the other end of the spectrum, there are individuals who have acquired a large fortune through a combination of talent, hard work or simply being in the right place at the right time. The wealth pyramid below was prepared by <a href="/wiki/Credit_Suisse" title="Credit Suisse">Credit Suisse</a> in 2013; it captures these differences in striking detail. It has a large base of low wealth holders, alongside upper tiers occupied by progressively fewer people. In 2013 Credit-suisse estimate that 3.2 billion individuals – more than two thirds of adults in the world – have wealth below 10,000 USD. A further one billion(adult population) fall within the 10,000 – 100,000 USD range. While the average wealth holding is modest in the base and middle segments of the pyramid, their total wealth amounts to USD 40 trillion, underlining the potential for novel consumer products and innovative financial services targeted at this often neglected segment.</p>
<p>The pyramid reveals that:</p>
<ul>
<li>half of the world's wealth belongs to the top 1%,</li>
<li>top 10% of adults hold 85%, while the bottom 90% hold the remaining 15% of the world's total wealth,</li>
<li>top 30% of adults hold 97% of the total wealth.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wealth_distribution_in_2012">Wealth distribution in 2012</span></h4>
<p>According to the OECD in 2012 the top 0.6% of world population (consisting of adults with more than 1 million USD in assets) or the 42 million richest people in the world held 39.3% of world wealth. The next 4.4% (311 million people) held 32.3% of world wealth. The bottom 95% held 28.4% of world wealth. The large gaps of the report get by the Gini index to 0.893, and are larger than gaps in global income inequality, measured in 2009 at 0.38. For example, in 2012 the bottom 60% of the world population held same wealth in 2012 as the people on Forbes' Richest list consisting of 1,226 richest billionaires of the world.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statistical_distributions">Statistical distributions</span></h2>
<p>There are many ways in which the distribution of wealth can be analyzed. One example is to compare the wealth of the richest one percent with the wealth of the median (or 50th) percentile. In many societies, the richest ten percent control more than half of the total wealth.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Pareto_distribution" title="Pareto distribution">Pareto Distribution</a></i> has often been used to mathematically quantify the distribution of wealth, since it models a random distribution.</p>
<p><i>Wealth over people (WOP) curves</i> are a visually compelling way to show the distribution of wealth in a nation. WOP curves are modified distribution of wealth curves. The vertical and horizontal scales each show percentages from zero to one hundred. We imagine all the households in a nation being sorted from richest to poorest. They are then shrunk down and lined up (richest at the left) along the horizontal scale. For any particular household, its point on the curve represents how their wealth compares (as a proportion) to the average wealth of the richest percentile. For any nation, the average wealth of the richest 1/100 of households is the topmost point on the curve (people, 1%; wealth, 100%) or (p=1, w=100) or (1, 100). In the real world two points on the WOP curve are always known before any statistics are gathered. These are the topmost point (1, 100) by definition, and the rightmost point (poorest people, lowest wealth) or (p=100, w=0) or (100, 0). This unfortunate rightmost point is given because there are always at least one percent of households (incarcerated, long term illness, etc.) with no wealth at all. Given that the topmost and rightmost points are fixed … our interest lies in the form of the WOP curve between them. There are two extreme possible forms of the curve. The first is the "perfect communist" WOP. It is a straight line from the leftmost (maximum wealth) point horizontally across the people scale to p=99. Then it drops vertically to wealth = 0 at (p=100, w=0).</p>
<p>The other extreme is the "perfect tyranny" form. It starts on the left at the Tyrant's maximum wealth of 100%. It then immediately drops to zero at p=2, and continues at zero horizontally across the rest of the people. That is, the tyrant and his friends (the top percentile) own all the nation's wealth. All other citizens are serfs or slaves. An obvious intermediate form is a straight line connecting the left/top point to the right/bottom point. In such a "Diagonal" society a household in the richest percentile would have just twice the wealth of a family in the median (50th) percentile. Such a society is compelling to many (especially the poor). In fact it is a comparison to a diagonal society that is the basis for the <a href="/wiki/Gini_coefficient" title="Gini coefficient">Gini values</a> used as a measure of the disequity in a particular economy. These Gini values (40.8 in 2007) show the United States to be the third most dis-equitable economy of all the developed nations (behind Denmark and Switzerland). The US WOP Curve is shown below. As you will see it approaches the "tyrant's curve".</p>
<p>A curve that is visually appealing is the <i>quarter-circle curve</i> or the <i>wagon wheel WOP</i>. Some reformers feel that any nation's tax system should be set up so that its WOP never gets sucked in beyond the wagon wheel form.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models have also been proposed.</p>

<p>In many societies, attempts have been made, through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Property_redistribution" title="Property redistribution">property redistribution</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taxation" title="Taxation">taxation</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulation</a>, to redistribute wealth, sometimes in support of the upper class, and sometimes to diminish extreme <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">inequality</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of this practice go back at least to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_republic" title="Roman republic">Roman republic</a> in the third century B.C., when laws were passed limiting the amount of wealth or land that could be owned by any one family. Motivations for such limitations on wealth include the desire for equality of opportunity, a fear that great wealth leads to political corruption, to the belief that limiting wealth will gain the political favor of a <a href="/wiki/Voting_bloc" title="Voting bloc">voting bloc</a>, or fear that extreme concentration of wealth results in rebellion. Various forms of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a> attempt to diminish the unequal distribution of wealth and thus the conflicts and social problems (see image below) arising from it.</p>

<p>A study by the <a href="/wiki/World_Institute_for_Development_Economics_Research" title="World Institute for Development Economics Research">World Institute for Development Economics Research</a> at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000, and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total.

<p>According to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PolitiFact" title="PolitiFact">PolitiFact</a> and others, in 2011 the 400 wealthiest Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined." <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inherited_wealth" title="Inherited wealth">Inherited wealth</a> may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start". In September 2012, according to the <a href="/wiki/Institute_for_Policy_Studies" title="Institute for Policy Studies">Institute for Policy Studies</a>, "over 60 percent" of the <a href="/wiki/Forbes_400" title="Forbes 400">Forbes richest 400 Americans</a> "grew up in substantial privilege".</p>
<p>In 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth (excluding human capital), and the next 19% owned 50.5%. The top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%. From 1922 to 2010, the share of the top 1% varied from 19.7% to 44.2%, the big drop being associated with the drop in the stock market in the late 1970s. Ignoring the period where the stock market was depressed (1976–1980) and the period when the stock market was overvalued (1929), the share of wealth of the richest 1% remained extremely stable, at about a third of the total wealth. Financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%. However, after the <a href="/wiki/Great_Recession" title="Great Recession">Great Recession</a> which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_1%25" title="The 1%">the 1%</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_99%25" title="The 99%">the 99%</a>. During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dan_Ariely" title="Dan Ariely">Dan Ariely</a> and Michael Norton show in a study (2011) that US citizens across the political spectrum significantly underestimate the current US wealth inequality and would prefer a more egalitarian distribution of wealth, raising questions about ideological disputes over issues like taxation and welfare.</p>
