<p><b>World energy consumption</b> is the total <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> used by all of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_civilization" title="Human civilization">human civilization</a>. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_source" title="Energy source">energy source</a> applied towards humanity's endeavors across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. Being the power source metric of civilization, World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanity's social-economic-political sphere.</p>
<p>Institutions such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA), the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), and the <a href="/wiki/European_Environment_Agency" title="European Environment Agency">European Environment Agency</a> record and publish energy data periodically. Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns, which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions.</p>
<p>The IEA estimates that, in 2013, total world energy consumption was 9,301 <a href="/wiki/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent" title="Tonne of oil equivalent">Mtoe</a> , or 3.89 × 10 <a href="/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">joules</a>, equal to an average power consumption of 12.3 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Terawatts" title="Terawatts">terawatts</a>. From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydro power and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period, which can possibly be explained by an increase in international investment in renewable energy. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, possibly due to the accidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.</p>
<p>In 2011, expenditures on energy totaled over 6 trillion USD, or about 10% of the world <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP).

<p>World <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Total_primary_energy_supply" title="Total primary energy supply">total primary energy supply</a> (TPES), or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers. For instance, when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline, so that it can be used in a car, and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers. World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity. In 2012, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,505 terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,371 <a href="/wiki/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent" title="Tonne of oil equivalent">Mtoe</a>, while the world final energy consumption was 104,426 TWh or about 32% less than the total supply. World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use amounted to 9,404 TWh (809 Mtoe) in 2012.</p>
<p>The world's electricity consumption was 18,608 TWh in 2012. This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants (<a href="/wiki/Gross_generation" title="Gross generation">gross generation</a>). <a href="/wiki/Cogeneration" title="Cogeneration">Cogeneration</a> (CHP) power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes.</p>

<p>The United States <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources. The most recent estimate of the world energy consumption was 5.67 × 10 joules, or 157,481 TWh, in 2013. According to the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">IEA</a> the total world energy consumption was 143,851 TWh in 2008, 133,602 TWh in 2005, 117,687 TWh in 2000, and 102,569 TWh in 1990. Total world electricity consumption was 19,504 TWh in 2013, 16,503 TWh in 2008, 15,105 TWh in 2005, and 12,116 TWh in 2000. In 2012 approximately 22% of world energy was consumed in North America, 5% was consumed South and Central America, 23% was consumed in Europe and Eurasia, 3% was consumed in Africa, and 40% was consumed in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>In 2013, world energy consumption by power source was oil 31.1%, coal 28.9%, natural gas 21.4%, biofuels and waste 10.2%, nuclear 4.8%, hydro 2.4%, and 'other' (solar, wind, geothermal, heat, etc.) 1.2%. Oil, coal, and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels.</p>
<p>Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas. One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.</p>

<div style="clear:left;"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trends">Trends</span></h3>



<p>The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth. For several years now, the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets, while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies, high oil prices, resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">IEA</a> data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the EU-27 block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.</p>
<p>In 2008, total worldwide energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TWh" title="TWh">TWh</a>) or 474 exajoules (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exajoules" title="Exajoules">EJ</a>). This corresponds to an average global power demand of 15 terawatts (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Terawatt" title="Terawatt">TW</a>). In 2012, energy demand increased to 158,000 TWh (567 EJ), equivalent to an average power use of 18.0 TW.</p>
<p>Energy consumption in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Group_of_Twenty_Finance_Ministers_and_Central_Bank_Governors" title="Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors">G20</a> increased by more than 5% in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. In 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1%, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent (<a href="/wiki/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent" title="Tonne of oil equivalent">Mtoe</a>), as a result of the financial and economic crisis, which reduced world GDP by 0.6% in 2009.</p>
<p>This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (+4%). Conversely, in OECD, consumption was severely cut by 4.7% in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels. In North America, Europe and the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" title="Commonwealth of Independent States">CIS</a>, consumptions shrank by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5% respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity. China became the world's largest energy consumer (18% of the total) since its consumption surged by 8% during 2009 (up from 4% in 2008). Oil remained the largest energy source (33%) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time. Coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009, it accounted for 27% of the total.</p>
<p>Most energy is used in the country of origin, since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials. In 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50% (1,952/3,941 Mt), gas 25% (800/3,149 bcm) and hard coal 14% (793/5,845 Mt).</p>
<p>Most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter <i>(see <a href="/wiki/Solar_constant" title="Solar constant">solar constant</a>)</i>, though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy#Energy_from_the_Sun" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> received by the planet; about half, 89,000 TW, reaches the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4  yottajoule (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yottajoule" title="Yottajoule">YJ</a>) or 4 × 10 joules, and the available nuclear fuel such as <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> exceeding 2.5 YJ. Fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3 YJ if estimates of reserves of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methane_clathrates" title="Methane clathrates">methane clathrates</a> are accurate and become technically extractable. The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 5.5 YJ per year, though not all of this is available for human consumption. The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of $48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks."</p>
<p>According to IEA (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2 °C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If action is not taken before 2017, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. Fossil fuels are dominant in the global <a href="/wiki/Energy_mix" title="Energy mix">energy mix</a>, supported by $523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30% on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.</p>

Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, thought to be a risk by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stockholm_Environmental_Institute" title="Stockholm Environmental Institute">SEI</a>, is now doubtful.</p>
<p>To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050. Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to <a href="/wiki/Robert_Engelman" title="Robert Engelman">Robert Engelman</a> (Worldwatch institute), in order to prevent collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gases">Greenhouse gases</a> are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption. Large amounts of pollutants such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sulphurous_oxide" title="Sulphurous oxide">sulphurous oxides</a> (SO<sub>x</sub>), <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxides</a> (NO<sub>x</sub>), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Particulate_matter" title="Particulate matter">particulate matter</a> (PM) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" title="World Health Organisation">World Health Organisation</a> estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>. <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">Biomass</a> <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a> is a major contributor, even though it is typically counted as <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable</a> in energy statistics.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">Fossil fuel</a></div>
<p>The twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels. Between 1980 and 2006, the worldwide annual growth rate was 2%. According to the US <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a>'s 2006 estimate, the estimated 471.8 EJ total consumption in 2004, was divided as given in the table above, with fossil fuels supplying 86% of the world's energy:</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Coal">Coal</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">Coal</a></div>
<p>In 2000, China accounted for 28% of world coal consumption, other Asia consumed 19%, North America 25% and the EU 14%. The single greatest coal-consuming country is China. Its share of the world coal production was 28% in 2000 and rose to 48% in 2009. In contrast to China's ~70% increase in coal consumption, world coal use increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia. China's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector, the majority of which comes from coal consumption.</p>
<p>World annual coal production increased 1,905 Mt or 32% in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70% was in China and 8% in India. Coal production was in 2011 7,783 Mt, and 2009 6,903 Mt, equal to 12.7% production increase in two years.</p>
<p>If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions in the world. According to IEA Coal Information (2007) world production and use of coal have increased considerably in recent years. According to <a href="/wiki/James_Hansen" title="James Hansen">James Hansen</a> the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">coal</a>. <a href="/wiki/Energy_in_Indonesia" title="Energy in Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Energy_in_Australia" title="Energy in Australia">Australia</a> exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Oil">Oil</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">Petroleum</a></div>
<p>Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, airplanes and the spreading use of electricity, <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">oil</a> became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of <a href="/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" title="1973 oil crisis">1973</a> and <a href="/wiki/1979_energy_crisis" title="1979 energy crisis">1979</a>, during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil. Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world. From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.</p>
<p>It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.</p>

<p>In 2009, the world use of natural gas was 131% compared to year 2000. 66% of this growth was outside EU, North America Latin America and Russia. Others include Middle East, Asia and Africa. The gas supply increased also in the previous regions: 8.6% in the EU and 16% in the North America 2000–2009.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_Power" title="Nuclear Power">Nuclear Power</a></div>
<p>As of 1 July 2016, the world had 444 operable grid-electric nuclear power reactors with 62 others under construction. Since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid 1950s, 2008 was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid, although two were connected in 2009.</p>
<p>Annual generation of nuclear power has been on a slight downward trend since 2007, decreasing 1.8% in 2009 to 2558 TWh, and another 1.6% in 2011 to 2518 TWh, despite increases in production from most countries worldwide, because those increases were more than offset by decreases in Germany and Japan.

<p>Based on <a href="/wiki/REN21" title="REN21">REN21</a>'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China" title="Renewable energy in China">China</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States" title="Renewable energy in the United States">United States</a> heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels. Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> is resulting in significant <a href="/wiki/Energy_security_and_renewable_technology" title="Energy security and renewable technology">energy security</a>, <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">climate change mitigation</a>, and economic benefits. In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> projected that solar power could provide "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would be reduced to very low levels." Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Passive_solar" title="Passive solar">passive solar</a> or <a href="/wiki/Active_solar" title="Active solar">active solar</a> depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_system" title="Photovoltaic system">photovoltaic systems</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_collector" title="Solar thermal collector">solar thermal collectors</a> to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable <a href="/wiki/Thermal_mass" title="Thermal mass">thermal mass</a> or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that <a href="/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)" title="Ventilation (architecture)">naturally circulate air</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Geothermal_energy" title="Geothermal energy">Geothermal energy</a> is used commercially in over 70 countries. In 2004, 200 petajoules (56 TWh) of electricity was generated from geothermal resources, and an additional 270 petajoules (75 TWh) of geothermal energy was used directly, mostly for space heating. In 2007, the world had a global capacity for <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7010100000000000000♠</span>10 GW</span> of electricity generation and an additional <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7010280000000000000♠</span>28 GW</span> of <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_heating" title="Geothermal heating">direct heating</a>, including extraction by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pumps" title="Geothermal heat pumps">geothermal heat pumps</a>.

<p>Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a> sources was estimated at 44 GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220 GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264 GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded. World production of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">bioethanol</a> increased by 8% in 2005 to reach 33 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigalitre" title="Gigalitre">gigalitres</a> (8.7<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_gallon" title="US gallon">US gal</a>), with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil. <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">Biodiesel</a> increased by 85% to 3.9 gigalitres (1.0<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 US gal), making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005.

<p>Energy consumption is loosely correlated with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gross_National_Product#Gross_National_Product" title="Gross National Product">gross national product</a> and climate, but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries, such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6 kW per person and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_use_in_the_United_States" title="Energy use in the United States">United States</a> with an energy consumption rate of 11.4 kW per person. In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7 kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2 kW per person.</p>
<p>The US consumes 25% of the world's energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.59%. The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (19.6% of the world population) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6 kW per person.</p>
<p>One measurement of efficiency is <a href="/wiki/Energy_intensity" title="Energy intensity">energy intensity</a>. This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="By_sector">By sector</span></h2>

<p>Industrial users (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction) consume about 37% of the total 15 TW. Personal and commercial transportation consumes 20%; residential heating, lighting, and appliances use 11%; and commercial uses (lighting, heating and cooling of commercial buildings, and provision of water and sewer services) amount to 5% of the total.</p>
<p>The other 27% of the world's energy is lost in energy transmission and generation. In 2005, global electricity consumption averaged 2 TW. The energy rate used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%. The new generation of gas-fired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55%. Coal is the most common fuel for the world's electricity plants.</p>
<p>Total world energy use per sector was in 2008 industry 28%, transport 27% and residential and service 36%. Division was about the same in the year 2000.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="European_Union">European Union</span></h3>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Environmental_Agency" title="European Environmental Agency">European Environmental Agency</a> (EEA) measures final energy consumption (does not include energy used in production and lost in transportation) and finds that the transport sector is responsible for 31.8% of final energy consumption, households 26.2%, industry 25.6%, <a href="/wiki/Service_(economics)" title="Service (economics)">services</a> 13.5% and agriculture 2.9% in 2012. The use of energy is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (79%), with the energy sector representing 31%, transport 19%, industry 13%, households 9% and others 7%.</p>
<p>While <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">efficient energy use</a> and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coal_plants" title="Coal plants">coal plants</a> in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40%. Technological developments in the 1990s have allowed efficiencies in the range of 40–45% at newer plants. However, according to an impact assessment by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, this is still below the best available technological (BAT) efficiency levels of 46–49%. With <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas-fired_power_plant" title="Gas-fired power plant">gas-fired power plants</a> the average efficiency is 52% compared to 58–59% with best available technology (BAT), and gas and oil <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boiler_(steam_generator)" title="Boiler (steam generator)">boiler plants</a> operate at average 36% efficiency (BAT delivers 47%). According to that same impact assessment by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, raising the efficiency of all new plants and the majority of existing plants, through the setting of authorisation and permit conditions, to an average generation efficiency of 51.5% in 2020 would lead to a reduction in annual consumption of 15 km (3.6 cu mi) of natural gas and 25 Mt (25,000,000 long tons; 28,000,000 short tons) of coal.</p>
