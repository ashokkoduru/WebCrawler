<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WBCSD.27s_10_messages_by_which_to_operate">WBCSD's 10 messages by which to operate</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Business" title="Business">Business</a> is good for sustainable development and sustainable development is good for business.</i> Business is part of the sustainable development solution, while sustainable development is an effective long-term business growth strategy.</li>
<li><i>Business cannot succeed in societies that fail.</i> There is no future for successful business if the societies that surround it are not working. Governments and business must create partnerships to deliver essential societal services like energy, water, health care and infrastructure.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">Poverty</a> is a key enemy to stable societies.</i> Poverty creates political and economic instability, a big threat to business and sustainable development. By contrast, businesses can lift living standards and eradicate poverty.</li>
<li><i>Access to markets for all supports sustainable development.</i> Sustainable development is best achieved through open, transparent and competitive global markets.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Good_governance" title="Good governance">Good governance</a> is needed to make business a part of the solution.</i> Supportive frameworks and regulations are needed for business to contribute fully to sustainable development.</li>
<li><i>Business has to earn its licence to operate, innovate and grow.</i> The way business acts and is perceived is crucial to its success. Accountability, ethics, transparency, social and environmental responsibility and trust are basic prerequisites for successful business and sustainable development.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Innovation" title="Innovation">Innovation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Technology_development" title="Technology development">technology development</a> are crucial to sustainable development.</i> They provide key solutions to many of the problems that threaten sustainable development. Business has always been, and will continue to be, the main contributor to technological development.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Eco-efficiency" title="Eco-efficiency">Eco-efficiency</a> – doing more with less - is at the core of the business case for sustainable development.</i> Combining environmental and economic operational excellence to deliver goods and services with lower external impacts and higher quality-of-life benefits is a key sustainable development strategy for business.</li>
<li><i>Ecosystems in balance – a prerequisite for business.</i> Business cannot function if ecosystems and the services they deliver, such as water, biodiversity, food, fiber and climate, are degraded.</li>
<li><i>Cooperation beats confrontation.</i> Sustainable development challenges are huge and require contributions from all parties — governments, business, civil societies and international bodies. Confrontation puts the solutions at risk. Cooperation and creative partnerships foster sustainable development.</li>
