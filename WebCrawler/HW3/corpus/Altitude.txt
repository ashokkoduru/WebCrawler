<p><b>Altitude</b> or <b>height</b> (sometimes known as <b>depth</b>) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or "up" direction, between a reference <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Datum_(geodesy)" title="Datum (geodesy)">datum</a> and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Height_above_sea_level" title="Height above sea level">height above sea level</a> of a location, in <a href="/wiki/Geography" title="Geography">geography</a> the term <a href="/wiki/Elevation" title="Elevation">elevation</a> is often preferred for this usage.</p>
<p>Vertical distance measurements in the "down" direction are commonly referred to as <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/depth" title="wikt:depth">depth</a>.</p>

<p>In aviation, the term altitude can have several meanings, and is always qualified by either explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. "true altitude"), or implicitly through the context of the communication. Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used.</p>
<p>Aviation altitude is measured using either <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mean_sea_level" title="Mean sea level">mean sea level</a> (MSL) or local ground level (above ground level, or AGL) as the reference datum.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pressure_altitude" title="Pressure altitude">Pressure altitude</a> divided by 100 feet (30 m) as the <a href="/wiki/Flight_level" title="Flight level">flight level</a>, and is used above the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transition_altitude" title="Transition altitude">transition altitude</a> (18,000 feet (5,500 m) in the US, but may be as low as 3,000 feet (910 m) in other jurisdictions); so when the altimeter reads 18,000 ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at "Flight level 180". When flying at a flight level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inches_of_mercury" title="Inches of mercury">inHg</a> or 1013.25 <a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" title="Pascal (unit)">hPa</a>).</p>
<p>On the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure <a href="/wiki/Altimeter" title="Altimeter">altimeter</a>, which is an <a href="/wiki/Barometer#Aneroid_barometers" title="Barometer">aneroid barometer</a> with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>.</p>
<p>There are several types of aviation altitude:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Indicated altitude</b> is the reading on the altimeter when it is set to the <a href="/wiki/QNH" title="QNH">local barometric pressure at mean sea level</a>. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, <i>the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from mean sea level</i>; this is referred to over the radio as <b>altitude</b>.(see <a href="/wiki/QNH" title="QNH">QNH</a>)</li>
<li><b>Absolute altitude</b> is the height of the aircraft above the terrain over which it is flying. It can be measured using a <a href="/wiki/Radar_altimeter" title="Radar altimeter">radar altimeter</a> (or "absolute altimeter"). Also referred to as "radar height" or feet/metres <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Above_Ground_Level" title="Above Ground Level">above ground level</a> (AGL).</li>
<li><b>True altitude</b> is the actual elevation above <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mean_sea_level" title="Mean sea level">mean sea level</a>. It is indicated altitude corrected for non-standard temperature and pressure.</li>
<li><b>Height</b> is the elevation above a ground reference point, commonly the terrain elevation. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, <i>the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from a specified datum</i>; this is referred to over the radio as <b>height</b>, where the specified datum is the airfield elevation (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mean_sea_level_pressure" title="Mean sea level pressure">QFE</a>)</li>
<li><b>Pressure altitude</b> is the elevation above a standard datum air-pressure plane (typically, 1013.25 millibars or 29.92" Hg). Pressure altitude is used to indicate "flight level" which is the standard for altitude reporting in the U.S. in Class A airspace (above roughly 18,000 feet). Pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the altimeter setting is 29.92" Hg or 1013.25 millibars.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Density_altitude" title="Density altitude">Density altitude</a></b> is the altitude corrected for non-ISA <a href="/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere" title="International Standard Atmosphere">International Standard Atmosphere</a> atmospheric conditions. Aircraft performance depends on density altitude, which is affected by barometric pressure, humidity and temperature. On a very hot day, density altitude at an airport (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high as to preclude takeoff, particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Indicated altitude</b> – the altitude shown on the altimeter.</li>
<li><b>Absolute altitude</b> – altitude in terms of the distance above the ground directly below</li>
<li><b>True altitude</b> – altitude in terms of elevation above sea level</li>
<li><b>Height</b> – altitude in terms of the distance above a certain point</li>
<li><b>Pressure altitude</b> – the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pressure" title="Air pressure">air pressure</a> in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere</li>
<li><b>Density altitude</b> – the density of the air in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="High_altitude_and_low_pressure">High altitude and low pressure</span></h3>
<p><span id="High_altitude_and_low_air_pressure"></span> Regions on the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as <b>high altitude</b>. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) above sea level.</p>
<p>At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="High_altitude_and_low_temperature">High altitude and low temperature</span></h3>
<p>The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convection</a>. Sunlight in the <a href="/wiki/Visible_spectrum" title="Visible spectrum">visible spectrum</a> hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a> of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly 333 K (60 °C; 140 °F), and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.</p>
<p>However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convection</a>. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel at air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an <a href="/wiki/Adiabatic_process" title="Adiabatic process">adiabatic process</a>, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Adiabatic lapse rate">adiabatic lapse rate</a>, which is approximately 9.8 °C per kilometer (or 5.4 °F per 1000 feet) of altitude.</p>
<p>Note that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_of_vaporization" title="Heat of vaporization">heat of vaporization</a>. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes <a href="/wiki/Dew_point" title="Dew point">saturated</a> and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">clouds</a>), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dry_adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Dry adiabatic lapse rate">dry adiabatic lapse rate</a> to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moist_adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Moist adiabatic lapse rate">moist adiabatic lapse rate</a> (5.5 °C per kilometer or 3 °F per 1000 feet As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_standard_atmosphere" title="International standard atmosphere">international standard atmosphere</a> (ISA) with a temperature <a href="/wiki/Lapse_rate" title="Lapse rate">lapse rate</a> of 6.49 °C per kilometer (3.56 °F per 1,000 feet). The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.</p>
<p>Finally, note that only the <a href="/wiki/Troposphere" title="Troposphere">troposphere</a> (up to approximately 11 kilometres (36,000 ft) of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes convection: the <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a> does not have convection.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_high_altitude_on_humans" title="Effects of high altitude on humans">Effects of high altitude on humans</a></div>
<p>Medicine recognizes that altitudes above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) start to affect humans, and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above 5,500–6,000 metres (18,000–19,700 ft) for more than two years. As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which affects humans by reducing the <a href="/wiki/Partial_pressure" title="Partial pressure">partial pressure</a> of <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. The lack of oxygen above 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) can cause serious illnesses such as <a href="/wiki/Altitude_sickness" title="Altitude sickness">altitude sickness</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_altitude_pulmonary_edema" title="High altitude pulmonary edema">high altitude pulmonary edema</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_altitude_cerebral_edema" title="High altitude cerebral edema">high altitude cerebral edema</a>. The higher the altitude, the more likely are serious effects. The human body can <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Altitude_acclimatization" title="Altitude acclimatization">adapt to high altitude</a> by breathing faster, having a higher heart rate, and adjusting its blood chemistry. It can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude. However, above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft), (in the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_zone" title="Death zone">death zone</a>"), altitude acclimatization becomes impossible.</p>
<p>There is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes. Additionally, there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States. In addition, the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimer's disease via action of erythropoietin, a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia. However, people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide. The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Athletes">Athletes</span></h4>
<p>For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, <a href="/wiki/Long_jump" title="Long jump">long jump</a>, <a href="/wiki/Triple_jump" title="Triple jump">triple jump</a>) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance. For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) with the letter "A".</p>
<p>Athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. These changes are the basis of <a href="/wiki/Altitude_training" title="Altitude training">altitude training</a> which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field, distance running, triathlon, cycling and swimming.</p>

<p>Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully <a href="/wiki/High-altitude_adaptation" title="High-altitude adaptation">adapted at high altitudes</a>. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phylogeny" title="Phylogeny">phylogeny</a>. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.</p>
<p>There is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower <a href="/wiki/Species_richness" title="Species richness">species richness</a> at high altitudes, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures. These factors may decrease <a href="/wiki/Productivity_(ecology)" title="Productivity (ecology)">productivity</a> in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity.</p>
<p>However, some species, such as birds,thrive at high altitude. Birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight.</p>
