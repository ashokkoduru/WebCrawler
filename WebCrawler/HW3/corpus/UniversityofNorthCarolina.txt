<p>Founded in 1789, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Oldest_public_university_in_the_United_States" title="Oldest public university in the United States">oldest public university in the United States</a>. In 1877, the State of North Carolina began sponsoring additional higher education institutions. Over time the state added a <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_colleges_in_the_United_States" title="Women's colleges in the United States">women's college</a> (now known as the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Greensboro" title="University of North Carolina at Greensboro">University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a>), a <a href="/wiki/Land-grant_university" title="Land-grant university">land-grant university</a> (<a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University" title="North Carolina State University">North Carolina State University</a>), five <a href="/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities" title="Historically black colleges and universities">historically black institutions</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/North_Carolina_A%26T_State_University" title="North Carolina A&amp;T State University">North Carolina A&amp;T State University</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University" title="North Carolina Central University">North Carolina Central University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Winston-Salem_State_University" title="Winston-Salem State University">Winston-Salem State University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fayetteville_State_University" title="Fayetteville State University">Fayetteville State University</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_City_State_University" title="Elizabeth City State University">Elizabeth City State University</a>) and one to educate <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">American Indians</a> (the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Pembroke" title="University of North Carolina at Pembroke">University of North Carolina at Pembroke</a>).

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Depression</a>, the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_General_Assembly" title="North Carolina General Assembly">North Carolina General Assembly</a> searched for cost savings within state government. Towards this effort in 1931, it redefined the University of North Carolina, which at the time referred exclusively to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>; the new <i>Consolidated University of North Carolina</i> was created to include the existing campuses of <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University" title="North Carolina State University">North Carolina State University</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Greensboro" title="University of North Carolina at Greensboro">University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a>. The three campuses came under the leadership of just one board and one president. By 1969, three additional campuses had joined the Consolidated University through legislative action: the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Charlotte" title="University of North Carolina at Charlotte">University of North Carolina at Charlotte</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Asheville" title="University of North Carolina at Asheville">University of North Carolina at Asheville</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Wilmington" title="University of North Carolina at Wilmington">University of North Carolina at Wilmington</a>.</p>
<p>In 1971, North Carolina passed legislation bringing into the University of North Carolina all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor's degrees. This round of consolidation granted each constituent institution a <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_(education)" title="Chancellor (education)">Chancellor</a> and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Board_of_Trustees" title="Board of Trustees">Board of Trustees</a>. In 1985, the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_School_of_Science_and_Mathematics" title="North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics">North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</a>, a residential high school for gifted students, was declared an affiliated school of the university. In 2007, the high school became a full member of the university.</p>
