<p><b>Tidal power</b>, also called <b>tidal energy</b>, is a form of <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a> that converts the energy obtained from <a href="/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">tides</a> into useful forms of power, mainly electricity.</p>
<p>Although not yet widely used, tidal power has potential for future <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>. Tides are more predictable than <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind energy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>. Among sources of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>, tidal power has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. <a href="#Dynamic_tidal_power">dynamic tidal power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tidal_barrage#Tidal_lagoon_power" title="Tidal barrage">tidal lagoons</a>) and turbine technology (e.g. new <a href="/wiki/Tidal_stream_generator#Axial_turbines" title="Tidal stream generator">axial turbines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tidal_stream_generator#Vertical_and_horizontal_axis_crossflow_turbines" title="Tidal stream generator">cross flow turbines</a>), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed, and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels.</p>
<p>Historically, <a href="/wiki/Tide_mill" title="Tide mill">tide mills</a> have been used both in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America. The incoming water was contained in large storage ponds, and as the tide went out, it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain. The earliest occurrences date from the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, or even from <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman times</a>. It was only in the 19th century that the process of using falling water and spinning <a href="/wiki/Turbine" title="Turbine">turbines</a> to create electricity was introduced in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The world's first large-scale tidal power plant is the <a href="/wiki/Rance_Tidal_Power_Station" title="Rance Tidal Power Station">Rance Tidal Power Station</a> in France, which became operational in 1966. It was the largest tidal power station in terms of power output, before <a href="/wiki/Sihwa_Lake_Tidal_Power_Station" title="Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station">Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station</a> surpassed it. Total harvestable energy from tidal areas close to the coast is estimated to be around 1 terawatt worldwide.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">Tide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tidal_acceleration" title="Tidal acceleration">Tidal acceleration</a></div>
<p>Tidal power is taken from the Earth's oceanic <a href="/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">tides</a>. <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" title="Tidal force">Tidal forces</a> are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies. These forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world's oceans. Due to the strong attraction to the oceans, a bulge in the water level is created, causing a temporary increase in sea level. When the sea level is raised, water from the middle of the ocean is forced to move toward the shorelines, creating a tide. This occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner, due to the consistent pattern of the moon’s orbit around the earth. The magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">effects of Earth's rotation</a>, and local <a href="/wiki/Bathymetry" title="Bathymetry">geography of the sea floor and coastlines</a>.</p>
<p>Tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>–<a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> system, and to a lesser extent in the Earth–<a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> system. Other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly with the Sun, including <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">conventional hydroelectric</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wave_power" title="Wave power">wave</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">Nuclear energy</a> makes use of Earth's mineral deposits of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile#Fissile_vs_fissionable" title="Fissile">fissionable</a> elements, while <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a> taps the Earth's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_heat" title="Internal heat">internal heat</a>, which comes from a combination of residual heat from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Planetary_accretion" title="Planetary accretion">planetary accretion</a> (about 20%) and heat produced through <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> (80%).</p>
<p>A tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity. Greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation.</p>
<p>Because the Earth's tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> resource. Movement of tides causes a <a href="/wiki/Tidal_acceleration" title="Tidal acceleration">loss of mechanical energy</a> in the Earth–Moon system: this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscous</a> dissipation at the <a href="/wiki/Seabed" title="Seabed">seabed</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Turbulence" title="Turbulence">turbulence</a>. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5 billion years since its formation. During the last 620 million years the period of rotation of the earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9 hours to 24 hours; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy. While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Generating_methods">Generating methods</span></h2>

<p>Tidal power can be classified into four generating methods:</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_stream_generator">Tidal stream generator</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Tidal_stream_generator" title="Tidal stream generator">Tidal stream generator</a></div>
<p>Tidal stream generators (or TSGs) make use of the <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of moving water to power turbines, in a similar way to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_turbines" title="Wind turbines">wind turbines</a> that use wind to power turbines. Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over impact on the natural landscape. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted and are typically placed near the bottom of the water column where tidal velocities are greatest.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_barrage">Tidal barrage</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Tidal_barrage" title="Tidal barrage">Tidal barrage</a></div>
<p>Tidal barrages make use of the <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy" title="Potential energy">potential energy</a> in the difference in height (or <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_head" title="Hydraulic head">hydraulic head</a>) between high and low tides. When using tidal barrages to generate power, the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams. When the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in, the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam, holding a large amount of potential energy. With the receding tide, this energy is then converted into <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_energy" title="Mechanical energy">mechanical energy</a> as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators. Barrages are essentially <a href="/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">dams</a> across the full width of a tidal estuary.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dynamic_tidal_power">Dynamic tidal power</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_tidal_power" title="Dynamic tidal power">Dynamic tidal power</a></div>

<p>Dynamic tidal power (or DTP) is an untried but promising technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows. It proposes that very long dams (for example: 30–50 km length) be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean, without enclosing an area. Tidal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phase_difference" title="Phase difference">phase differences</a> are introduced across the dam, leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas – featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK, China, and Korea.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_lagoon">Tidal lagoon</span></h3>
<p>A newer tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides. The created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages, except that the location is artificial and does not contain a preexisting ecosystem. The lagoons can also be in double (or triple) format without pumping or with pumping that will flatten out the power output. The pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays. Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time. Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near base load production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage. The proposed <a href="/wiki/Tidal_Lagoon_Swansea_Bay" title="Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay">Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay</a> in Wales, United Kingdom would be the first tidal power station of this type once built.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="US_and_Canadian_studies_in_the_twentieth_century">US and Canadian studies in the twentieth century</span></h2>
<p>The first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the US <a href="/wiki/Federal_Power_Commission" title="Federal Power Commission">Federal Power Commission</a> in 1924 which if built would have been located in the northern border area of the US state of <a href="/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a> and the south eastern border area of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, with various dams, powerhouses, and ship locks enclosing the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Fundy" title="Bay of Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Passamaquoddy_Bay" title="Passamaquoddy Bay">Passamaquoddy Bay</a> (note: see map in reference). Nothing came of the study and it is unknown whether Canada had been approached about the study by the US Federal Power Commission.</p>
<p>In 1956, utility <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia_Light_and_Power" title="Nova Scotia Light and Power">Nova Scotia Light and Power</a> of <a href="/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax</a> commissioned a pair of studies into the feasibility of commercial tidal power development on the <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> side of the Bay of Fundy. The two studies, by <a href="/wiki/Stone_%26_Webster" title="Stone &amp; Webster">Stone &amp; Webster</a> of <a href="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a> and by <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Engineering_Company" title="Montreal Engineering Company">Montreal Engineering Company</a> of <a href="/wiki/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> independently concluded that millions of horsepower could be harnessed from Fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive at that time.</p>
<p>There was also a report on the international commission in April 1961 entitled "Investigation of the International Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project" produced by both the US and Canadian Federal Governments. According to benefit to costs ratios, the project was beneficial to the US but not to Canada. A highway system along the top of the dams was envisioned as well.</p>
<p>A study was commissioned by the Canadian, Nova Scotian and New Brunswick governments (Reassessment of Fundy Tidal Power) to determine the potential for tidal barrages at Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin – at the end of the Fundy Bay estuary. There were three sites determined to be financially feasible: Shepody Bay (1550 MW), Cumberline Basin (1085 MW), and Cobequid Bay (3800 MW). These were never built despite their apparent feasibility in 1977.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_power_development_in_the_UK">Tidal power development in the UK</span></h2>
<p>The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the <a class="external text" href="http://www.emec.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)</a> has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness, off the island of Eday, in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. This area has a very strong tidal current, which can travel up to 4 m/s (8 knots) in spring tides. Tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include: Alstom (formerly Tidal Generation Ltd); ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest; Atlantis Resources Corporation; Nautricity; OpenHydro; Scotrenewables Tidal Power; Voith. The resource could be 4 TJ per year.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_power_issues">Tidal power issues</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_concerns">Environmental concerns</span></h3>
<p>Tidal power can have effects on marine life. The turbines can accidentally kill swimming sea life with the rotating blades, although projects such as the one in Strangford feature a safety mechanism that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach. Some <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> may no longer utilize the area if threatened with a constant rotating or noise-making object. Marine life is a huge factor when placing tidal power <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_generator" title="Energy generator">energy generators</a> in the water and precautions are made to ensure that as many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_animal" title="Marine animal">marine animals</a> as possible will not be affected by it. The <a href="/wiki/Tethys_(database)" title="Tethys (database)">Tethys database</a> provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_turbines">Tidal turbines</span></h4>
<p>The main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_field" title="Electromagnetic field">EMF</a> and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. It should be noted that because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with <a href="/wiki/Offshore_wind_power" title="Offshore wind power">offshore wind energy</a>. Depending on the <a href="/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amplitude" title="Amplitude">amplitude</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sound" title="Sound">sound</a> generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who <a href="/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="Animal echolocation">echolocate</a> to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as <a href="/wiki/Dolphin" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Whale" title="Whale">whales</a>). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">water quality</a> and disrupting <a href="/wiki/Sediment" title="Sediment">sediment</a> processes. Depending on the size of the project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> and processes.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_barrage_2">Tidal barrage</span></h4>
<p>Installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the <a href="/wiki/Bay" title="Bay">bay</a> or <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, affecting a large ecosystem that depends on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tidal_flat" title="Tidal flat">tidal flats</a>. Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional <a href="/wiki/Turbidity" title="Turbidity">turbidity</a> (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary. In August 2004, a <a href="/wiki/Humpback_whale" title="Humpback whale">humpback whale</a> swam through the open <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sluice_gate" title="Sluice gate">sluice gate</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Annapolis_Royal_Generating_Station" title="Annapolis Royal Generating Station">Annapolis Royal Generating Station</a> at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the <a href="/wiki/Annapolis_Basin" title="Annapolis Basin">Annapolis Basin</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tidal_lagoon_2">Tidal lagoon</span></h4>
<p>Environmentally, the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the <a href="/wiki/Lagoon" title="Lagoon">lagoon</a>, acoustic output from turbines, and changes in sedimentation processes. However, all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Corrosion">Corrosion</span></h3>
<p>Salt water causes corrosion in metal parts. It can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate, corrosion damage.</p>
<p>Mechanical fluids, such as lubricants, can leak out, which may be harmful to the marine life nearby. Proper maintenance can minimize the amount of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fouling">Fouling</span></h3>
<p>The biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms. In the <a class="external text" href="http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/tag/tidal-energy/" rel="nofollow">references of the Tidal Current Project</a> at <a class="external text" href="http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/home/" rel="nofollow">Race Rocks</a> in British Columbia this is documented. Also see <a class="external text" href="http://racerocks.ca/energy/tidalremove/tidalremove.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> and Several structural materials and coatings were tested by the <a class="external text" href="http://www.racerocks.com/racerock/energy/tidalenergy/succession/succession.htm" rel="nofollow">Lester Pearson College divers</a> to assist Clean Current in reducing fouling on the turbine and other underwater infrastructure.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structural_Health_Monitoring">Structural Health Monitoring</span></h2>
<p>The high load factors resulting from the fact that water is 800 times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind makes tidal energy particularly attractive for Electric power generation. Condition monitoring is the key for exploiting it cost-efficiently.</p>
