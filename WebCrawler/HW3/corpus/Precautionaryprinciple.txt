<p>The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. The principle implies that there is a <a href="/wiki/Social_responsibility" title="Social responsibility">social responsibility</a> to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins_and_theory">Origins and theory</span></h2>
<p>The concept "precautionary principle" is generally considered to have arisen in English from a translation of the German term <i>Vorsorgeprinzip</i> in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The concepts underpinning the precautionary principle pre-date the term's inception. For example, the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary <a href="/wiki/Aphorism" title="Aphorism">aphorisms</a> such as "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", "better safe than sorry", and "look before you leap". The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the "ancient-medical principle" of "<a href="/wiki/Primum_non_nocere" title="Primum non nocere">first, do no harm</a>" to apply to institutions and institutional decision-making processes rather than individuals.</p>
<p>In economics, the Precautionary Principle has been analysed in terms of "the effect on rational decision-making", of "the interaction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irreversibility" title="Irreversibility">irreversibility</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Uncertainty" title="Uncertainty">uncertainty</a>". Authors such as Epstein (1980) and Arrow and Fischer (1974) show that "irreversibility of possible future consequences" creates a "quasi-<a href="/wiki/Option_(finance)" title="Option (finance)">option</a> effect" which should induce a "<a href="/wiki/Risk" title="Risk">risk</a>-neutral" society to favour current decisions that allow for more flexibility in the future. Gollier et al. (2000) conclude that "more scientific uncertainty as to the distribution of a future risk – that is, a larger variability of beliefs – should induce society to take stronger prevention measures today."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Formulations">Formulations</span></h2>
<p>Many definitions of the precautionary principle exist: Precaution may be defined as "caution in advance," "caution practised in the context of uncertainty," or informed <a href="/wiki/Prudence" title="Prudence">prudence</a>. Two ideas lie at the core of the principle:</p>
<ol>
<li>an expression of a need by decision-makers to anticipate harm before it occurs. Within this element lies an implicit reversal of the onus of proof: under the precautionary principle it is the responsibility of an activity-proponent to establish that the proposed activity will not (or is very unlikely to) result in significant harm.</li>
<li>the concept of proportionality of the risk and the cost and feasibility of a proposed action</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the primary foundations of the precautionary principle, and globally accepted definitions, results from the work of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rio_Conference" title="Rio Conference">Rio Conference</a>, or "<a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a>" in 1992. The principle 15 of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rio_Declaration" title="Rio Declaration">Rio Declaration</a> notes: "In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."</p>
<p>The 1998 <a href="/wiki/Wingspread_Conference_on_the_Precautionary_Principle" title="Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle">Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle</a> summarises the principle this way: "When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically." The Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle was convened by the Science and Environmental Health Network.</p>
<p>The 2 February 2000, Commission of the European Communities, <i>Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle</i>, noted that, "The precautionary principle is not defined in the <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">Treaty</a>, which prescribes it [the Precautionary Principle] only once – to protect the environment. But in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary-objective-scientific-evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or [and] plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection [for what] chosen for the Community."</p>
<p>The 29 January 2000 <a href="/wiki/Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety" title="Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety">Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety</a> says, in regard to controversies over <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GMO" title="GMO">GMO</a>s: "Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information ... shall not prevent the Party of [I]mport, in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects, from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Application">Application</span></h2>
<p>The application of the precautionary principle is hampered by both lack of political will, as well as the wide range of interpretations placed on it. One study identified 14 different formulations of the principle in treaties and nontreaty declarations. R.B. Stewart (2002) reduced the precautionary principle to four basic versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scientific uncertainty should not automatically preclude regulation of activities that pose a potential risk of significant harm (Non-Preclusion PP).</li>
<li>Regulatory controls should incorporate a margin of safety; activities should be limited below the level at which no adverse effect has been observed or predicted (Margin of Safety PP).</li>
<li>Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be subject to best technology available requirements to minimise the risk of harm unless the proponent of the activity shows that they present no appreciable risk of harm (BAT PP).</li>
<li>Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be prohibited unless the proponent of the activity shows that it presents no appreciable risk of harm (Prohibitory PP).</li>
</ol>
<p>In deciding how to apply the principle, analysis may use a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> that factors in both the <a href="/wiki/Opportunity_cost" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a> of not acting, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Option_value" title="Option value">option value</a> of waiting for further information before acting. One of the difficulties of the application of the principle in modern policy-making is that there is often an irreducible conflict between different interests, so that the debate necessarily involves politics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Strong_vs._weak">Strong vs. weak</span></h3>
<p><i>Strong precaution</i> holds that regulation is required whenever there is a possible risk to health, safety, or the environment, even if the supporting evidence is speculative and even if the economic costs of regulation are high. In 1982, the United Nations <a href="/wiki/World_Charter_for_Nature" title="World Charter for Nature">World Charter for Nature</a> gave the first international recognition to the strong version of the principle, suggesting that when "potential adverse effects are not fully understood, the activities should not proceed." The widely publicised <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wingspread_Declaration" title="Wingspread Declaration">Wingspread Declaration</a>, from a meeting of environmentalists in 1998, is another example of the strong version. Strong precaution can also be termed as a "no-regrets" principle, where costs are not considered in preventative action.</p>
<p><i>Weak precaution</i> holds that lack of scientific evidence does not preclude action if damage would otherwise be serious and irreversible. Humans practice weak precaution every day, and often incur costs, to avoid hazards that are far from certain: we do not walk in moderately dangerous areas at night, we exercise, we buy smoke detectors, we buckle our seatbelts.</p>
<p>According to a publication by the New Zealand Treasury Department,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weak version [of the Precautionary Principle] is the least restrictive and allows preventive measures to be taken in the face of uncertainty, but does not require them (eg, Rio Declaration 1992; United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change 1992). To satisfy the threshold of harm, there must be some evidence relating to both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of consequences. Some, but not all, require consideration of the costs of precautionary measures. Weak formulations do not preclude weighing benefits against the costs. Factors other than scientific uncertainty, including economic considerations, may provide legitimate grounds for postponing action. Under weak formulations, the requirement to justify the need for action (the burden of proof) generally falls on those advocating precautionary action. No mention is made of assignment of liability for environmental harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Strong versions justify or require precautionary measures and some also establish liability for environmental harm, which is effectively a strong form of "polluter pays". For example, the <a href="/wiki/Earth_Charter" title="Earth Charter">Earth Charter</a> states: "When knowledge is limited apply a precautionary approach ... Place the burden of proof on those who argue that a proposed activity will not cause significant harm, and make the responsible parties liable for environmental harm." Reversal of proof requires those proposing an activity to prove that the product, process or technology is sufficiently "safe" before approval is granted. Requiring proof of "no environmental harm" before any action proceeds implies the public is not prepared to accept any environmental risk, no matter what economic or social benefits may arise (Peterson, 2006). At the extreme, such a requirement could involve bans and prohibitions on entire classes of potentially threatening activities or substances (Cooney, 2005). Over time, there has been a gradual transformation of the precautionary principle from what appears in the Rio Declaration to a stronger form that arguably [by whom] acts as restraint on development in the absence of firm evidence that it will do no harm.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International_agreements_and_declarations">International agreements and declarations</span></h3>
<p>The World Charter for Nature, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982, was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle. The principle was implemented in an international treaty as early as the 1987 <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Protocol" title="Montreal Protocol">Montreal Protocol</a>, and among other international treaties and declarations is reflected in the 1992 <a href="/wiki/Rio_Declaration_on_Environment_and_Development" title="Rio Declaration on Environment and Development">Rio Declaration on Environment and Development</a> (signed at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Environment_and_Development" title="United Nations Conference on Environment and Development">United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</a>).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Principle.22_vs._.22approach.22">"Principle" vs. "approach"</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>No introduction to the precautionary principle would be complete without brief reference to the difference between the precautionary <b>principle</b> and the precautionary <b>approach</b>. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration 1992 states that: "in order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall be not used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." As Garcia (1995) pointed out, "the wording, largely similar to that of the principle, is subtly different in that: (1) it recognizes that there may be differences in local capabilities to apply the approach, and (2) it calls for cost-effectiveness in applying the approach, e.g., taking economic and social costs into account." The 'approach' is generally considered a softening of the 'principle'.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"As Recuerda has noted, the distinction between the 'precautionary principle' and a 'precautionary approach' is diffuse and, in some contexts, controversial. In the negotiations of international declarations, the United States has opposed the use of the term 'principle' because this term has special connotations in legal language, due to the fact that a 'principle of law` is a source of law. This means that it is compulsory, so a court can quash or confirm a decision through the application of the precautionary principle. In this sense, the precautionary principle is not a simple idea or a desideratum but a source of law. This is the legal status of the precautionary principle in the European Union. On the other hand, an 'approach' usually does not have the same meaning, although in some particular cases an approach could be binding. A precautionary approach is a particular 'lens' used to identify risk that every prudent person possesses (Recuerda, 2008)</p>

<p>On 2 February 2000, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> issued a Communication on the precautionary principle, in which it adopted a procedure for the application of this concept, but without giving a detailed definition of it. Paragraph 2 of article 191 of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the adoption of the European Commission's Communication on the precautionary principle, the principle has come to inform much EU policy, including areas beyond environmental policy. As of 2006 it had been integrated into EU laws "in matters such as general product safety, the use of additives for use in animal nutrition, the incineration of waste, and the regulation of genetically modified organisms." Through its application in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Case_law" title="Case law">case law</a>, it has become a "general principle of EU law."</p>

<p>The most important Australian court case so far, due to its exceptionally detailed consideration of the precautionary principle, is Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council.</p>
<p>The Principle was summarised by reference to the <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales">NSW</a> <i>Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991</i>, which itself provides a good definition of the principle:</p>
<p>"If there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reasoning for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. In the application of the principle… decisions should be guided by: (i) careful evaluation to avoid, wherever practicable, serious or irreversible damage to the environment; and (ii) an assessment of risk-weighted consequence of various options".</p>
<p>The most significant points of Justice Preston's decision are the following findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The principle and accompanying need to take precautionary measures is "triggered" when two prior conditions exist: a threat of serious or irreversible damage, and scientific uncertainty as to the extent of possible damage.</li>
<li>Once both are satisfied, "a proportionate precautionary measure may be taken to avert the anticipated threat of environmental damage, but it should be proportionate."</li>
<li>The threat of serious or irreversible damage should invoke consideration of five factors: the scale of threat (local, regional etc.); the perceived value of the threatened environment; whether the possible impacts are manageable; the level of public concern, and whether there is a rational or scientific basis for the concern.</li>
<li>The consideration of the level of scientific uncertainty should involve factors which may include: what would constitute sufficient evidence; the level and kind of uncertainty; and the potential to reduce uncertainty.</li>
<li>The principle shifts the burden of proof. If the principle applies, the burden shifts: "a decision maker must assume the threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage is… a reality [and] the burden of showing this threat… is negligible reverts to the proponent…"</li>
<li>The precautionary principle invokes preventative action: "the principle permits the taking of preventative measures without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of the threat become fully known".</li>
<li>"The precautionary principle should not be used to try to avoid all risks."</li>
<li>The precautionary measures appropriate will depend on the combined effect of "the degree of seriousness and irreversibility of the threat and the degree of uncertainty… the more significant and uncertain the threat, the greater…the precaution required". "…measures should be adopted… proportionate to the potential threats".</li>

The Court of Appeals granted the petition, citing the precautionary principle stating "when human activities may lead to threats of serious and irreversible damage to the environment that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish the threat." Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration in June 2013 and on 20 September 2013 the Court of Appeals chose to uphold their May decision saying the <i>bt talong</i> field trials violate the people's constitutional right to a "balanced and healthful ecology."

Thus, a species like the <a href="/wiki/Silvery_pigeon" title="Silvery pigeon">silvery pigeon</a> that might exist in considerable numbers and simply be under-recorded or might just as probably be long extinct is not classified as "data deficient" or "extinct" (which both do not require any protective action to be taken), but as "critically endangered" (the conservation status that confers the need for the strongest protection), whereas the increasingly rare, but probably not yet endangered <a href="/wiki/Emerald_starling" title="Emerald starling">emerald starling</a> is classified as "data deficient", because there is urgent need for research to clarify its status rather than for conservation action to save it from extinction.</p>
<p>If, for example, a large ground-water body that many people use for drinking water is contaminated by bacteria (e-coli 0157 H7, campylobacter or leptospirosis) and the source of contamination is strongly suspected to be dairy cows but the exact science is not yet able to provide absolute proof, the cows should be removed from the environment until they are proved, by the dairy industry, not to be the source or until that industry ensures that such contamination will not recur.</p>

<p>Strong formulations of the precautionary principle, without regard to its most basic provisions that it is to be applied only where risks are potentially high AND not easily calculable, applied to the principle itself as a policy decision, may rule out its own use. The reason suggested is that preventing innovation from coming to market means that only current technology may be used, and current technology itself may cause harm or leave needs unmet; there is a risk of causing harm by blocking innovation. As <a href="/wiki/Michael_Crichton" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> wrote in his novel <i><a href="/wiki/State_of_Fear" title="State of Fear">State of Fear</a></i>: "The 'precautionary principle', properly applied, forbids the precautionary principle." For example, forbidding nuclear power plants based on concerns about risk means continuing to rely on power plants that burn fossil fuels, which continue to release <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a>. In another example, the Hazardous Air Pollutant provisions in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(1990)" title="Clean Air Act (1990)">1990 amendments to the US Clean Air Act</a> are an example of the Precautionary Principle where the onus is now on showing a listed compound is harmless.
