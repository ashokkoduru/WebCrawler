<p>A <b>breeder reactor</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a> that generates more <a href="/wiki/Fissile_material" title="Fissile material">fissile material</a> than it <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile#Fissile_vs_fissionable" title="Fissile">consumes</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fuel_efficiency_and_types_of_nuclear_waste">Fuel efficiency and types of nuclear waste</span></h2>

<p>Breeder reactors could, in principle, extract almost all of the energy contained in <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely used once-through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactors" title="Light water reactors">light water reactors</a>, which extract less than 1% of the energy in the uranium mined from the earth. The high fuel efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply or energy used in mining. Adherents claim that with <a href="/wiki/Peak_uranium#Seawater" title="Peak uranium">seawater uranium extraction</a>, there would be enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy our energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983's total energy consumption rate, thus making nuclear energy effectively a <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>.</p>
<p>Nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s. In broad terms, spent nuclear fuel has two main components. The first consists of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission_product" title="Nuclear fission product">fission products</a>, the leftover fragments of fuel atoms after they have been split to release energy. Fission products come in dozens of elements and hundreds of isotopes, all of them lighter than uranium. The second main component of spent fuel is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic" title="Transuranic">transuranics</a> (atoms heavier than uranium), which are generated from uranium or heavier atoms in the fuel when they absorb neutrons but do not undergo fission. All transuranic isotopes fall within the <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinide</a> series on the <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a>, and so they are frequently referred to as the actinides.</p>
<p>The physical behavior of the fission products is markedly different from that of the transuranics. In particular, fission products do not themselves undergo fission, and therefore cannot be used for nuclear weapons. Furthermore, only seven <a href="/wiki/Long-lived_fission_product" title="Long-lived fission product">long-lived fission product</a> isotopes have half-lives longer than a hundred years, which makes their geological storage or disposal less problematic than for transuranic materials.</p>
<p>With increased concerns about nuclear waste, breeding fuel cycles became interesting again because they can reduce actinide wastes, particularly <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minor_actinides" title="Minor actinides">minor actinides</a>. Breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel, and thus convert them to more fission products.</p>
<p>After "<a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>" is removed from a light water reactor, it undergoes a complex decay profile as each nuclide decays at a different rate. Due to a physical oddity referenced below, there is a large gap in the decay half-lives of fission products compared to transuranic isotopes. If the transuranics are left in the spent fuel, after 1,000 to 100,000 years, the slow decay of these transuranics would generate most of the radioactivity in that spent fuel. Thus, removing the transuranics from the waste eliminates much of the long-term radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>Today's commercial light water reactors do breed some new fissile material, mostly in the form of plutonium. Because commercial reactors were never designed as breeders, they do not convert enough uranium-238 into plutonium to replace the <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">uranium-235</a> consumed. Nonetheless, at least one-third of the power produced by commercial nuclear reactors comes from fission of plutonium generated within the fuel. Even with this level of plutonium consumption, light water reactors consume only part of the plutonium and minor actinides they produce, and nonfissile <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_plutonium" title="Isotopes of plutonium">isotopes of plutonium</a> build up, along with significant quantities of other minor actinides.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conversion_ratio.2C_breakeven.2C_breeding_ratio.2C_doubling_time.2C_and_burnup">Conversion ratio, breakeven, breeding ratio, doubling time, and burnup</span></h2>
<p>One measure of a reactor's performance is the "conversion ratio" (the average number of new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile" title="Fissile">fissile</a> atoms created per <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">fission event</a>). All proposed nuclear reactors except specially designed and operated actinide burners experience some degree of conversion. As long as there is any amount of a fertile material within the <a href="/wiki/Neutron_flux" title="Neutron flux">neutron flux</a> of the reactor, some new fissile material is always created.</p>
<p>The ratio of new fissile material in spent fuel to fissile material consumed from the fresh fuel is known as the "conversion ratio" or "breeding ratio" of a reactor.</p>
<p>For example, commonly used light water reactors have a conversion ratio of approximately 0.6. Pressurized heavy water reactors (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PHWR" title="PHWR">PHWR</a>) running on natural uranium have a conversion ratio of 0.8. In a breeder reactor, the conversion ratio is higher than 1. "Breakeven" is achieved when the conversion ratio becomes 1: the reactor produces as much fissile material as it uses.</p>
<p>"Doubling time" is the amount of time it would take for a breeder reactor to produce enough new fissile material to create a starting fuel load for another nuclear reactor. This was considered an important measure of breeder performance in early years, when uranium was thought to be scarce. However, since uranium is more abundant than thought, and given the amount of plutonium available in spent reactor fuel, doubling time has become a less important metric in modern breeder reactor design.</p>
<p>"<a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">Burnup</a>" is a measure of how much energy has been extracted from a given mass of heavy metal in fuel, often expressed (for power reactors) in terms of gigawatt-days per ton of heavy metal. Burnup is an important factor in determining the types and abundances of isotopes produced by a fission reactor. Breeder reactors, by design, have extremely high burnup compared to a conventional reactor, as breeder reactors produce much more of their waste in the form of fission products, while most or all of the actinides are meant to be fissioned and destroyed.</p>
<p>In the past breeder reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding ratios, from 1.01 for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shippingport_Reactor" title="Shippingport Reactor">Shippingport Reactor</a> running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 1.2 for the Soviet <a href="/wiki/BN-350_reactor" title="BN-350 reactor">BN-350</a> liquid-metal-cooled reactor. Theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements ("tube-in-shell" construction) suggest breeding ratios of at least 1.8 are possible on an industrial scale. The Soviet BR-1 test reactor achieved a breeding ratio of 2.5 under non-commercial conditions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_breeder_reactor">Types of breeder reactor</span></h2>

<p>Many types of breeder reactor are possible:</p>
<p>A 'breeder' is simply a reactor designed for very high neutron economy with an associated conversion rate higher than 1.0. In principle, almost any reactor design could possibly be tweaked to become a breeder. An example of this process is the evolution of the Light Water Reactor, a very heavily moderated thermal design, into the Super Fast Reactor  concept, using light water in an extremely low-density <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_fluid" title="Supercritical fluid">supercritical</a> form to increase the neutron economy high enough to allow breeding.</p>
<p>Aside from water cooled, there are many other types of breeder reactor currently envisioned as possible. These include <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">molten-salt cooled</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gas-cooled_fast_reactor" title="Gas-cooled fast reactor">gas cooled</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor" title="Liquid metal cooled reactor">liquid metal cooled</a> designs in many variations. Almost any of these basic design types may be fueled by uranium, plutonium, many minor actinides, or thorium, and they may be designed for many different goals, such as creating more fissile fuel, long-term steady-state operation, or active burning of nuclear wastes.</p>
<p>For convenience, it is perhaps simplest to divide the extant reactor designs into two broad categories based upon their neutron spectrum, which has the natural effect of dividing the reactor designs into those designed to use primarily uranium and transuranics, and those designed to use thorium and avoid transuranics.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="#Fast_breeder_reactor">Fast breeder reactor</a></b> or FBR uses fast (unmoderated) neutrons to breed fissile plutonium and possibly higher transuranics from fertile uranium-238. The fast spectrum is flexible enough that it can also breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, if desired.</li>
<li><b><a href="#Thermal_breeder_reactor">Thermal breeder reactor</a></b> use thermal spectrum (moderated) neutrons to breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium (<a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle" title="Thorium fuel cycle">thorium fuel cycle</a>). Due to the behavior of the various nuclear fuels, a thermal breeder is thought commercially feasible only with thorium fuel, which avoids the buildup of the heavier transuranics.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reprocessing">Reprocessing</span></h2>
<p>Fission of the nuclear fuel in any reactor produces neutron-absorbing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a>. Because of this unavoidable physical process, it is necessary to <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">reprocess</a> the fertile material from a breeder reactor to remove those <a href="/wiki/Neutron_poison" title="Neutron poison">neutron poisons</a>. This step is required if one is to fully utilize the ability to breed as much or more fuel than is consumed. All reprocessing can present a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">proliferation</a> concern, since it extracts weapons usable material from spent fuel. The most common reprocessing technique, <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a>, presents a particular concern, since it was expressly designed to separate pure plutonium. Early proposals for the breeder reactor fuel cycle posed an even greater proliferation concern because they would use PUREX to separate plutonium in a highly attractive isotopic form for use in nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Several countries are developing reprocessing methods that do not separate the plutonium from the other actinides. For instance, the non-water based <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pyrometallurgical" title="Pyrometallurgical">pyrometallurgical</a> <a href="/wiki/Electrowinning" title="Electrowinning">electrowinning</a> process, when used to reprocess fuel from an <a href="/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor" title="Integral fast reactor">integral fast reactor</a>, leaves large amounts of radioactive actinides in the reactor fuel. More conventional advanced, water-based reprocessing systems like PUREX, include SANEX, UNEX, DIAMEX, COEX, and TRUEX—as well as proposals to combine PUREX with co-processes.</p>
<p>All these systems have better proliferation resistance than PUREX, though their adoption rate is low.</p>
<p>In the thorium cycle, thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of U-232 are also produced, which has the strong gamma emitter <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_thallium" title="Isotopes of thallium">Tl-208</a> in its decay chain. Similar to uranium-fueled designs, the longer the fuel and fertile material remain in the reactor, the more of these undesirable elements build up. Inside the envisioned commercial thorium reactors high levels of U232 would be allowed to accumulate, leading to extremely high gamma radiation doses from any uranium derived from thorium. These gamma rays complicate the safe handling of a weapon and the design of its electronics; this explains why U-233 has never been pursued for weapons beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Waste_reduction">Waste reduction</span></h2>

<p>Nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s. Breeding fuel cycles attracted renewed interest because of their potential to reduce actinide wastes, particularly plutonium and minor actinides. Since breeder reactors on a closed fuel cycle would use nearly all of the actinides fed into them as fuel, their fuel requirements would be reduced by a factor of about 100. The volume of waste they generate would be reduced by a factor of about 100 as well. While there is a huge reduction in the <i>volume</i> of waste from a breeder reactor, the <a href="/wiki/Specific_activity" title="Specific activity"><i>activity</i></a> of the waste is about the same as that produced by a light water reactor.</p>
<p>In addition, the waste from a breeder reactor has a different decay behavior, because it is made up of different materials. Breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products, while light water reactor waste has a large quantity of transuranics. After <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> has been removed from a light water reactor for longer than 100,000 years, these transuranics would be the main source of radioactivity. Eliminating them would eliminate much of the long-term radioactivity from the spent fuel.</p>
<p>In principle, breeder fuel cycles can recycle and consume all actinides, leaving only <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a>. As the graphic in this section indicates, fission products have a peculiar 'gap' in their aggregate half-lives, such that no fission products have a half-life longer than 91 years and shorter than two hundred thousand years. As a result of this physical oddity, after several hundred years in storage, the activity of the radioactive waste from a Fast Breeder Reactor would quickly drop to the low level of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Long-lived_fission_products" title="Long-lived fission products">long-lived fission products</a>. However, to obtain this benefit requires the highly efficient separation of transuranics from spent fuel. If the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">fuel reprocessing</a> methods used leave a large fraction of the transuranics in the final waste stream, this advantage would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Both types of breeding cycles can reduce actinide wastes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_breeder_reactor" title="Fast breeder reactor">fast breeder reactor</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_neutron" title="Fast neutron">fast neutrons</a> can fission actinide nuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons. Such nuclei usually lack the <a href="/wiki/Neutron_cross_section" title="Neutron cross section">low-speed</a> "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_neutron" title="Thermal neutron">thermal neutron</a>" <a href="/wiki/Doppler_broadening" title="Doppler broadening">resonances</a> of fissile fuels used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LWR" title="LWR">LWRs</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle" title="Thorium fuel cycle">thorium fuel cycle</a> inherently produces lower levels of heavy actinides. The fertile material in the thorium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 232, while the fertile material in the uranium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 238. That mass difference means that thorium-232 requires six more neutron capture events per nucleus before the transuranic elements can be produced. In addition to this simple mass difference, the reactor gets two chances to fission the nuclei as the mass increases: First as the effective fuel nuclei U233, and as it absorbs two more neutrons, again as the fuel nuclei U235.</li>
</ul>
<p>A reactor whose main purpose is to destroy actinides, rather than increasing fissile fuel stocks, is sometimes known as a <b>burner reactor</b>. Both breeding and burning depend on good neutron economy, and many designs can do either. Breeding designs surround the core by a <b>breeding blanket</b> of fertile material. Waste burners surround the core with non-fertile wastes to be destroyed. Some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeder_reactor_concepts">Breeder reactor concepts</span></h2>
<p>There are several concepts for breeder reactors; the two main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactors with a <a href="/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor" title="Fast-neutron reactor">fast neutron spectrum</a> are called fast breeder reactors (FBR) – these typically utilize uranium-238 as fuel.</li>
<li>Reactors with a <a href="/wiki/Thermal-neutron_reactor" title="Thermal-neutron reactor">thermal neutron spectrum</a> are called thermal breeder reactors – these typically utilize thorium-232 as fuel.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fast_breeder_reactor">Fast breeder reactor</span></h3>

<p>In 2006 all large-scale fast breeder reactor (FBR) power stations were <b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liquid_metal_fast_reactor" title="Liquid metal fast reactor">liquid metal fast breeder reactors</a></b> (<b>LMFBR</b>) cooled by liquid <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a>. These have been of one of two designs:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Loop</i> type, in which the primary coolant is circulated through primary heat exchangers outside the reactor tank (but inside the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_shield" title="Biological shield">biological shield</a> due to radioactive sodium-24 in the primary coolant)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><i>Pool</i> type, in which the primary heat exchangers and pumps are immersed in the reactor tank</li>
</ul>
<p>All current <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_neutron_reactor" title="Fast neutron reactor">fast neutron reactor</a> designs use liquid metal as the primary coolant, to transfer heat from the core to steam used to power the electricity generating turbines. FBRs have been built cooled by liquid metals other than sodium—some early FBRs used <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, other experimental reactors have used a <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a>-<a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a> <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloy</a> called <a href="/wiki/NaK" title="NaK">NaK</a>. Both have the advantage that they are liquids at room temperature, which is convenient for experimental rigs but less important for pilot or full scale power stations. <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">Lead</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lead-bismuth_eutectic" title="Lead-bismuth eutectic">lead-bismuth alloy</a> have also been <a href="/wiki/Lead-cooled_fast_reactor" title="Lead-cooled fast reactor">used</a>. The relative merits of lead vs sodium are discussed <a class="external text" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V4D-4K2T5D7-5&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=df85272db6aac0f870d0004ed28d513e" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Looking further ahead, four of the proposed <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">generation IV reactor</a> types are FBRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gas-Cooled_Fast_Reactor" title="Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor">Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor</a></b> (GFR) cooled by <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>.</li>
<li><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sodium-Cooled_Fast_Reactor" title="Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor">Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor</a></b> (SFR) based on the existing Liquid Metal FBR (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LMFBR" title="LMFBR">LMFBR</a>) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">Integral Fast Reactor</a> designs.</li>
<li><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lead-Cooled_Fast_Reactor" title="Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor">Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor</a></b> (LFR) based on Soviet naval propulsion units.</li>

</ul>
<p>FBRs usually use a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mixed_oxide_fuel" title="Mixed oxide fuel">mixed oxide fuel</a> core of up to 20% <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plutonium_dioxide" title="Plutonium dioxide">plutonium dioxide</a> (PuO<sub>2</sub>) and at least 80% <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> (UO<sub>2</sub>). Another fuel option is <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel#Metal_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">metal alloys</a>, typically a blend of uranium, plutonium, and <a href="/wiki/Zirconium" title="Zirconium">zirconium</a> (used because it is "transparent" to neutrons). <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">Enriched uranium</a> can also be used on its own.</p>
<p>Many designs surround the core in a blanket of tubes that contain non-fissile uranium-238, which, by capturing fast neutrons from the reaction in the core, converts to fissile <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> (as is some of the uranium in the core), which is then reprocessed and used as nuclear fuel. Other FBR designs rely on the geometry of the fuel itself (which also contains uranium-238), arranged to attain sufficient fast neutron capture. The plutonium-239 (or the fissile uranium-235) fission cross-section is much smaller in a fast spectrum than in a thermal spectrum, as is the ratio between the Pu/U fission cross-section and the U absorption cross-section. This increases the concentration of Pu/U needed to sustain a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction" title="Nuclear chain reaction">chain reaction</a>, as well as the ratio of breeding to fission.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a fast reactor needs no <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">moderator</a> to <a href="/wiki/Thermalisation" title="Thermalisation">slow down the neutrons</a> at all, taking advantage of the <a href="/wiki/Neutron_temperature#Fast_neutrons" title="Neutron temperature">fast neutrons</a> producing a greater number of neutrons per fission than <a href="/wiki/Neutron_temperature#slow_neutrons" title="Neutron temperature">slow neutrons</a>. For this reason ordinary liquid <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, being a moderator as well as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neutron_absorber" title="Neutron absorber">neutron absorber</a>, is an undesirable primary coolant for fast reactors. Because large amounts of water in the core are required to cool the reactor, the yield of neutrons and therefore breeding of <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">Pu</a> are strongly affected. Theoretical work has been done on <a href="/wiki/Reduced_moderation_water_reactor" title="Reduced moderation water reactor">reduced moderation water reactors</a>, which may have a sufficiently fast spectrum to provide a breeding ratio slightly over 1. This would likely result in an unacceptable power derating and high costs in an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LWR" title="LWR">liquid-water-cooled</a> reactor, but the supercritical water coolant of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SCWR" title="SCWR">SCWR</a> has sufficient heat capacity to allow adequate cooling with less water, making a fast-spectrum water-cooled reactor a practical possibility.</p>
<p>The only commercially operating reactor as of 2015 is the <a href="/wiki/BN-600_reactor" title="BN-600 reactor">BN-600 reactor</a> in Russia, a 560MW sodium cooled reactor.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Integral_fast_reactor">Integral fast reactor</span></h4>
<p>One design of fast neutron reactor, specifically designed to address the waste disposal and plutonium issues, was the <i><a href="/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor" title="Integral fast reactor">integral fast reactor</a></i> (also known as an <i>integral fast breeder reactor</i>, although the original reactor was designed to not breed a net surplus of fissile material).</p>
<p>To solve the waste disposal problem, the IFR had an on-site <a href="/wiki/Electrowinning" title="Electrowinning">electrowinning</a> fuel reprocessing unit that recycled the uranium and all the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic" title="Transuranic">transuranics</a> (not just plutonium) via <a href="/wiki/Electroplating" title="Electroplating">electroplating</a>, leaving just short <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a> in the waste. Some of these fission products could later be separated for industrial or medical uses and the rest sent to a waste repository (where they would not have to be stored for anywhere near as long as wastes containing long half-life transuranics). The IFR pyroprocessing system uses molten <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> cathodes and electrorefiners to reprocess metallic fuel directly on-site at the reactor. Such systems not only commingle all the minor actinides with both uranium and plutonium, they are compact and self-contained, so that no plutonium-containing material ever needs to be transported away from the site of the breeder reactor. Breeder reactors incorporating such technology would most likely be designed with breeding ratios very close to 1.00, so that after an initial loading of enriched uranium and/or plutonium fuel, the reactor would then be refueled only with small deliveries of natural uranium metal. A quantity of natural uranium metal equivalent to a block about the size of a milk crate delivered once per month would be all the fuel such a 1 gigawatt reactor would need. Such self-contained breeders are currently envisioned as the final self-contained and self-supporting ultimate goal of nuclear reactor designers. The project was canceled in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Energy" title="United States Secretary of Energy">United States Secretary of Energy</a> <a href="/wiki/Hazel_R._O%27Leary" title="Hazel R. O'Leary">Hazel O'Leary</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_fast_reactors">Other fast reactors</span></h4>

<p>Another proposed fast reactor is a fast <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">molten salt reactor</a>, in which the molten salt's moderating properties are insignificant. This is typically achieved by replacing the light metal fluorides (e.g. LiF, BeF<sub>2</sub>) in the salt carrier with heavier metal chlorides (e.g., KCl, RbCl, ZrCl<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p>Several prototype FBRs have been built, ranging in electrical output from a few light bulbs' equivalent (<a href="/wiki/Experimental_Breeder_Reactor_I" title="Experimental Breeder Reactor I">EBR-I</a>, 1951) to over 1,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MWe" title="MWe">MWe</a>. As of 2006, the technology is not economically competitive to thermal reactor technology—but India, Japan, China, <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> and Russia are all committing substantial research funds to further development of Fast Breeder reactors, anticipating that rising uranium prices will change this in the long term. Germany, in contrast, abandoned the technology due to safety concerns. The <a href="/wiki/SNR-300" title="SNR-300">SNR-300</a> fast breeder reactor was finished after 19 years despite cost overruns summing up to a total of 3.6 billion Euros, only to then be abandoned.</p>
<p>As well as their thermal breeder program, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_India" title="Nuclear power in India">India</a> is also developing FBR technology, using both uranium and thorium feedstocks.</p>

<p>The third and final core of the <a href="/wiki/Shippingport_Atomic_Power_Station" title="Shippingport Atomic Power Station">Shippingport Atomic Power Station</a> 60 MWe reactor was a light water thorium breeder, which began operating in 1977. It used pellets made of <a href="/wiki/Thorium_dioxide" title="Thorium dioxide">thorium dioxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uranium-233" title="Uranium-233">uranium-233</a> oxide; initially, the U-233 content of the pellets was 5–6% in the seed region, 1.5–3% in the blanket region and none in the reflector region. It operated at 236 MWt, generating 60 MWe and ultimately produced over 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity. After five years, the core was removed and found to contain nearly 1.4% more fissile material than when it was installed, demonstrating that breeding from thorium had occurred.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor" title="Liquid fluoride thorium reactor">liquid fluoride thorium reactor</a> (LFTR) is also planned as a thorium thermal breeder. Liquid-fluoride reactors may have attractive features, such as inherent safety, no need to manufacture fuel rods and possibly simpler reprocessing of the liquid fuel. This concept was first investigated at the <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> <a href="/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment" title="Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment">Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment</a> in the 1960s. From 2012 it became the subject of renewed interest worldwide. Japan, China, the UK, as well as private US, Czech and Australian companies have expressed intent to develop and commercialize the technology.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeder_reactor_controversy">Breeder reactor controversy</span></h2>
<p>Like many aspects of nuclear power, fast breeder reactors have been subject to much controversy over the years. In 2010 the <a href="/wiki/International_Panel_on_Fissile_Materials" title="International Panel on Fissile Materials">International Panel on Fissile Materials</a> said "After six decades and the expenditure of the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, the promise of breeder reactors remains largely unfulfilled and efforts to commercialize them have been steadily cut back in most countries". In Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, breeder reactor development programs have been abandoned. The rationale for pursuing breeder reactors—sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit—was based on the following key assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was expected that uranium would be scarce and high-grade deposits would quickly become depleted if fission power were deployed on a large scale; the reality, however, is that since the end of the cold war, uranium has been much cheaper and more abundant than early designers expected.</li>
<li>It was expected that breeder reactors would quickly become economically competitive with the light-water reactors that dominate nuclear power today, but the reality is that capital costs are at least 25% more than water cooled reactors.</li>
<li>It was thought that breeder reactors could be as safe and reliable as light-water reactors, but safety issues are cited as a concern with fast reactors that use a sodium coolant, where a leak could lead to a sodium fire.</li>
<li>It was expected that the proliferation risks posed by breeders and their “closed” fuel cycle, in which plutonium would be recycled, could be managed. But since plutonium breeding reactors produce plutonium from U238, and thorium reactors produce fissile U233 from thorium, all breeding cycles could theoretically pose proliferation risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some past anti-nuclear advocates that have become pro-nuclear power as a clean source of electricity since breeder reactors effectively recycle most of their waste. This solves one of the most important negative issues of nuclear power. In the documentary <i><a href="/wiki/Pandora%27s_Promise" title="Pandora's Promise">Pandora's Promise</a></i>, a case is made for breeder reactors because they provide a real, high kW alternative to fossil fuel energy. According to the movie, one pound of uranium provides as much energy as 5000 barrels of oil.</p>
<p>FBRs have been built and operated in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the former <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>, India and Japan. The experimental FBR <a href="/wiki/SNR-300" title="SNR-300">SNR-300</a> was built in Germany but never operated and eventually shut down amid political controversy following the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>. As of 2014 one such reactor was being used for power generation, with another scheduled for early 2015. Several reactors are planned, many for research related to the <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">Generation IV reactor</a> initiative.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> (comprising Russia and other countries, dissolved in 1991) constructed a series of fast reactors, the first being mercury-cooled and fueled with plutonium metal, and the later plants sodium-cooled and fueled with plutonium oxide.</p>

<p>In 2012 an FBR called the <a href="/wiki/Prototype_Fast_Breeder_Reactor" title="Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor">Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor</a> was under construction in India, due to be completed that year, with commissioning date known by mid-year. The FBR program of India includes the concept of using fertile thorium-232 to breed fissile uranium-233. India is also pursuing the thorium thermal breeder reactor. A thermal breeder is not possible with purely uranium/plutonium based technology. Thorium fuel is the strategic direction of the power program of India, owing to the nation's large reserves of thorium, but worldwide known reserves of thorium are also some four times those of uranium. India's Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) said in 2007 that it would simultaneously construct four more breeder reactors of 500 MWe each including two at Kalpakkam.</p>
<p>The new Indian <a href="/wiki/FBR-600" title="FBR-600">FBR-600</a> is being used to advance these plans. The FBR-600 is a pool-type sodium cooled reactor with a rating of 600MWe and advanced active and passive safety features.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/China_Experimental_Fast_Reactor" title="China Experimental Fast Reactor">China Experimental Fast Reactor</a> (CEFR) is a 25 MW(e) prototype for the planned China Prototype Fast Reactor (CFRP). It started generating power on 21 July 2011.</p>
<p>China also initiated a research and development project in thorium molten-salt thermal breeder reactor technology (Liquid fluoride thorium reactor), formally announced at the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (CAS) annual conference in January 2011. Its ultimate target is to investigate and develop a thorium-based molten salt nuclear system over about 20 years.</p>
<p>Kirk Sorensen, former NASA scientist and Chief Nuclear Technologist at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Teledyne_Brown_Engineering" title="Teledyne Brown Engineering">Teledyne Brown Engineering</a>, has long been a promoter of <a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle" title="Thorium fuel cycle">thorium fuel cycle</a> and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors. In 2011, Sorensen founded <a href="/wiki/Flibe_Energy" title="Flibe Energy">Flibe Energy</a>, a company aimed to develop 20-50 MW LFTR reactor designs to power military bases.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> is developing a design for a standardized modular FBR for export, to complement the standardized <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pressurized_Water_Reactor" title="Pressurized Water Reactor">PWR</a> (Pressurized Water Reactor) and <a href="/wiki/CANDU_reactor" title="CANDU reactor">CANDU</a> designs they have already developed and built, but has not yet committed to building a prototype.</p>

<p>Russia has a plan for increasing its fleet of fast breeder reactors significantly. A <a href="/wiki/BN-800_reactor" title="BN-800 reactor">BN-800 reactor</a> (800 MWe) at <a href="/wiki/Beloyarsk_Nuclear_Power_Station" title="Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station">Beloyarsk</a> was completed in 2012, succeeding a smaller <a href="/wiki/BN-600_reactor" title="BN-600 reactor">BN-600</a>. In June 2014 the <a href="/wiki/BN-800_reactor" title="BN-800 reactor">BN-800</a> was started in the minimum power mode. The reactor working at 35% of the nominal efficiency, was plugged-in the energy network on 10 December 2015.</p>
<p>Plans for the construction of an even larger <a href="/wiki/BN-1200_reactor" title="BN-1200 reactor">BN-1200 reactor</a> (1,200 MWe) initially anticipated completion in 2018, with two additional BN-1200 reactors built by the end of 2030. However, in 2015 <a href="/wiki/Rosenergoatom" title="Rosenergoatom">Rosenergoatom</a> postponed construction indefinitely to allow fuel design to be improved after more experience of operating the <a href="/wiki/BN-800_reactor" title="BN-800 reactor">BN-800 reactor</a>, and amongst cost concerns.</p>
<p>An experimental lead-cooled fast reactor, <a href="/wiki/BREST_(Reactor)" title="BREST (Reactor)">BREST-300</a> will be built at the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Siberian_Chemical_Combine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Siberian Chemical Combine (page does not exist)">Siberian Chemical Combine</a> (SCC) in <a href="/wiki/Seversk" title="Seversk">Seversk</a>. The BREST design is seen as a successor to the BN series and the 300 MWe unit at the SCC could be the forerunner to a 1,200 MWe version for wide deployment as a commercial power generation unit. The development program is as part of an Advanced Nuclear Technologies Federal Program 2010-2020 that seeks to exploit fast reactors as a way to be vastly more efficient in the use of uranium while 'burning' radioactive substances that otherwise would have to be disposed of as waste. BREST refers to <i>bystry reaktor so svintsovym teplonositelem</i>, Russian for 'fast reactor with lead coolant'. Its core would measure about 2.3 metres in diameter by 1.1 metres in height and contain 16 tonnes of fuel. The unit would be refuelled every year, with each fuel element spending five years in total within the core. Lead coolant temperature would be around 540 °C, giving a high efficiency of 43%, primary heat production of 700 MWt yielding electrical power of 300 MWe. The operational lifespan of the unit could be 60 years. The design is expected to be completed by NIKIET in 2014 for construction between 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>On February 16, 2006, the U.S., France and Japan signed an "arrangement" to research and develop sodium-cooled fast reactors in support of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_Nuclear_Energy_Partnership" title="Global Nuclear Energy Partnership">Global Nuclear Energy Partnership</a>. In April 2007 the Japanese government selected <a href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_Heavy_Industries" title="Mitsubishi Heavy Industries">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a> as the "core company in FBR development in Japan". Shortly thereafter, MHI started a new company, <a href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_FBR_Systems" title="Mitsubishi FBR Systems">Mitsubishi FBR Systems</a> (MFBR) to develop and eventually sell FBR technology.</p>

<p>In September 2010 the French government allocated 651.6 million euros to the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commissariat_%C3%A0_l%27%C3%A9nergie_atomique" title="Commissariat à l'énergie atomique">Commissariat à l'énergie atomique</a></i> to finalize the design of "Astrid" (Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration), a 600 MW reactor design of the 4th generation to be operational in 2020. As of 2013 the UK had shown interest in the <a href="/wiki/PRISM_(reactor)" title="PRISM (reactor)">PRISM</a> reactor and was working in concert with France to develop <a href="/wiki/ASTRID_(reactor)" title="ASTRID (reactor)">ASTRID</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2010 <a href="/wiki/GE_Hitachi_Nuclear_Energy" title="GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy">GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy</a> signed a <a href="/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding" title="Memorandum of understanding">memorandum of understanding</a> with the operators of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">US Department of Energy's</a> <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Savannah_River_site&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Savannah River site (page does not exist)">Savannah River site</a>, which should allow the construction of a demonstration plant based on the company's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/S-PRISM" title="S-PRISM">S-PRISM</a> fast breeder reactor prior to the design receiving full <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission" title="Nuclear Regulatory Commission">NRC</a> licensing approval. In October 2011 <a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> reported that the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and senior advisers within the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) had asked for technical and financial details of the PRISM, partly as a means of reducing the country's plutonium stockpile.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Traveling_wave_reactor" title="Traveling wave reactor">traveling wave reactor</a> proposed in a patent by <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_Ventures" title="Intellectual Ventures">Intellectual Ventures</a> is a fast breeder reactor designed to not need fuel reprocessing during the decades-long lifetime of the reactor. The breed-burn wave in the TWR design does not move from one end of the reactor to the other but gradually from the inside out. Moreover, as the fuel's composition changes through nuclear transmutation, fuel rods are continually reshuffled within the core to optimize the neutron flux and fuel usage at any given point in time. Thus, instead of letting the wave propagate through the fuel, the fuel itself is moved through a largely stationary burn wave. This is contrary to many media reports, which have popularized the concept as a candle-like reactor with a burn region that moves down a stick of fuel. By replacing a static core configuration with an actively managed "standing wave" or "soliton" core, <a href="/wiki/TerraPower" title="TerraPower">TerraPower</a>'s design avoids the problem of cooling a highly variable burn region. Under this scenario, the reconfiguration of fuel rods is accomplished remotely by robotic devices; the containment vessel remains closed during the procedure, and there is no associated downtime.</p>
