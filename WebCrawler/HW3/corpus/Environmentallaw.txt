<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulatory_subjects">Regulatory subjects</span></h2>
<p>The broad category of "environmental law" may be broken down into a number of more specific regulatory subjects. While there is no single agreed-upon taxonomy, the core environmental law regimes address environmental <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>. A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes, now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles, focus on the management of specific <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_resources" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a>, such as forests, minerals, or fisheries. Other areas, such as environmental impact assessment, may not fit neatly into either category, but are nonetheless important components of environmental law.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Impact_assessment">Impact assessment</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment" title="Environmental impact assessment">Environmental impact assessment</a></div>
<p>Environmental impact assessment (EA) is the term used for the assessment of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_impact" title="Environmental impact">environmental consequences</a> (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or concrete projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "environmental impact assessment" (EIA) is usually used when applied to concrete projects by individuals or companies and the term "strategic environmental assessment" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state (Fischer, 2016). Environmental assessments may be governed by rules of <a href="/wiki/Administrative_law" title="Administrative law">administrative procedure</a> regarding public participation and documentation of decision making, and may be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Air_quality">Air quality</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Air_quality_law" title="Air quality law">Air quality law</a></div>
<p>Air quality laws govern the emission of <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollutants</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. A specialized subset of air quality laws regulate <a href="/wiki/Indoor_air_quality" title="Indoor air quality">the quality of air inside buildings</a>. Air quality laws are often designed specifically to protect human health by limiting or eliminating airborne pollutant concentrations. Other initiatives are designed to address broader ecological problems, such as limitations on chemicals that affect the <a href="/wiki/Ozone_layer" title="Ozone layer">ozone layer</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">emissions trading</a> programs to address <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> or <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">climate change</a>. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing air pollutants, setting limits on acceptable emissions levels, and dictating necessary or appropriate mitigation technologies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_quality">Water quality</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Water_quality_law" title="Water quality law">Water quality law</a></div>
<p>Water quality laws govern the <a href="/wiki/Water_pollution" title="Water pollution">release of pollutants into water resources</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ground_water" title="Ground water">ground water</a>, and stored <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a>. Some water quality laws, such as drinking water regulations, may be designed solely with reference to human health. Many others, including restrictions on the alteration of the <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">chemical, physical, radiological, and biological characteristics of water resources</a>, may also reflect efforts to protect <a href="/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem" title="Aquatic ecosystem">aquatic ecosystems</a> more broadly. Regulatory efforts may include identifying and categorizing water pollutants, dictating acceptable pollutant concentrations in water resources, and limiting pollutant discharges from effluent sources. Regulatory areas include <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">sewage treatment and disposal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Industrial_wastewater_treatment" title="Industrial wastewater treatment">industrial</a> and <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_wastewater_treatment" title="Agricultural wastewater treatment">agricultural</a> waste water management, and control of <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" title="Surface runoff">surface runoff</a> from construction sites and urban environments.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Waste_management_law" title="Waste management law">Waste management law</a></div>
<p>Waste management laws govern the transport, treatment, storage, and disposal of all manner of <a href="/wiki/Waste" title="Waste">waste</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hazardous_waste" title="Hazardous waste">hazardous waste</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_waste" title="Radioactive waste">nuclear waste</a>, among <a href="/wiki/List_of_waste_types" title="List of waste types">many other types</a>. Waste laws are generally designed to minimize or eliminate the uncontrolled dispersal of waste materials into the environment in a manner that may cause ecological or biological harm, and include laws designed to reduce the generation of waste and promote or mandate waste recycling. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing waste types and mandating transport, treatment, storage, and disposal practices.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Environmental_cleanup_law" title="Environmental cleanup law">Environmental cleanup law</a></div>
<p>Environmental cleanup laws govern the removal of <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contaminant" title="Contaminant">contaminants</a> from environmental media such as <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sediment" title="Sediment">sediment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ground_water" title="Ground water">ground water</a>. Unlike pollution control laws, cleanup laws are designed to respond after-the-fact to environmental contamination, and consequently must often define not only the necessary response actions, but also the parties who may be responsible for undertaking (or paying for) such actions. Regulatory requirements may include rules for emergency response, liability allocation, site assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility studies, remedial action, post-remedial monitoring, and site reuse.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_safety">Chemical safety</span></h3>
<p>Chemical safety laws govern the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemicals" title="Chemicals">chemicals</a> in human activities, particularly man-made chemicals in modern industrial applications. As contrasted with media-oriented environmental laws (e.g., air or water quality laws), chemical control laws seek to manage the (potential) pollutants themselves. Regulatory efforts include banning specific chemical constituents in consumer products (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Bisphenol_A" title="Bisphenol A">Bisphenol A</a> in plastic bottles), and regulating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Mining_law" title="Mining law">Mining law</a></div>
<p>Mineral resource laws cover several basic topics, including the ownership of the mineral resource and who can work them. Mining is also affected by various regulations regarding the health and safety of miners, as well as the environmental impact of mining.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Forest_resources">Forest resources</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Forestry_law" title="Forestry law">Forestry law</a></div>
<p>Forestry laws govern activities in designated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forests" title="Forests">forest lands</a>, most commonly with respect to <a href="/wiki/Forestry" title="Forestry">forest management</a> and <a href="/wiki/Logging" title="Logging">timber harvesting</a>. Ancillary laws may regulate forest land acquisition and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prescribed_burn" title="Prescribed burn">prescribed burn</a> practices. Forest management laws generally adopt management policies, such as <a href="/wiki/Multiple_use" title="Multiple use">multiple use</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sustained_yield" title="Sustained yield">sustained yield</a>, by which public forest resources are to be managed. Governmental agencies are generally responsible for planning and implementing forestry laws on public forest lands, and may be involved in forest inventory, planning, and conservation, and oversight of timber sales. Broader initiatives may seek to slow or reverse <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wildlife_and_plants">Wildlife and plants</span></h3>
<p>Wildlife laws govern the potential impact of human activity on wild animals, whether directly on individuals or populations, or indirectly via habitat degradation. Similar laws may operate to protect plant species. Such laws may be enacted entirely to protect <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, or as a means for protecting species deemed important for other reasons. Regulatory efforts may including the creation of special <a href="/wiki/Conservation_status" title="Conservation status">conservation statuses</a>, prohibitions on killing, harming, or disturbing protected species, efforts to induce and support species recovery, establishment of wildlife refuges to support conservation, and prohibitions on trafficking in species or animal parts to combat <a href="/wiki/Poaching" title="Poaching">poaching</a>.</p>

Such laws may restrict the days to harvest fish or game, the number of animals caught per person, the species harvested, or the weapons or fishing gear used. Such laws may seek to balance dueling needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">environment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Population_biology" title="Population biology">populations</a> of fish and game. Game laws can provide a legal structure to collect <a href="/wiki/License" title="License">license</a> fees and other <a href="/wiki/Federal_Duck_Stamp" title="Federal Duck Stamp">money</a> which is used to fund <a href="/wiki/Wildlife_conservation" title="Wildlife conservation">conservation</a> efforts as well as to obtain harvest information used in <a href="/wiki/Wildlife_management" title="Wildlife management">wildlife management</a> practice.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Important_principles">Important principles</span></h2>
<p>Environmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness of and concern over issues impacting the entire world. While laws have developed piecemeal and for a variety of reasons, some effort has gone into identifying key concepts and guiding principles common to environmental law as a whole. The principles discussed below are not an exhaustive list and are not universally recognized or accepted. Nonetheless, they represent important principles for the understanding of environmental law around the world.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sustainable_Development">Sustainable Development</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">Sustainable development</a></div>
<p>Defined by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a> as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> may be considered together with the concepts of "integration" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and "interdependence" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent). Laws mandating <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment" title="Environmental impact assessment">environmental impact assessment</a> and requiring or encouraging development to minimize environmental impacts may be assessed against this principle.</p>
<p>The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_the_Human_Environment" title="United Nations Conference on the Human Environment">United Nations Conference on the Human Environment</a> (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Commission_on_Environment_and_Development" title="World Commission on Environment and Development">World Commission on Environment and Development</a> (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a> resulted in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rio_Declaration" title="Rio Declaration">Rio Declaration</a>, Principle 3 of which reads: "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations." Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit_2002" title="Earth Summit 2002">World Summit on Sustainable Development</a> (Earth Summit 2002), and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Sustainable_Development" title="United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development">United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development</a> (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Equity">Equity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Intergenerational_equity" title="Intergenerational equity">Intergenerational equity</a></div>
<p>Defined by UNEP to include intergenerational equity - "the right of future generations to enjoy a fair level of the common patrimony" - and intragenerational equity - "the right of all people within the current generation to fair access to the current generation's entitlement to the Earth's natural resources" - environmental equity considers the present generation under an obligation to account for long-term impacts of activities, and to act to sustain the global environment and resource base for future generations. Pollution control and resource management laws may be assessed against this principle.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transboundary_responsibility">Transboundary responsibility</span></h3>
<p>Defined in the international law context as an obligation to protect one's own environment, and to prevent damage to neighboring environments, UNEP considers transboundary responsibility at the international level as a potential limitation on the rights of the <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">sovereign state</a>. Laws that act to limit <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Externalities" title="Externalities">externalities</a> imposed upon human health and the environment may be assessed against this principle.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_participation_and_transparency">Public participation and transparency</span></h3>
<p>Identified as essential conditions for "accountable governments . . ., industrial concerns," and organizations generally, public participation and transparency are presented by UNEP as requiring "effective protection of the human right to hold and express opinions and to seek, receive and impart ideas," "a right of access to appropriate, comprehensible and timely information held by governments and industrial concerns on economic and social policies regarding the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment, without imposing undue financial burdens upon the applicants and with adequate protection of privacy and business confidentiality," and "effective judicial and administrative proceedings." These principles are present in <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment" title="Environmental impact assessment">environmental impact assessment</a>, laws requiring publication and access to relevant environmental data, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Administrative_procedure" title="Administrative procedure">administrative procedure</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Precautionary_principle">Precautionary principle</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Precautionary_principle" title="Precautionary principle">Precautionary principle</a></div>
<p>One of the most commonly encountered and controversial principles of environmental law, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rio_Declaration" title="Rio Declaration">Rio Declaration</a> formulated the precautionary principle as follows:</p>

<p>The principle may play a role in any debate over the need for environmental regulation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prevention">Prevention</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Polluter_pays_principle">Polluter pays principle</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Polluter_pays_principle" title="Polluter pays principle">Polluter pays principle</a></div>
<p>The polluter pays principle stands for the idea that "the environmental costs of economic activities, including the cost of preventing potential harm, should be internalized rather than imposed upon society at large." All issues related to responsibility for cost for <a href="/wiki/Environmental_remediation" title="Environmental remediation">environmental remediation</a> and compliance with pollution control regulations involve this principle.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Early examples of legal enactments designed to consciously preserve the environment, for its own sake or human enjoyment, are found throughout history. In the <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a>, the primary protection was found in the law of <a href="/wiki/Nuisance_in_English_law" title="Nuisance in English law">nuisance</a>, but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pig_sty" title="Pig sty">pig stys</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strict_liability" title="Strict liability">strict liability</a> against dumping rubbish, or damage from exploding dams. Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. During the "<a href="/wiki/Great_Stink" title="Great Stink">Great Stink</a>" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. Ironically, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Commission_of_Sewers_Act_1848" title="Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848">Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848</a> had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close <a href="/wiki/Cesspit" title="Cesspit">cesspits</a> around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the <a href="/wiki/London_sewerage_system" title="London sewerage system">London sewerage system</a>. London also suffered from terrible air pollution, and this culminated in the "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Smog" title="Great Smog">Great Smog</a>" of 1952, which in turn triggered its on legislative response: the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956" title="Clean Air Act 1956">Clean Air Act 1956</a>. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding early analogues, the concept of "environmental law" as a separate and distinct body of law is a twentieth-century development. The recognition that the natural environment was fragile and in need of special legal protections, the translation of that recognition into legal structures, the development of those structures into a larger body of "environmental law," and the strong influence of environmental law on natural resource laws, did not occur until about the 1960s. At that time, numerous influences - including a growing awareness of the unity and fragility of the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>; increased public concern over the impact of industrial activity on natural resources and human health; the increasing strength of the regulatory state; and more broadly the advent and success of <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmentalism as a political movement</a> - coalesced to produce a huge new body of law in a relatively short period of time. While the modern history of environmental law is one of continuing controversy, by the end of the twentieth century environmental law had been established as a component of the legal landscape in all <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed nations</a> of the world, many <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">developing ones</a>, and the larger project of <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Environmental law is a continuing source of controversy. Debates over the necessity, fairness, and cost of environmental regulation are ongoing, as well as regarding the appropriateness of regulations vs. market solutions to achieve even agreed-upon ends.</p>
<p>Allegations of scientific uncertainty fuel the <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">ongoing debate</a> over greenhouse gas regulation, and are a major factor in debates over whether to ban particular pesticides. In cases where the science is well-settled, it is not unusual to find that corporations intentionally hide or distort the facts, or sow confusion.</p>
<p>It is very common for regulated industry to argue against environmental regulation on the basis of cost. Difficulties arise in performing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> of environmental issues. It is <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_valuation" title="Ecosystem valuation">difficult to quantify</a> the value of an environmental value such as a healthy ecosystem, clean air, or species diversity. Many environmentalists' response to pitting economy vs. ecology is summed up by former Senator and founder of <a href="/wiki/Earth_Day" title="Earth Day">Earth Day</a> <a href="/wiki/Gaylord_Nelson" title="Gaylord Nelson">Gaylord Nelson</a>, "The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around." Furthermore, environmental issues are seen by many as having an <a href="/wiki/Environmental_ethics" title="Environmental ethics">ethical or moral</a> dimension, which would transcend financial cost. Even so, there are some efforts underway to systemically recognize environmental costs and assets, and account for them properly in economic terms.</p>
<p>While affected industries spark controversy in fighting regulation, there are also many environmentalists and public interest groups who believe that current regulations are inadequate, and advocate for stronger protection. Environmental law conferences - such as the annual <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oregon_School_of_Law#Public_Interest_Environmental_Law_Conference" title="University of Oregon School of Law">Public Interest Environmental Law Conference</a> in Eugene, Oregon - typically have this focus, also connecting environmental law with class, race, and other issues.</p>
<p>An additional debate is to what extent environmental laws are fair to all regulated parties. For instance, researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg highlight how smaller organizations can often incur disproportionately larger costs as a result of environmental regulations, which can ultimately create an additional barrier to entry for new firms, thus stifling competition and innovation.</p>

<p>Global and regional environmental issues are increasingly the subject of <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a>. Debates over environmental concerns implicate core principles of international law and have been the subject of numerous international agreements and declarations.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Customary_international_law" title="Customary international law">Customary international law</a> is an important source of international environmental law. These are the norms and rules that countries follow as a matter of custom and they are so prevalent that they bind all states in the world. When a principle becomes customary law is not clear cut and many arguments are put forward by states not wishing to be bound. Examples of customary international law relevant to the environment include the duty to warn other states promptly about icons of an environmental nature and environmental damages to which another state or states may be exposed, and Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration ('good neighbourliness' or sic utere).</p>
<p>Numerous <a href="/wiki/List_of_international_environmental_agreements" title="List of international environmental agreements">legally binding international agreements</a> encompass a wide variety of issue-areas, from terrestrial, marine and atmospheric pollution through to wildlife and biodiversity protection. International environmental agreements are generally <a href="/wiki/Multilateral_treaty" title="Multilateral treaty">multilateral</a> (or sometimes <a href="/wiki/Bilateral_treaty" title="Bilateral treaty">bilateral</a>) <a href="/wiki/Treaty" title="Treaty">treaties</a> (a.k.a. convention, agreement, protocol, etc.). <a href="/wiki/Treaty#Protocols" title="Treaty">Protocols</a> are subsidiary agreements built from a primary treaty. They exist in many areas of international law but are especially useful in the environmental field, where they may be used to regularly incorporate recent scientific knowledge. They also permit countries to reach agreement on a framework that would be contentious if every detail were to be agreed upon in advance. The most widely known protocol in international environmental law is the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>, which followed from the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>.</p>
<p>While the bodies that proposed, argued, agreed upon and ultimately adopted existing international agreements vary according to each agreement, certain conferences, including 1972's <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_the_Human_Environment" title="United Nations Conference on the Human Environment">United Nations Conference on the Human Environment</a>, 1983's <a href="/wiki/Brundtland_Commission" title="Brundtland Commission">World Commission on Environment and Development</a>, 1992's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth_Summit_(1992)" title="Earth Summit (1992)">United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</a> and 2002's <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit_2002" title="Earth Summit 2002">World Summit on Sustainable Development</a> have been particularly important. <a href="/wiki/Multilateral_environmental_agreement" title="Multilateral environmental agreement">Multilateral environmental agreements</a> sometimes create an International Organization, Institution or Body responsible for implementing the agreement. Major examples are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Convention_on_International_Trade_in_Endangered_Species_of_Wild_Fauna_and_Flora" title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) and the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).</p>
<p>International environmental law also includes the opinions of international courts and tribunals. While there are few and they have limited authority, the decisions carry much weight with legal commentators and are quite influential on the development of international environmental law. One of the biggest challenges in international decisions is to determine an adequate compensation for environmental damages. The courts include the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ); the international Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS); the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a>; <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> and other regional treaty tribunals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Africa">Africa</span></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/International_Network_for_Environmental_Compliance_and_Enforcement" title="International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement">International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement</a> (INECE), the major environmental issues in Africa are “drought and flooding, air pollution, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, freshwater availability, degradation of soil and vegetation, and widespread poverty.”  The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="U.S. Environmental Protection Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) is focused on the “growing urban and industrial pollution, water quality, electronic waste and indoor air from cookstoves.”  They hope to provide enough aid on concerns regarding pollution before their impacts contaminate the African environment as well as the global environment. By doing so, they intend to “protect human health, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and the poor.”  In order to accomplish these goals in Africa, EPA programs are focused on strengthening the ability to enforce environmental laws as well as public compliance to them. Other programs work on developing stronger environmental laws, regulations, and standards.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Asia">Asia</span></h3>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> issues secondary legislation on environmental issues that are valid throughout the EU (so called regulations) and many directives that must be implemented into national legislation from the 28 member states (national states). Examples are the Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 on the implementation of CITES; or the Natura 2000 network the centerpiece for nature &amp; biodiversity policy, encompassing the bird Directive (79/409/EEC/ changed to 2009/147/EC)and the habitats directive (92/43/EEC). Which are made up of multiple SACs (Special Areas of Conservation, linked to the habitats directive) &amp; SPAs (Special Protected Areas, linked to the bird directive), throughout Europe.</p>
<p>EU legislation is ruled in Article 249 Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Topics for common EU legislation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Air pollution</li>
<li>Water protection and management</li>
<li>Waste management</li>
<li>Soil protection</li>
<li>Protection of nature, species and biodiversity</li>

<p>With the enactment of the <a href="/wiki/2008_Constitution_of_Ecuador" title="2008 Constitution of Ecuador">2008 Constitution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> became the first country in the world to codify the <a href="/wiki/Rights_of_Nature" title="Rights of Nature">Rights of Nature</a>. The Constitution, specifically Articles 10 and 71-74, recognizes the inalienable rights of <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights. The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property and legalize and manage degradation of the environment rather than prevent it.</p>
<p>The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_industry" title="Oil industry">oil industry</a>, most famously the <a href="/wiki/Chevron_Corporation#Environmental_damage_in_Ecuador" title="Chevron Corporation">class-action litigation</a> against <a href="/wiki/Chevron_Corporation" title="Chevron Corporation">Chevron</a>, and the failure of an extraction-based economy and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neoliberal" title="Neoliberal">neoliberal</a> reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime, led by President <a href="/wiki/Rafael_Correa" title="Rafael Correa">Rafael Correa</a>, and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "Buen Vivir," or good living—focused on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth—gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.</p>
<p>The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of "Buen Vivir" originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of "Buen Vivir." </p>
