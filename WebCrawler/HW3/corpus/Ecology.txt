<p><b>Ecology</b> (from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">οἶκος</span>, "house", or "environment"; -λογία, "study of") is the <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">scientific</a> analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment.

Ecology includes the study of interactions <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a> have with each other, other organisms, and with <a href="/wiki/Abiotic_component" title="Abiotic component">abiotic components</a> of their <a href="/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)" title="Environment (biophysical)">environment</a>. Topics of interest to ecologists include the <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">diversity</a>, distribution, amount (<a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>), and number (<a href="/wiki/Population" title="Population">population</a>) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystems" title="Ecosystems">Ecosystems</a> are composed of dynamically interacting parts including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organisms" title="Organisms">organisms</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Community_(ecology)" title="Community (ecology)">communities</a> they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as <a href="/wiki/Primary_production" title="Primary production">primary production</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pedogenesis" title="Pedogenesis">pedogenesis</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nutrient_cycling" title="Nutrient cycling">nutrient cycling</a>, and various <a href="/wiki/Niche_construction" title="Niche construction">niche construction</a> activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment.

<p>Ecology is not synonymous with environment, <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a>, natural history, or <a href="/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">environmental science</a>. It is closely related to <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_biology" title="Evolutionary biology">evolutionary biology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ethology" title="Ethology">ethology</a>. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain:</p>

For example, the <i><a href="/wiki/Circles_of_Sustainability" title="Circles of Sustainability">Circles of Sustainability</a></i> approach treats ecology as more than the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and <a href="/wiki/Resource_(biology)" title="Resource (biology)">resources</a> compose <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a> which, in turn, maintain <a href="/wiki/Biophysics" title="Biophysics">biophysical</a> feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living (<a href="/wiki/Biotic_component" title="Biotic component">biotic</a>) and non-living (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abiotic" title="Abiotic">abiotic</a>) components of the planet.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Integrative_level" title="Integrative level">Integrative level</a></div>
<p>The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>) to a planetary scale (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_spheres" title="Earth's spheres">biosphere</a>) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phenomena" title="Phenomena">phenomena</a>. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic <a href="/wiki/Resource_(biology)" title="Resource (biology)">resources</a> and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into <a href="/wiki/Population" title="Population">populations</a> which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain <a href="/wiki/Ecological_succession" title="Ecological succession">successional stages</a> of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an <a href="/wiki/Aphid" title="Aphid">aphid</a> population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacterial</a> communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.</p>

<p>System behaviors must first be arrayed into different levels of organization. Behaviors corresponding to higher levels occur at slow rates. Conversely, lower organizational levels exhibit rapid rates. For example, individual tree leaves respond rapidly to momentary changes in light intensity, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and the like. The growth of the tree responds more slowly and integrates these short-term changes.</p>

<p>The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystems" title="Ecosystems">ecosystems</a> hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, <a href="/wiki/Landscape" title="Landscape">landscape</a>, and chronological scales.</p>
<p>To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_classification" title="Biological classification">nested hierarchy</a>, ranging in scale from <a href="/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Tissue_(biology)" title="Tissue (biology)">tissues</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)" title="Organ (anatomy)">organs</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Population_ecology" title="Population ecology">populations</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Community_(ecology)" title="Community (ecology)">communities</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">biomes</a>, and up to the level of the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>.

<p>Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes.

<p>Biodiversity (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization. Biodiversity includes <a href="/wiki/Species_diversity" title="Species diversity">species diversity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_diversity" title="Ecosystem diversity">ecosystem diversity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Genetic_diversity" title="Genetic diversity">genetic diversity</a> and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels. Biodiversity plays an important role in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystem_service" title="Ecosystem service">ecosystem services</a> which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life. Preventing <a href="/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">species extinctions</a> is one way to preserve biodiversity and that goal rests on techniques that preserve genetic diversity, habitat and the ability for species to migrate. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. <a href="/wiki/Natural_capital" title="Natural capital">Natural capital</a> that supports populations is critical for maintaining <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_services" title="Ecosystem services">ecosystem services</a> and species <a href="/wiki/Animal_migration" title="Animal migration">migration</a> (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">Habitat</a></div>
<p>The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result. More specifically, "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal." For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Montane_ecosystem" title="Montane ecosystem">montane</a> or <a href="/wiki/Alpine_tundra" title="Alpine tundra">alpine</a> ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizards (<i>Tropidurus hispidus</i>) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. <a href="/wiki/Biotope" title="Biotope">Biotope</a> and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, some species are <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_engineer" title="Ecosystem engineer">ecosystem engineers</a>, altering the environment within a localized region. For instance, beavers manage water levels by building dams which improves their habitat in a landscape.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Niche">Niche</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ecological_niche" title="Ecological niche">Ecological niche</a></div>

<p>Definitions of the niche date back to 1917, but <a href="/wiki/G._Evelyn_Hutchinson" title="G. Evelyn Hutchinson">G. Evelyn Hutchinson</a> made conceptual advances in 1957 by introducing a widely adopted definition: "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes." The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the <i>fundamental</i> and the <i>realized</i> niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists. The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a "<a href="/wiki/Euclidean_space" title="Euclidean space">Euclidean</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/N-dimensional_space" title="N-dimensional space">hyperspace</a> whose <i>dimensions</i> are defined as environmental variables and whose <i>size</i> is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has <i>positive fitness</i>."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biogeography" title="Biogeography">Biogeographical</a> patterns and <a href="/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">range</a> distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species' <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trait_(biology)" title="Trait (biology)">traits</a> and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, <a href="/wiki/Phenotype" title="Phenotype">phenotype</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Phenotypic_trait" title="Phenotypic trait">characteristic</a> of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The <a href="/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle" title="Competitive exclusion principle">competitive exclusion principle</a> states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting <a href="/wiki/Resource_(biology)" title="Resource (biology)">resource</a>; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the <a href="/wiki/Ecotope" title="Ecotope">ecotope</a>, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystem_engineering" title="Ecosystem engineering">Ecosystem engineering</a></div>
<p>Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The <a href="/wiki/Negative_feedback" title="Negative feedback">regulatory feedback</a> between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a <a href="/wiki/Beaver" title="Beaver">beaver</a> <a href="/wiki/Pond" title="Pond">pond</a>) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silica" title="Silica">silica</a> skeleton deposits from marine organisms. The process and concept of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystem_engineering" title="Ecosystem engineering">ecosystem engineering</a> is related to <a href="/wiki/Niche_construction" title="Niche construction">niche construction</a>, but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: "organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats."</p>
<p>The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term "niche construction" is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche. An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_insects" title="Social insects">social insects</a>, including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent <a href="/wiki/Homeostasis" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a> or <a href="/wiki/Homeorhesis" title="Homeorhesis">homeorhesis</a> in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biome">Biome</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">Biome</a></div>
<p>Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include <a href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest" title="Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest">temperate broadleaf and mixed forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Temperate_deciduous_forest" title="Temperate deciduous forest">temperate deciduous forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hot_desert" title="Hot desert">hot desert</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Polar_desert" title="Polar desert">polar desert</a>. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbiome" title="Microbiome">microbiomes</a>. To a microbe, the human body is a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in <a href="/wiki/Molecular_genetics" title="Molecular genetics">molecular genetics</a>, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet.

<p>The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. <a href="/wiki/Ecological_relationship" title="Ecological relationship">Ecological relationships</a> regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the <a href="/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis" title="Gaia hypothesis">Gaia hypothesis</a> is an example of <a href="/wiki/Holism" title="Holism">holism</a> applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feedback_loop" title="Feedback loop">feedback loop</a> generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.</p>

<p>Understanding traits of individual organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution that focus on such traits are <a href="/wiki/Life_history_theory" title="Life history theory">life history theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecophysiology" title="Ecophysiology">ecophysiology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology" title="Metabolic theory of ecology">metabolic theory of ecology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ethology" title="Ethology">Ethology</a>. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits may be related to structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>One set of characteristics relate to body size and temperature. The <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology" title="Metabolic theory of ecology">metabolic theory of ecology</a> provides a predictive qualitative set of relationships between an organism’s body size and temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and this results in a variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.</p>
<p>The traits of organisms are subject to change through acclimation, development, and evolution. For this reason, individuals form a shared focus for ecology and for <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_ecology" title="Evolutionary ecology">evolutionary ecology</a>.</p>

<p>Population ecology studies the dynamics of specie populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.</p>
<p>A primary law of population ecology is the <a href="/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model" title="Malthusian growth model">Malthusian growth model</a> which states, "a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant." Simplified population <a href="/wiki/Scientific_modelling" title="Scientific modelling">models</a> usually start with four variables: death, birth, <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Emigration" title="Emigration">emigration</a>.</p>
<p>An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Random" title="Random">random</a> processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:</p>

<p>where <i>N</i> is the total number of individuals in the population, <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and <i>r</i> is the per capita rate of population change.</p>
<p>Using these modelling techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_population_growth" title="Law of population growth">logistic equation</a>:</p>

<p>where <i>N</i> is the number of individuals measured as <a href="/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)" title="Biomass (ecology)">biomass</a> density, <i>a</i> is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and <i>K</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> of the population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (<i>dN/dT</i>) is equal to growth (<i>aN</i>) that is limited by carrying capacity (1 – <i>N</i>/<i>K</i>).</p>
<p>Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include <a href="/wiki/Biological_life_cycle" title="Biological life cycle">life history</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fecundity" title="Fecundity">fecundity</a>, and survivorship, and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as <a href="/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrix algebra</a>. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas. In cases where basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods, such as the <a href="/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion" title="Akaike information criterion">Akaike information criterion</a>, or use models that can become mathematically complex as "several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data."</p>

<p>The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969 as "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize". Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in <a href="/wiki/Conservation_biology" title="Conservation biology">conservation research</a>. Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality, and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat. Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.</p>
<p>In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of <a href="/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" title="Juvenile (organism)">juveniles</a> that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Field_study" title="Field study">field studies</a> to explain metapopulation structure.</p>

<p>Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure <a href="/wiki/Primary_production" title="Primary production">primary production</a> (g C/m^2) in a <a href="/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetland</a> in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y). This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants (i.e., primary producers) and the decomposers (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a> and bacteria),</p>
<p>The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of <a href="/wiki/George_Perkins_Marsh" title="George Perkins Marsh">George Perkins Marsh</a> ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_ecosystem" title="Terrestrial ecosystem">terrestrial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freshwater_ecosystem" title="Freshwater ecosystem">freshwater</a>, atmospheric, or <a href="/wiki/Marine_ecosystem" title="Marine ecosystem">marine</a>. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each.

<p>A food web is the archetypal <a href="/wiki/Ecological_network" title="Ecological network">ecological network</a>.

As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herbivores" title="Herbivores">herbivores</a>, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal <a href="/wiki/Trophic_species" title="Trophic species">trophic species</a> to a top consumer is called the <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chain</a>. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of <a href="/wiki/Concept_map" title="Concept map">concept map</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Heuristic" title="Heuristic">heuristic</a> device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.</p>

<p>Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web <a href="/wiki/Microcosm_(experimental_ecosystem)" title="Microcosm (experimental ecosystem)">microcosm</a> studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.</p>
<p>Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Omnivores" title="Omnivores">omnivores</a>) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Predator" title="Predator">primary predators</a>). Theoretical and empirical studies identify <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Random#In_biology" title="Random">non-random</a> emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Trophic_levels">Trophic levels</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Trophic_level" title="Trophic level">Trophic level</a></div>

<p>A trophic level (from Greek <i>troph</i>, τροφή, trophē, meaning "food" or "feeding") is "a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the adjacent level nearer the abiotic source." Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trophism" title="Trophism">trophism</a> among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the <a href="/wiki/Relative_species_abundance" title="Relative species abundance">abundance</a> or biomass at each level. When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a 'pyramid of numbers'.</p>
<p>Species are broadly categorized as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autotrophs" title="Autotrophs">autotrophs</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Primary_producers" title="Primary producers">primary producers</a>), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heterotrophs" title="Heterotrophs">heterotrophs</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Consumer" title="Consumer">consumers</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Detritivore" title="Detritivore">Detritivores</a> (or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decomposers" title="Decomposers">decomposers</a>). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or <a href="/wiki/Chemosynthesis" title="Chemosynthesis">chemosynthesis</a>. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primary_consumers" title="Primary consumers">primary consumers</a> (strict herbivores), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trophic_dynamics" title="Trophic dynamics">secondary consumers</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carnivorous" title="Carnivorous">carnivorous</a> predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.</p>
<p>Trophic levels are part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holistic" title="Holistic">holistic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Complex_systems" title="Complex systems">complex systems</a> view of ecosystems. Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system. While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to "reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction." Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but "above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores."</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Keystone_species">Keystone species</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species">Keystone species</a></div>

<p>A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food-web" title="Food-web">food-web</a>. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sea_otter" title="Sea otter">Sea otters</a> (<i>Enhydra lutris</i>) are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea_urchins" title="Sea urchins">sea urchins</a> that feed on <a href="/wiki/Kelp" title="Kelp">kelp</a>. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the <a href="/wiki/Steller%27s_sea_cow" title="Steller's sea cow">Steller's sea cow</a> (<i>Hydrodamalis gigas</i>). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a <a href="/wiki/Conservation_biology" title="Conservation biology">conservation</a> tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecological_complexity">Ecological complexity</span></h2>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">Emergence</a></div>
<p>Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This <a href="/wiki/Biocomplexity" title="Biocomplexity">biocomplexity</a> stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecotones" title="Ecotones">ecotones</a> spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. "What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one." Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.</p>
<p>"Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric." From these principles, ecologists have identified <a href="/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Self-organization#Self-organization_in_biology" title="Self-organization">self-organizing</a> phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level. Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history. Long-term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER). The longest experiment in existence is the <a href="/wiki/Park_Grass_Experiment" title="Park Grass Experiment">Park Grass Experiment</a>, which was initiated in 1856. Another example is the <a href="/wiki/Hubbard_Brook_Experimental_Forest" title="Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest">Hubbard Brook study</a>, which has been in operation since 1960.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holism">Holism</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Holism" title="Holism">Holism</a></div>
<p>Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the <a href="/wiki/Biological_organisation" title="Biological organisation">biological organization</a> of life that <a href="/wiki/Systems_biology" title="Systems biology">self-organizes</a> into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>, cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts. "New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed."</p>
<p>Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reductionistic" title="Reductionistic">reductionistic</a>. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biomolecular" title="Biomolecular">biomolecular</a> properties of the exterior shells.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_ecology" title="Evolutionary ecology">Evolutionary ecology</a></div>
<p>Ecology and evolution are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">Natural selection</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biological_life_cycle" title="Biological life cycle">life history</a>, <a href="/wiki/Developmental_biology" title="Developmental biology">development</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adaptation" title="Adaptation">adaptation</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Populations" title="Populations">populations</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Heredity" title="Heredity">inheritance</a> are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as <a href="/wiki/Phylogenetics" title="Phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" title="Linnaean taxonomy">Linnaean system of taxonomy</a>. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trends_in_Ecology_and_Evolution" title="Trends in Ecology and Evolution">Trends in Ecology and Evolution</a></i>. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavioural_ecology">Behavioural ecology</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Behavioural_ecology" title="Behavioural ecology">Behavioural ecology</a></div>

<p>All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, including memory and communication. Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile <a href="/wiki/Sperm" title="Sperm">sperm</a> of plants, mobile <a href="/wiki/Phytoplankton" title="Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a> swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weevils" title="Weevils">weevils</a>, the mating dance of a <a href="/wiki/Salamander" title="Salamander">salamander</a>, or social gatherings of <a href="/wiki/Amoeba" title="Amoeba">amoeba</a>.</p>
<p>Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology. Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.</p>
<p>Predator-prey interactions are an introductory concept into food-web studies as well as behavioural ecology. Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency. For example, "[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk" or "[t]he optimal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Escape_distance" title="Escape distance">flight initiation distance</a> occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk."</p>

<p>Elaborate sexual <a href="/wiki/Display_(zoology)" title="Display (zoology)">displays</a> and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals.

Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. <a href="/wiki/Kin_selection" title="Kin selection">Kin selection</a> explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including <a href="/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wasp" title="Wasp">wasps</a> are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are <a href="/wiki/Clones" title="Clones">clones</a> that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, <a href="/wiki/Group_selection" title="Group selection">group selectionists</a> find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coevolution">Coevolution</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Coevolution" title="Coevolution">Coevolution</a></div>

<p>Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a <a href="/wiki/Host_(biology)" title="Host (biology)">host</a> and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interspecific_interaction" title="Interspecific interaction">within a species</a> that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mutualisms" title="Mutualisms">mutualisms</a>. Examples of mutualism include <a href="/wiki/Fungus-growing_ants" title="Fungus-growing ants">fungus-growing ants</a> employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the <a href="/wiki/Fig_wasp" title="Fig wasp">fig wasp</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yucca_moth" title="Yucca moth">yucca moth</a> pollination complex, <a href="/wiki/Lichen" title="Lichen">lichens</a> with fungi and photosynthetic <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Coral" title="Coral">corals</a> with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called <a href="/wiki/Symbiosis" title="Symbiosis">symbiosis</a>. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arbuscular_mycorrhizal_fungi" title="Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi">arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</a> living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nutrients" title="Nutrients">mineral nutrients</a>.</p>
<p>Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called <a href="/wiki/Commensalism" title="Commensalism">commensalism</a>; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called <a href="/wiki/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">parasitism</a>. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or <a href="/wiki/Propagule" title="Propagule">propagules</a>, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_Queen_Hypothesis" title="Red Queen Hypothesis">Red Queen Hypothesis</a>, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biogeography">Biogeography</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biogeography" title="Biogeography">Biogeography</a></div>
<p>Biogeography (an amalgamation of <i>biology</i> and <i>geography</i>) is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The <i><a href="/wiki/Journal_of_Biogeography" title="Journal of Biogeography">Journal of Biogeography</a></i> was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Island_biogeography" title="Island biogeography">the theory of island biogeography</a>, published by the mathematician Robert MacArthur and ecologist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Edward_O._Wilson" title="Edward O. Wilson">Edward O. Wilson</a> in 1967 is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.</p>
<p>Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as <a href="/wiki/Animal_migration" title="Animal migration">migration</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biological_dispersal" title="Biological dispersal">dispersal</a>. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota.

<p>A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory, one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain <a href="/wiki/Life_history_theory" title="Life history theory">life-history evolution</a>. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Population_densities" title="Population densities">population density</a>. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available <a href="/wiki/Resource_(biology)" title="Resource (biology)">resources</a> for rapid population growth. These early phases of <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a> experience <i>density-independent</i> forces of natural selection, which is called <i>r</i>-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called <i>K</i>-selection.</p>
<p>In the <i>r/K</i>-selection model, the first variable <i>r</i> is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable <i>K</i> is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An <i>r</i>-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of <a href="/wiki/Fecundity" title="Fecundity">fecundity</a> in <i>r</i>-selected species. Many kinds of insects and <a href="/wiki/Invasive_species" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a> exhibit <i>r</i>-selected <a href="/wiki/Phenotypic_trait" title="Phenotypic trait">characteristics</a>. In contrast, a <i>K</i>-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting <i>K</i>-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.</p>

Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nematodes" title="Nematodes">nematodes</a>. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable.

<p>The history of life on Earth has been a history of interaction between living things and their surroundings. To a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the earth's vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment. Considering the whole span of earthly time, the opposite effect, in which life actually modifies its surroundings, has been relatively slight. Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one species man acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world.</p>

<p>Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science. Human ecology is an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interdisciplinary" title="Interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> investigation into the ecology of our species. "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bio-ecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bio-ecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three." The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the <a href="/wiki/Anthropocene" title="Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>.

Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the 21st century "will be the era of restoration in ecology".

<p>The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains <a href="/wiki/Resource_(biology)" title="Resource (biology)">resources</a> for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle. Like "ecology", the term "environment" has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of "nature". Environment "includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation." The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abiotic" title="Abiotic">abiotic</a> factors such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific">conspecifics</a>) and other species that share a habitat.</p>
<p>The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated <a href="/wiki/Materialism" title="Materialism">material</a> parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or <i>holocoenotic</i> system as it was once called. This is known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dialectical" title="Dialectical">dialectical</a> approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or <a href="/wiki/Umwelt" title="Umwelt">umwelt</a>).

<p>Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as a kind of regenerative insurance.</p>

<cite style="display: block; text-align: left;">Ernest et al.</cite></div>
<p>The Earth was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> to one composed mostly of <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">reducing and oxidizing</a> gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.</p>

The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic <a href="/wiki/Methanogen" title="Methanogen">methanogen</a> microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O). <a href="/wiki/Anoxygenic_photosynthesis" title="Anoxygenic photosynthesis">Anoxygenic photosynthesis</a> reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H<sub>2</sub>S + CO<sub>2</sub> + h<i>v</i> → CH<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2S). Early forms of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)" title="Fermentation (biochemistry)">fermentation</a> also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the <i><a href="/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" title="Great Oxygenation Event">Great Oxidation</a></i>) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3 billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1 billion years prior.</p>

<p>Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming <a href="/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)" title="Hypoxia (environmental)">hypoxic</a> (an environment with O<sub>2</sub> concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely <a href="/wiki/Anoxic_waters" title="Anoxic waters">anoxic</a> where <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anaerobic_bacteria" title="Anaerobic bacteria">anaerobic bacteria</a> thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">spectral composition</a> of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (<a href="/wiki/Aerenchyma" title="Aerenchyma">aerenchyma</a>) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Halophytes" title="Halophytes">halophytes</a>) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and <a href="/wiki/Osmoregulation" title="Osmoregulation">osmoregulating</a> their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Estuarine" title="Estuarine">estuarine</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brackish" title="Brackish">brackish</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceanic</a> environments.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravity">Gravity</span></h4>
<p>The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces.

These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (<a href="/wiki/Gravitropism" title="Gravitropism">gravitropism</a>), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the <a href="/wiki/Biomechanics" title="Biomechanics">biomechanics</a> and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The <a href="/wiki/Circulatory_system" title="Circulatory system">cardiovascular systems</a> of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).</p>

On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global <a href="/wiki/Trade_winds" title="Trade winds">trade winds</a>. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence, mixing the <a href="/wiki/Water_column" title="Water column">water column</a> and influencing the environmental profile to create <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermally_layered_zones" title="Thermally layered zones">thermally layered zones</a>, affecting how fish, algae, and other parts of the <a href="/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem" title="Aquatic ecosystem">aquatic ecosystem</a> are structured.

Fire releases CO<sub>2</sub> and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression. While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time, <a href="/wiki/Charles_F._Cooper_(ecologist)" title="Charles F.

<p><a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native North Americans</a> were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires.

Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called <a href="/wiki/Bioturbation" title="Bioturbation">bioturbation</a>. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microorganisms" title="Microorganisms">microorganisms</a> are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. <a href="/wiki/Paleoecology" title="Paleoecology">Paleoecological</a> studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the <a href="/wiki/Tree#Evolutionary_history" title="Tree">evolution of trees</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_life#Colonization_of_land" title="Evolutionary history of life">colonization of land</a> in the Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological trophism in soils.</p>

<p>Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated, flow, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Recycling_(ecological)" title="Recycling (ecological)">recycled</a> through the environment. This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (<a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the <a href="/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle" title="Biogeochemical cycle">biogeochemical cycles</a> of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.</p>
<p>The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic <a href="/wiki/Outgassing" title="Outgassing">outgassing</a>, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">ppm</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Oligocene" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was another significant restructuring of the global <a href="/wiki/Carbon_cycle" title="Carbon cycle">carbon cycle</a> as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, <a href="/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation" title="C4 carbon fixation">C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis</a>, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of <a href="/wiki/Permafrost" title="Permafrost">permafrost</a> are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO<sub>2</sub> on a 100-year time scale. Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_beginnings">Early beginnings</span></h3>
<p>Ecology has a complex origin, due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature. Ancient Greek philosophers such as <a href="/wiki/Hippocrates" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> were among the first to record observations on natural history. However, they viewed life in terms of <a href="/wiki/Essentialism" title="Essentialism">essentialism</a>, where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an <a href="/wiki/Idealism" title="Idealism">idealized type</a>. This contrasts against the modern understanding of <a href="/wiki/Theoretical_ecology" title="Theoretical ecology">ecological theory</a> where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>. Early conceptions of ecology, such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> (died <i>c</i>. 425 BC), who described one of the earliest accounts of <a href="/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)" title="Mutualism (biology)">mutualism</a> in his observation of "natural dentistry". Basking <a href="/wiki/Nile_crocodile" title="Nile crocodile">Nile crocodiles</a>, he noted, would open their mouths to give <a href="/wiki/Sandpiper" title="Sandpiper">sandpipers</a> safe access to pluck <a href="/wiki/Leech" title="Leech">leeches</a> out, giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile. Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology. He and his student <a href="/wiki/Theophrastus" title="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and on their behaviour, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche.</p>
<p>Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of microscopist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antoni_van_Leeuwenhoek" title="Antoni van Leeuwenhoek">Antoni van Leeuwenhoek</a> (1632–1723) and botanist <a href="/wiki/Richard_Bradley_(botanist)" title="Richard Bradley (botanist)">Richard Bradley</a> (1688?–1732). Biogeographer <a href="/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt" title="Alexander von Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> (1769–1859) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along <a href="/wiki/Environmental_gradient" title="Environmental gradient">environmental gradients</a>, such as a <a href="/wiki/Cline_(biology)" title="Cline (biology)">cline</a> forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> as he developed a form of "terrestrial physics". In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships. Natural historians, such as Humboldt, <a href="/wiki/James_Hutton" title="James Hutton">James Hutton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" title="Jean-Baptiste Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences. The term "ecology" (<a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a>: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Oekologie, Ökologie</i></span>) is of a more recent origin and was first coined by the German biologist <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel" title="Ernst Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a> in his book <i>Generelle Morphologie der Organismen</i> (1866). Haeckel was a zoologist, artist, writer, and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy.</p>

<p>By ecology, we mean the whole science of the relations of the organism to the environment including, in the broad sense, all the "conditions of existence. "Thus the theory of evolution explains the housekeeping relations of organisms mechanistically as the necessary consequences of effectual causes and so forms the <a href="/wiki/Monism" title="Monism">monistic</a> groundwork of ecology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<cite style="display: block; text-align: left;">Ernst Haeckel (1866) </cite></div>

<p>Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark Haeckel's definition as the beginning; others say it was <a href="/wiki/Eugenius_Warming" title="Eugenius Warming">Eugenius Warming</a> with the writing of <a href="/wiki/Plantesamfund" title="Plantesamfund">Oecology of Plants: An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities</a> (1895), or <a href="/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century. Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature. His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on the <i>economy or polity of nature</i> in <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species" title="The Origin of Species">The Origin of Species</a></i>. Linnaeus was the first to frame the <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_nature" title="Balance of nature">balance of nature</a> as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.</p>

<p>From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to <i>The Origin of Species</i>, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication <i>Natural History of Selborne</i> by <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_White" title="Gilbert White">Gilbert White</a> (1720–1793), considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology. While <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of <a href="/wiki/Soil_ecology" title="Soil ecology">soil ecology</a>, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in <i>The Origin of Species</i>. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.</p>

<p>Nowhere can one see more clearly illustrated what may be called the sensibility of such an organic complex,--expressed by the fact that whatever affects any species belonging to it, must speedily have its influence of some sort upon the whole assemblage. He will thus be made to see the impossibility of studying any form completely, out of relation to the other forms,--the necessity for taking a comprehensive survey of the whole as a condition to a satisfactory understanding of any part.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Since_1900">Since 1900</span></h3>
<p>Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). Notable scientist <a href="/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards" title="Ellen Swallow Richards">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> may have first introduced the term "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oekology" title="Oekology">oekology</a>" (which eventually morphed into <a href="/wiki/Home_economics" title="Home economics">home economics</a>) in the U.S. as early 1892.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">descriptive form</a> of <a href="/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">natural history</a> to a more <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">analytical form</a> of <i>scientific natural history</i>. <a href="/wiki/Frederic_Clements" title="Frederic Clements">Frederic Clements</a> published the first American ecology book in 1905, presenting the idea of plant communities as a <a href="/wiki/Superorganism" title="Superorganism">superorganism</a>. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seral_development" title="Seral development">seral development</a> that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Henry_Gleason" title="Henry Gleason">Henry Gleason</a>, who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations.</p>
<p>The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an <a href="/wiki/Idealism" title="Idealism">idealistic form</a> of holism. The term "holism" was coined in 1926 by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jan_Christiaan_Smuts" title="Jan Christiaan Smuts">Jan Christiaan Smuts</a>, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements' superorganism concept. Around the same time, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sutherland_Elton" title="Charles Sutherland Elton">Charles Elton</a> pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book <i>Animal Ecology</i>. Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. <a href="/wiki/Alfred_J._Lotka" title="Alfred J. Lotka">Alfred J. Lotka</a> brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.</p>
<p>In 1942, <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Lindeman" title="Raymond Lindeman">Raymond Lindeman</a> wrote a landmark paper on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trophic_dynamics#Trophic_dynamics" title="Trophic dynamics">trophic dynamics</a> of ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. <a href="/wiki/Robert_MacArthur" title="Robert MacArthur">Robert MacArthur</a> advanced mathematical theory, predictions, and tests in ecology in the 1950s, which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists. Ecology also has developed through contributions from other nations, including Russia's <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky" title="Vladimir Vernadsky">Vladimir Vernadsky</a> and his founding of the biosphere concept in the 1920s and Japan's <a href="/wiki/Kinji_Imanishi" title="Kinji Imanishi">Kinji Imanishi</a> and his concepts of harmony in nature and habitat segregation in the 1950s. Scientific recognition of contributions to ecology from non-English-speaking cultures is hampered by language and translation barriers.</p>

<p>This whole chain of poisoning, then, seems to rest on a base of minute plants which must have been the original concentrators. But what of the opposite end of the food chain—the human being who, in probable ignorance of all this sequence of events, has rigged his fishing tackle, caught a string of fish from the waters of Clear Lake, and taken them home to fry for his supper?</p>

<p>Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960–1970s <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a>. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by notable ecologists in the history of <a href="/wiki/Conservation_biology" title="Conservation biology">conservation biology</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Aldo_Leopold" title="Aldo Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Tansley" title="Arthur Tansley">Arthur Tansley</a>, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called <a href="/wiki/Euthenics" title="Euthenics">euthenics</a>) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as <a href="/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards" title="Ellen Swallow Richards">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> and <a href="/wiki/Julia_Lathrop" title="Julia Lathrop">Julia Lathrop</a>, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.</p>
<p>In 1962, marine biologist and ecologist <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Carson" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s book <i><a href="/wiki/Silent_Spring" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a></i> helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulating</a> in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem_health" title="Ecosystem health">ecosystem health</a>. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge their understanding of the degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.</p>
