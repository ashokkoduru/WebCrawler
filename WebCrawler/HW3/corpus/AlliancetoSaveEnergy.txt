<p>The <b>Alliance to Save Energy</b> is a coalition consisting largely of industrial, technological, and energy corporations. The Alliance states that its mission is to "support <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> as a cost-effective energy resource under existing market conditions and advocate energy-efficiency policies that minimize costs to society and individual consumers, and that lessen <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions and their impact on the global climate."  The alliance's chief activities include <a href="/wiki/Public_relations" title="Public relations">public relations</a>, research, and <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" title="Lobbying">lobbying</a> to change <a href="/wiki/Energy_policy_of_the_United_States" title="Energy policy of the United States">U.S. energy policy</a>.</p>
<p>The creation of the Alliance was announced on February 10, 1977 with the support of the then U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. It was the initiative of senators <a href="/wiki/Charles_H._Percy" title="Charles H. Percy">Charles Percy</a> and Hubert Humphrey.</p>

<p>The alliance includes over 170 organizations committed to energy efficiency as a primary way to achieve the nation's environmental, economic, energy security and affordable housing goals.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Support_of_Energy_Independence_and_Security_Act_of_2007">Support of Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007</span></h2>
<p>In 2007, Alliance to Save Energy came out in support of the <a href="/wiki/Energy_Independence_and_Security_Act_of_2007" title="Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007">Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007</a>, which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Banning_of_incandescent_lightbulbs" title="Banning of incandescent lightbulbs">phases out</a> the use of inefficient forms of <a href="/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb" title="Incandescent light bulb">incandescent light bulbs</a> in favor of more energy-efficient lights, such as CFL, halogen incandescents, and LED lights. The purchase price of more efficient lights is typically higher than the purchase price of legacy incandescents. However, the low energy consumption and long life span of high-efficiency lights result in lower <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment" title="Life cycle assessment">life-cycle costs</a> than their legacy incandescent counterparts. Several of the founding member corporations (including <a href="/wiki/Philips" title="Philips">Philips</a>, <a href="/wiki/Panasonic" title="Panasonic">Panasonic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Osram_Sylvania" title="Osram Sylvania">Sylvania</a>) are manufacturers of high-efficiency bulbs. However, all of these corporations are also manufacturers of the incandescent light bulbs that will be phased out of production following passage of the Clean Energy Bill of 2007.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="CarbonCount">CarbonCount</span></h2>
<p>CarbonCount is a metric developed by the Alliance to Save Energy that quantifies the impact of investments in U.S.-based energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects given the expected reduction in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions resulting from each $1,000 of investment. In 2015, Bloomberg New Energy Finance honored CarbonCount with its Finance for Resilience (FiRE) award. FiRE is an open and action-oriented platform that collects, develops and helps implement powerful ideas to accelerate finance for clean energy, climate, sustainability and green growth. FiRe singles out ideas that have the potential for incremental finance of at least $1bn in clean energy in the first three years of implementation, that are achievable within 1-3 years. Hannon Armstrong's 2015 issuance of Sustainable Yield Bonds secured by a portion of its utility scale solar and wind real estate related assets was the first investment to be certified under the CarbonCount methodology, receiving a CarbonCount score of 0.39 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> offset per $1000 of investment. In 2016, Deutsche Bank received a CarbonCount score of 0.18 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> offset per $1000 of investment in a portfolio of rooftop solar PV systems.</p>
