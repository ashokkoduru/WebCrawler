<p>According to <i><a href="/wiki/Landn%C3%A1mab%C3%B3k" title="Landnámabók">Landnámabók</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Settlement_of_Iceland" title="Settlement of Iceland">settlement of Iceland</a> began in the year 874 CE when the <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> chieftain <a href="/wiki/Ing%C3%B3lfr_Arnarson" title="Ingólfr Arnarson">Ingólfr Arnarson</a> became the first permanent settler on the island. In the following centuries, <a href="/wiki/Norwegians" title="Norwegians">Norwegians</a>, and to a lesser extent other <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavians</a>, immigrated to Iceland, bringing with them <a href="/wiki/Thrall" title="Thrall">thralls</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gaels" title="Gaels">Gaelic</a> origin. The island was governed as an <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_Commonwealth" title="Icelandic Commonwealth">independent commonwealth</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Althing" title="Althing">Althing</a>, one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Age_of_Sturlungs" title="Age of Sturlungs">period of civil strife</a>, Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. In 1814, it came under the rule of <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, during which a distinct Icelandic national identity emerged. This culminated in <a href="/wiki/Danish%E2%80%93Icelandic_Act_of_Union" title="Danish–Icelandic Act of Union">independence in 1918</a> and the founding of a <a href="/wiki/Founding_of_the_Republic_of_Iceland" title="Founding of the Republic of Iceland">republic in 1944</a>. Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture, and was among the poorest in Europe. Industrialisation of the fisheries and <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Plan" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> aid following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> brought prosperity, and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Area" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a>, which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Iceland has a <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market economy</a> with relatively low taxes compared to other <a href="/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</a> countries.

Recent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archaeological" title="Archaeological">archaeological</a> excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in <a href="/wiki/Hafnir" title="Hafnir">Hafnir</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Reykjanes" title="Reykjanes">Reykjanes peninsula</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dating" title="Carbon dating">Carbon dating</a> indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880. In 2016, archeologists uncovered a <a href="/wiki/Longhouse" title="Longhouse">longhouse</a> in <a href="/wiki/St%C3%B6%C3%B0varfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur" title="Stöðvarfjörður">Stöðvarfjörður</a> that has been dated to as early as the year 800.</p>
<p>Swedish Viking explorer <a href="/wiki/Gar%C3%B0ar_Svavarsson" title="Garðar Svavarsson">Garðar Svavarsson</a> was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island. He stayed over winter and built a house in <a href="/wiki/H%C3%BAsav%C3%ADk" title="Húsavík">Húsavík</a>. Garðar departed the following summer but one of his men, <a href="/wiki/N%C3%A1ttfari" title="Náttfari">Náttfari</a>, decided to stay behind with two slaves. Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of Iceland.</p>
<p>The Norwegian-Norse chieftain <a href="/wiki/Ing%C3%B3lfr_Arnarson" title="Ingólfr Arnarson">Ingólfr Arnarson</a> built his homestead in present-day <a href="/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk" title="Reykjavík">Reykjavík</a> in the year 874. Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers, largely Scandinavians and their <a href="/wiki/Thrall" title="Thrall">thralls</a>, many of whom were Irish or Scottish. By 930, most <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">arable land</a> on the island had been claimed; the <a href="/wiki/Althing" title="Althing">Althing</a>, a legislative and judicial assembly, was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth. Lack of arable land also served impetus to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norse_colonization_of_Greenland" title="Norse colonization of Greenland">settlement of Greenland</a> starting in 986. The period of these early settlements coincided with the <a href="/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period" title="Medieval Warm Period">Medieval Warm Period</a>, when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century. At this time, about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest, compared to 1% in the present day. Christianity was adopted <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christianisation_of_Iceland" title="Christianisation of Iceland">by consensus</a> around 999–1000, although <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norse_paganism" title="Norse paganism">Norse paganism</a> persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwards.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_Commonwealth" title="Icelandic Commonwealth">Icelandic Commonwealth</a> lasted until the 13th century, when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains. The internal struggles and civil strife of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_the_Sturlungs" title="Age of the Sturlungs">Age of the Sturlungs</a> led to the signing of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Covenant_(Iceland)" title="Old Covenant (Iceland)">Old Covenant</a> in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Norwegian_Empire" title="Norwegian Empire">Norwegian Empire</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Kalmar_Union" title="Kalmar Union">Kalmar Union</a> in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark and <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> were united.

<p>In the ensuing centuries, Iceland became one of the poorest countries in Europe. Infertile soil, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture. The <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495.

The country subsequently became officially Lutheran and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.</p>

<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed <a href="/wiki/Danish%E2%80%93Icelandic_Trade_Monopoly" title="Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly">harsh trade restrictions</a> on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruption and disease, contributed to a decreasing population. Pirates from several countries, including the Barbary Coast, raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery. A great <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population. In 1783 the <a href="/wiki/Laki" title="Laki">Laki</a> volcano erupted, with devastating effects. In the years following the eruption, known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mist_Hardships" title="Mist Hardships">Mist Hardships</a> (Icelandic: <i>Móðuharðindin</i>), over half of all livestock died in the country.

<p>In 1814, following the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Kiel" title="Treaty of Kiel">Treaty of Kiel</a> but Iceland remained a Danish dependency.

<p>Iceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The main island is entirely south of the <a href="/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, which passes through the small Icelandic island of <a href="/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmsey" title="Grímsey">Grímsey</a> off the main island's northern coast. The country lies between latitudes <a href="/wiki/63rd_parallel_north" title="63rd parallel north">63°</a> and <a href="/wiki/68th_parallel_north" title="68th parallel north">68° N</a>, and longitudes <a href="/wiki/25th_meridian_west" title="25th meridian west">25°</a> and <a href="/wiki/13th_meridian_west" title="13th meridian west">13° W</a>.</p>
<p>Iceland is closer to <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a> than to mainland North America; thus, the island is generally included in Europe for historical, political, cultural, and practical reasons. Geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates. The closest body of land is <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> (290 km, 180 mi). The closest bodies of land in Europe are the <a href="/wiki/Faroe_Islands" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a> (420 km, 260 mi); <a href="/wiki/Jan_Mayen" title="Jan Mayen">Jan Mayen</a> Island (570 km, 350 mi); <a href="/wiki/Shetland" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>, both about 740 km (460 mi); and the Scottish mainland and <a href="/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>, both about 750 km (470 mi). The mainland of Norway is about 970 km (600 mi) away.</p>

<p>Iceland is the <a href="/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area" title="List of islands by area">world's 18th largest island</a>, and Europe's second largest island after Great Britain. The main island is 101,826 km (39,315 sq mi), but the entire country is 103,000 km (39,768.5 sq mi) in size, of which 62.7% is <a href="/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>. There are thirty minor islands in Iceland, including the lightly populated Grímsey and the <a href="/wiki/Vestmannaeyjar" title="Vestmannaeyjar">Vestmannaeyjar</a> archipelago. Lakes and glaciers cover 14.3% of its surface; only 23% is vegetated. The largest lakes are <a href="/wiki/%C3%9E%C3%B3risvatn" title="Þórisvatn">Þórisvatn</a> reservoir: 83–88 km (32–34 sq mi) and <a href="/wiki/%C3%9Eingvallavatn" title="Þingvallavatn">Þingvallavatn</a>: 82 km (32 sq mi); other important lakes include <a href="/wiki/Lagarflj%C3%B3t" title="Lagarfljót">Lagarfljót</a> and <a href="/wiki/M%C3%BDvatn" title="Mývatn">Mývatn</a>. <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n" title="Jökulsárlón">Jökulsárlón</a> is the deepest lake, at 248 m (814 ft).</p>
<p>Geologically, Iceland is part of the <a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" title="Mid-Atlantic Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, a ridge along which the <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_crust" title="Oceanic crust">oceanic crust</a> spreads and forms new oceanic crust. This part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume, causing Iceland to be <a href="/wiki/Subaerial" title="Subaerial">subaerial</a> (above the surface of the sea). The ridge marks the boundary between the <a href="/wiki/Eurasian_Plate" title="Eurasian Plate">Eurasian</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_American_Plate" title="North American Plate">North American Plates</a>, and Iceland was created by <a href="/wiki/Rift" title="Rift">rifting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Accretion_(geology)" title="Accretion (geology)">accretion</a> through volcanism along the ridge.</p>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Fjord" title="Fjord">fjords</a> punctuate Iceland's 4,970-kilometre (3,088-mile) long coastline, which is also where most settlements are situated. The island's interior, the <a href="/wiki/Highlands_of_Iceland" title="Highlands of Iceland">Highlands of Iceland</a>, is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand, mountains and <a href="/wiki/Lava_field" title="Lava field">lava fields</a>.

<p>A geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the <a href="/wiki/Iceland_hotspot" title="Iceland hotspot">Iceland hotspot</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" title="Mid-Atlantic Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes, notably <a href="/wiki/Hekla" title="Hekla">Hekla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eldgj%C3%A1" title="Eldgjá">Eldgjá</a>, <a href="/wiki/Her%C3%B0ubrei%C3%B0" title="Herðubreið">Herðubreið</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eldfell" title="Eldfell">Eldfell</a>. The volcanic eruption of <a href="/wiki/Laki" title="Laki">Laki</a> in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population. In addition, the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterward, and affected climates in other areas.</p>
<p>Iceland has many <a href="/wiki/Geyser" title="Geyser">geysers</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Geysir" title="Geysir">Geysir</a>, from which the English word is derived, and the famous <a href="/wiki/Strokkur" title="Strokkur">Strokkur</a>, which erupts every 8–10 minutes. After a phase of inactivity, Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000. Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often.</p>
<p>With the widespread availability of <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a>, and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating and electricity. The island is composed primarily of <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basalt</a>, a low-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silica" title="Silica">silica</a> <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a> associated with <a href="/wiki/Effusive_eruption" title="Effusive eruption">effusive volcanism</a> as has occurred also in <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as <a href="/wiki/Rhyolite" title="Rhyolite">rhyolite</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andesite" title="Andesite">andesite</a>. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approx. 30 volcanic systems active.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Surtsey" title="Surtsey">Surtsey</a>, one of the youngest islands in the world, is part of Iceland. Named after <a href="/wiki/Surtr" title="Surtr">Surtr</a>, it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 November 1963 and 5 June 1968. Only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island.</p>
<p>On 21 March 2010, a <a href="/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull" title="2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull">volcano in Eyjafjallajökull</a> in the south of Iceland erupted for the first time since 1821, forcing 600 people to flee their homes. Additional eruptions on 14 April forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes. The resultant cloud of <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">volcanic ash</a> brought <a href="/wiki/Air_travel_disruption_after_the_2010_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull_eruption" title="Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption">major disruption to air travel</a> across Europe.</p>
<p>Another large eruption occurred on 21 May 2011. This time it was the <a href="/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmsv%C3%B6tn" title="Grímsvötn">Grímsvötn</a> volcano, located under the thick ice of Europe's largest glacier, <a href="/wiki/Vatnaj%C3%B6kull" title="Vatnajökull">Vatnajökull</a>. Grímsvötn is one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull activity, with ash and lava 20 km (12 mi) hurled into the atmosphere creating a large cloud.</p>
<p>The highest elevation for Iceland is listed as 2,110 metres (6,923 ft) at Hvannadalshnúkur (64°00′N 16°39′W).</p>

<p>The climate of Iceland's coast is subpolar <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_climate" title="Oceanic climate">oceanic</a>. The warm <a href="/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current" title="North Atlantic Current">North Atlantic Current</a> ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world.

Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter. Ice incursions are rare, the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969.</p>
<p>The climate varies between different parts of the island. Generally speaking, the south coast is warmer, wetter and windier than the north. The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country. Low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid. Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south.</p>
<p>The highest air temperature recorded was 30.5 °C (86.9 °F) on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast. The lowest was −38 °C (−36.4 °F) on 22 January 1918 at Grímsstaðir and Möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland. The temperature records for Reykjavík are 26.2 °C (79.2 °F) on 30 July 2008, and −24.5 °C (−12.1 °F) on 21 January 1918.</p>

<p>There are around 1,300 known species of insects in Iceland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The only native land mammal when humans arrived was the <a href="/wiki/Arctic_fox" title="Arctic fox">Arctic fox</a>, which came to the island at the end of the ice age, walking over the frozen sea. On rare occasions, bats have been carried to the island with the winds, but they are not able to breed there. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polar_bears" title="Polar bears">Polar bears</a> occasionally come over from <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, but they are just visitors, and no Icelandic populations exist. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Phytogeography" title="Phytogeography">Phytogeographically</a>, Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the <a href="/wiki/Circumboreal_Region" title="Circumboreal Region">Circumboreal Region</a> within the <a href="/wiki/Boreal_Kingdom" title="Boreal Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a>. Approximately three quarters of the island are barren of vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (<i><a href="/wiki/Betula_pubescens" title="Betula pubescens">Betula pubescens</a></i>), which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland, along with aspens (<i><a href="/wiki/Populus_tremula" title="Populus tremula">Populus tremula</a></i>), rowans (<i><a href="/wiki/Sorbus_aucuparia" title="Sorbus aucuparia">Sorbus aucuparia</a></i>), common junipers (<i><a href="/wiki/Juniperus_communis" title="Juniperus communis">Juniperus communis</a></i>) and other smaller trees, mainly willows.</p>
<p>When the island was first settled, it was extensively forested. In the late 12th century, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ari_the_Wise" title="Ari the Wise">Ari the Wise</a> described it in the <a href="/wiki/%C3%8Dslendingab%C3%B3k" title="Íslendingabók">Íslendingabók</a> as "forested from mountain to sea shore". Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin, volcanic soils and limited <a href="/wiki/Species_richness" title="Species richness">species diversity</a>. The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber. <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">Deforestation</a>, climatic deterioration during the <a href="/wiki/Little_Ice_Age" title="Little Ice Age">Little Ice Age</a> and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a>. Today, many farms have been abandoned. Three quarters of Iceland's 100,000 square kilometres are affected by soil erosion 18,000 km (6,900 sq mi) serious enough to make the land useless. Only a few small <a href="/wiki/Birch" title="Birch">birch</a> stands now exist in isolated reserves. The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees, but the result does not compare to the original forests. Some of the planted forests include <a href="/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduced species</a>. The tallest tree in Iceland is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sitka_spruce" title="Sitka spruce">sitka spruce</a> planted in 1949 in <a href="/wiki/Kirkjub%C3%A6jarklaustur" title="Kirkjubæjarklaustur">Kirkjubæjarklaustur</a>; it was measured at 25.2 metres (83 ft) in 2013.</p>

Other political parties with seats in the Althing are the centre-left <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_Alliance" title="Social Democratic Alliance">Social Democratic Alliance</a> (<i>Samfylkingin</i>), <a href="/wiki/Left-Green_Movement" title="Left-Green Movement">Left-Green Movement</a> (<i>Vinstrihreyfingin – grænt framboð</i>), <a href="/wiki/Bright_Future_(Iceland)" title="Bright Future (Iceland)">Bright Future</a> (<i>Björt framtíð</i>), and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirate_Party_Iceland" title="Pirate Party Iceland">Pirate Party of Iceland</a> (<i>Píratar</i>). Many other parties exist on the municipal level, most of which run only locally in a single municipality.</p>
<p>Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women. Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (<i>Kvennalistinn</i>), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women. After participating in its first parliamentary elections, the Women's List helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15%. Although it disbanded in 1999, merging with the Social Democratic Alliance, it left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women, and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female, compared to the global average of 16%.</p>
<p>In 2011 Iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions and 13th in government transparency. The country has a high level of civic participation, with 81.4% voter turnout during the most recent elections, compared to an OECD average of 72%. However, only 50% of Icelanders say they trust their political institutions, slightly less than the OECD average of 56% (and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Icelandic_financial_crisis" title="Icelandic financial crisis">Icelandic financial crisis</a>).</p>

<p>Iceland is a <a href="/wiki/Representative_democracy" title="Representative democracy">representative democracy</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_republic" title="Parliamentary republic">parliamentary republic</a>. The modern parliament, <i>Alþingi</i> (English: <a href="/wiki/Althing" title="Althing">Althing</a>), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_Commonwealth" title="Icelandic Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a> period and suspended in 1799. Consequently, "it is arguably the world's oldest <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary democracy</a>." It currently has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years. The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit. The elections for president, the Althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/President_of_Iceland" title="President of Iceland">president of Iceland</a> is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat, but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum. The current president is <a href="/wiki/Gu%C3%B0ni_Th._J%C3%B3hannesson" title="Guðni Th. Jóhannesson">Guðni Th. Jóhannesson</a>. The head of government is the prime minister who, together with the <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_of_Iceland" title="Cabinet of Iceland">cabinet</a>, is responsible for <a href="/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="Executive (government)">executive</a> government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent <a href="/wiki/Sveinn_Bj%C3%B6rnsson" title="Sveinn Björnsson">Sveinn Björnsson</a>, who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.</p>
<p>The governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected <a href="/wiki/Vigd%C3%ADs_Finnbogad%C3%B3ttir" title="Vigdís Finnbogadóttir">Vigdís Finnbogadóttir</a> as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Iceland" title="Administrative divisions of Iceland">Administrative divisions of Iceland</a></div>
<p>Iceland is divided into regions, constituencies and municipalities. The eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes. District court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division. Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:</p>

<p>The redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country, since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Iceland" title="Economy of Iceland">Economy of Iceland</a></div>
<p>In 2007, Iceland was the <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)" title="List of countries by GDP (nominal)">seventh most productive country in the world per capita</a> (US$54,858), and the fifth most productive by <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita" title="List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita">GDP</a> at <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a> ($40,112). About 85 percent of total <a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a> supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources. Utilization of abundant <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a> has made Iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita. As a result of its commitment to renewable energy, the 2016 Global Green Economy Index ranked Iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world. Historically, Iceland's economy depended heavily on fishing, which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% of the work force. The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, aluminium, and <a href="/wiki/Ferrosilicon" title="Ferrosilicon">ferrosilicon</a>. <a href="/wiki/Whaling_in_Iceland" title="Whaling in Iceland">Whaling in Iceland</a> has been historically significant. Iceland still relies heavily on fishing, but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006.</p>
<p>Until the 20th century, Iceland was among the poorest countries in Europe. Currently, it remains one of the most developed countries in the world. Strong economic growth had led Iceland to be ranked <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index" title="List of countries by Human Development Index">first</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>' <a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a> report for 2007/2008, although in 2011 its HDI rating had fallen to 14th place as a result of the economic crisis. Nevertheless, according to the Economist Intelligence Index of 2011, Iceland has the 2nd highest quality of life in the world. Based on the <a href="/wiki/Gini_coefficient" title="Gini coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>, Iceland also has one of the lowest rates of income inequality in the world, and when <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI" title="List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI">adjusted for inequality</a>, its HDI ranking climbs to 5th place. Iceland's unemployment rate has declined consistently since the crisis, with 4.8% of the labour force being unemployed as of June 2012, compared to 6% in 2011 and 8.1% in 2010.</p>
<p>Many political parties remain opposed to EU membership, primarily due to Icelanders' concern about losing control over their natural resources (particularly fisheries). The national currency of Iceland is the <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_kr%C3%B3na" title="Icelandic króna">Icelandic króna</a> (ISK). Nearly 70% of Icelanders have favoured the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_dollar" title="Canadian dollar">Canadian dollar</a> (CAD) – more than any other currency in the world.</p>
<p>A poll released on 5 March 2010 by Capacent Gallup showed that 31% of respondents were in favour of adopting the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> and 69% opposed. Another Capacent Gallup poll conducted in February 2012 found that 67.4% of Icelanders would reject EU membership in a referendum.</p>

<p>Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, including software production, <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, and finance; industry accounts for around a quarter of economic activity, while services comprise close to 70%. The tourism sector is expanding, especially in <a href="/wiki/Ecotourism" title="Ecotourism">ecotourism</a> and whale-watching. On average, Iceland receives around 1.1 million visitors annually, which is more than three times the native population. Iceland's agriculture industry, accounting for 5.4% of GDP, consists mainly of potatoes, green vegetables (in <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse" title="Greenhouse">greenhouses</a>), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mutton" title="Mutton">mutton</a> and dairy products. The financial centre is <a href="/wiki/Borgart%C3%BAn" title="Borgartún">Borgartún</a> in Reykjavík, which hosts a large number of companies and three investment banks. Iceland's <a href="/wiki/Stock_market" title="Stock market">stock market</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Iceland_Stock_Exchange" title="Iceland Stock Exchange">Iceland Stock Exchange</a> (ISE), was established in 1985.</p>
<p>Iceland is ranked 27th in the 2012 <a href="/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom" title="Index of Economic Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a>, lower than in prior years but still among the freest in the world. As of 2016, it ranks 29th in the <a href="/wiki/World_Economic_Forum" title="World Economic Forum">World Economic Forum</a>'s Global Competitive Index, one place lower than in 2015. According to <a href="/wiki/INSEAD" title="INSEAD">INSEAD</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index_(Cornell_University,_INSEAD_and_WIPO)" title="Global Innovation Index (Cornell University, INSEAD and WIPO)">Global Innovation Index</a>, Iceland is the 11th most innovative country in the world. Unlike most Western European countries, Iceland has a <a href="/wiki/Flat_tax" title="Flat tax">flat tax</a> system: the main personal income tax rate is a flat 22.75%, and combined with municipal taxes, the total tax rate equals no more than 35.7%, not including the many deductions that are available. The <a href="/wiki/Corporate_tax" title="Corporate tax">corporate tax</a> rate is a flat 18%, one of the lowest in the world. There is also a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Value_added_tax" title="Value added tax">value added tax</a>, whereas a net <a href="/wiki/Wealth_tax" title="Wealth tax">wealth tax</a> was eliminated in 2006.

Property rights are strong and Iceland is one of the few countries where they are applied to <a href="/wiki/Fisheries_management" title="Fisheries management">fishery management</a>. Like other <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare states</a>, taxpayers pay various subsidies to each other, but with spending being less than in most European countries.</p>
<p>Despite low tax rates, agricultural assistance is the highest among OECD countries and a potential impediment to structural change. Also, health care and education spending have relatively poor returns by OECD measures, though improvements have been made in both areas. The OECD <i>Economic Survey of Iceland 2008</i> had highlighted Iceland's challenges in currency and macroeconomic policy. There was a <a href="/wiki/Currency_crisis" title="Currency crisis">currency crisis</a> that started in the spring of 2008, and on 6 October trading in Iceland's banks was suspended as the government battled to save the economy. The latest assessment by the OECD determined that Iceland has made progress in many areas, particularly in creating a sustainable fiscal policy and restoring the health of the financial sector; however, challenges remain in making the fishing industry more efficient and sustainable, as well as in improving monetary policy to address inflation. Iceland's public debt has decreased since the economic crisis, and as of 2015 is the 31th highest in the world by proportion of national GDP.</p>

<p>Iceland had been hit especially hard by the <a href="/wiki/Great_Recession" title="Great Recession">Great Recession</a> that began in December 2007, because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, <a href="/wiki/Glitnir_(bank)" title="Glitnir (bank)">Glitnir</a>, <a href="/wiki/Landsbanki" title="Landsbanki">Landsbanki</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kaupthing" title="Kaupthing">Kaupthing</a>, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14 billion ($19 billion). In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. Icelandic officials, including central bank governor <a href="/wiki/Dav%C3%AD%C3%B0_Oddsson" title="Davíð Oddsson">Davíð Oddsson</a>, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>On 28 October 2008, the Icelandic government raised interest rates to 18% (as of August 2010, it was 7%), a move forced in part by the terms of acquiring a loan from <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF). After the rate hike, trading on the Icelandic króna finally resumed on the open market, with valuation at around 250 ISK per Euro, less than one-third the value of the 1:70 exchange rate during most of 2008, and a significant drop from the 1:150 exchange ratio of the week before. On 20 November 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Nordic_countries" title="Nordic countries">Nordic countries</a> agreed to lend Iceland $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>On 26 January 2009, the coalition government collapsed due to the public dissent over the handling of the financial crisis. A new left-wing government was formed a week later and immediately set about removing Central Bank governor Davíð Oddsson and his aides from the bank through changes in law. Davíð was removed on 26 February 2009 in the wake of protests outside the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Thousands of <a href="/wiki/Icelanders" title="Icelanders">Icelanders</a> have moved from the country after the collapse, and many of those moved to <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>. In 2005, 293 people moved from Iceland to <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>; in 2009, the figure was 1,625. In April 2010, the Icelandic Parliament‘s Special Investigation Commission published the findings of its investigation, revealing the extent of control fraud in this crisis. By June 2012, Landsbanki managed to repay about half of the <a href="/wiki/Icesave_dispute" title="Icesave dispute">Icesave</a> debt.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P." title="Bloomberg L.P.">Bloomberg</a>, Iceland is on the trajectory of 2% unemployment as a result of crisis-management decisions made back in 2008, including allowing the banks to fail.</p>

Iceland has 13,034 km (8,099 mi) of administered roads, of which 4,617 km (2,869 mi) are paved and 8,338 km (5,181 mi) are not. A great number of roads remain unpaved, mostly little-used rural roads. The road speed limits are 50 km/h (31 mph) in towns, 80 km/h (50 mph) on gravel country roads and 90 km/h (56 mph) on hard-surfaced roads. Iceland currently has no railways.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland)" title="Route 1 (Iceland)">Route 1</a>, or the Ring Road (Icelandic: <i>Þjóðvegur 1</i> or <i>Hringvegur</i>), was completed in 1974, and is a main road that runs around Iceland and connects all the inhabited parts of the island, with the interior of the island being uninhabited. This paved road is 1,332 km (828 mi) long with one lane in each direction, except near larger towns and cities and in the <a href="/wiki/Hvalfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur_Tunnel" title="Hvalfjörður Tunnel">Hvalfjörður Tunnel</a> (also the site of a toll) where it has more lanes.

Such a cable would give Iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in Iceland. Iceland has considerable renewable energy resources, especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources, and most of the potential has not been developed, partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of Iceland, but the United Kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy, and this could lead to further development of the energy resources.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Education,_Science_and_Culture_(Iceland)" title="Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)">Ministry of Education, Science and Culture</a> is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities. The government does allow citizens to <a href="/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling">Home educate</a> their children, however under a very strict set of demands. Students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.</p>
<p>Nursery school, or <i>leikskóli</i>, is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years, and is the first step in the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible.</p>

<p>Compulsory education, or <i>grunnskóli</i>, comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often is conducted at the same institution. Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16 years. The school year lasts nine months, beginning between 21 August and 1 September, ending between 31 May and 10 June. The minimum number of school days was once 170, but after a new teachers' wage contract, it increased to 180. Lessons take place five days a week. All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity, although an exemption may be considered by the <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Education,_Science_and_Culture_(Iceland)" title="Minister of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)">Minister of Education</a>.</p>
<p>Upper secondary education, or <i>framhaldsskóli</i>, follows lower secondary education. These schools are also known as <a href="/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)" title="Gymnasium (school)">gymnasia</a> in English. Though not compulsory, everyone who has had a compulsory education has the right to upper secondary education. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996. All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools. The largest seat of higher education is the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Iceland" title="University of Iceland">University of Iceland</a>, which has its main campus in central Reykjavík.

<p>An OECD assessment found 64% of Icelanders aged 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, which is lower than the OECD average of 73%. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, only 69% have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, significantly lower than the OECD average of 80%. Nevertheless, Iceland's education system is considered excellent: the <a href="/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment" title="Programme for International Student Assessment">Programme for International Student Assessment</a> currently ranks it as the 16th best performing, above the OECD average.

<p>Iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the <a href="/wiki/Settlement_of_Iceland" title="Settlement of Iceland">Age of Settlement</a>. The biopharmaceutical company <a href="/wiki/DeCODE_genetics" title="DeCODE genetics">deCODE genetics</a> has funded the creation of a <a href="/wiki/Genealogy" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a> database that is intended to cover all of Iceland's known inhabitants. It views the database, called <i><a href="/wiki/%C3%8Dslendingab%C3%B3k_(genealogical_database)" title="Íslendingabók (genealogical database)">Íslendingabók</a></i>, as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases, given the relative isolation of Iceland's population.</p>
<p>The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and <a href="/wiki/Bubonic_plague" title="Bubonic plague">bubonic plagues</a> adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a> years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the <a href="/wiki/Laki" title="Laki">Laki volcano</a> during 1783–1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century—from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Replacement_fertility_rate" title="Replacement fertility rate">sufficient for long-term population growth</a> (see table on the left).</p>

<p>In December 2007, 33,678 people (13.5% of the total population) living in Iceland had been born abroad, including children of Icelandic parents living abroad. Around 19,000 people (6% of the population) held foreign citizenship. <a href="/wiki/Polish_diaspora" title="Polish diaspora">Polish</a> people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin, and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce. About 8,000 Poles now live in Iceland, 1,500 of them in <a href="/wiki/Fjar%C3%B0abygg%C3%B0" title="Fjarðabyggð">Fjarðabyggð</a> where they make up 75% of the workforce who are constructing the Fjarðarál aluminium plant. The recent increase in <a href="/wiki/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a> has been credited to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labour_shortage" title="Labour shortage">labour shortage</a> due to the booming economy at the time, as well as to the lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the <a href="/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="2004 enlargement of the European Union">2004 enlargement of the European Union</a>. Large-scale construction projects in the east of Iceland (see <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A1rahnj%C3%BAkar_Hydropower_Plant" title="Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant">Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant</a>) have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary. Many Polish immigrants were also considering leaving in 2008 as a result of the <a href="/wiki/2008%E2%80%932011_Icelandic_financial_crisis" title="2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis">Icelandic financial crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The southwest corner of Iceland is the most densely populated region. It is also the location of the capital Reykjavík, the northernmost national capital in the world. The largest towns outside the Greater Reykjavík area are <a href="/wiki/Akureyri" title="Akureyri">Akureyri</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reykjanesb%C3%A6r" title="Reykjanesbær">Reykjanesbær</a>, although the latter is relatively close to the capital.</p>
<p>Some 500 Icelanders under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Erik_the_Red" title="Erik the Red">Erik the Red</a> colonised <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> among the existing <a href="/wiki/Greenland#Early_Paleo-Eskimo_cultures" title="Greenland">paleo-Eskimo inhabitants</a> in the late 10th century. The total population reached a high point of perhaps 5,000 and developed independent institutions before disappearing by 1500. People from Greenland attempted to set up a colony at <a href="/wiki/Vinland" title="Vinland">Vinland</a> in North America, but it was abandoned in the face of hostility from the indigenous residents. Emigration to the United States and Canada began in the 1870s. As of 2006, Canada had over 88,000 people of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Icelandic_Canadian" title="Icelandic Canadian">Icelandic</a> descent, while there are more than 40,000 Americans of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Icelandic_American" title="Icelandic American">Icelandic</a> descent, according to the 2000 US census.</p>

The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation.

<p><a href="/wiki/Icelandic_Sign_Language" title="Icelandic Sign Language">Icelandic Sign Language</a> was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011. In education, its use for Iceland's deaf community is <a href="/wiki/Legal_recognition_of_sign_languages" title="Legal recognition of sign languages">regulated</a> by the <i>National Curriculum Guide</i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="/wiki/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a> are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum.

<p>Rather than using family names, as is the usual custom in most western nations, Icelanders carry <a href="/wiki/Patronymic" title="Patronymic">patronymic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Matronymic" title="Matronymic">matronymic</a> surnames, patronyms being far more commonly practiced. Patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father, while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother. These follow the person's given name, e.g. <i>Elísabet Jónsdóttir</i> ("Elísabet, Jón's daughter" (Jón, being the father)) or <i>Ólafur Katrínarson</i> ("Ólafur, Katrín's son" (Katrín being the mother)). Consequently, Icelanders refer to one another by their given name, and the Icelandic telephone directory is listed alphabetically by first name rather than by surname. All new names must be decided upon by the <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_Naming_Committee" title="Icelandic Naming Committee">Icelandic Naming Committee</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Iceland has a <a href="/wiki/Universal_health_care" title="Universal health care">universal health care</a> system that is administered by its Ministry of Welfare (<a href="/wiki/Icelandic_language" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic</a>: <span lang="is"><i>Velferðarráðuneytið</i></span>) and paid for mostly by taxes (85%) and to a lesser extent by service fees (15%). Unlike most countries, there are no private hospitals, and private insurance is practically nonexistent.</p>
<p>A considerable portion of the government budget is assigned to health care, and Iceland ranks 11th in health care expenditures as a percentage of GDP and 14th in spending per capita. Over all, the country's health care system is one of the best performing in the world, ranked 15th by the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>. According to an OECD report, Iceland devotes far more resources to healthcare than most industrialised nations. As of 2009, Iceland had 3.7 doctors per 1,000 people (compared with an average of 3.1 in OECD countries) and 15.3 nurses per 1,000 people (compared with an OECD average of 8.4).</p>
<p>Icelanders are among the world's healthiest people, with 81% reporting they are in good health, according to an OECD survey. Although it is a growing problem, <a href="/wiki/Obesity" title="Obesity">obesity</a> is not as prevalent as in other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developed_countries" title="Developed countries">developed countries</a>,. Iceland has many campaigns for health and wellbeing. Most famously, the television show <a href="/wiki/LazyTown" title="LazyTown">Lazytown</a>, starring and created by former gymnastics champion <a href="/wiki/Magn%C3%BAs_Scheving" title="Magnús Scheving">Magnus Scheving</a>. <a href="/wiki/Infant_mortality" title="Infant mortality">Infant mortality</a> is one of the lowest in the world, and the proportion of the population that smokes is lower than the OECD average. Almost all women choose to terminate pregnancies of children with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Down_Syndrome" title="Down Syndrome">Down Syndrome</a> in Iceland.  The average <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> is 81.8 (compared to an OECD average of 79.5), the 4th highest in the world.</p>
<p>Additionally, Iceland has a very low level of pollution, thanks to an overwhelming reliance on cleaner geothermal energy, a low population density, and a high level of environmental consciousness among <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Citizens" title="Citizens">citizens</a>. According to an OECD assessment, the amount of toxic material in the atmosphere is far lower than any other industrialised country measured.</p>

<p>The Registers Iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every Icelandic citizen. In 2015, Icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>71.6% members of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Iceland" title="Church of Iceland">Church of Iceland</a>.</li>
<li>11.6% members of some other <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a> denomination.</li>
<li>9.0% other and not specified</li>
<li>5.8% unaffiliated</li>
<li>1.7% members of non-<a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a> denomination.</li>
<li>0.4% members of the <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_Ethical_Humanist_Association" title="Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association">Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Iceland is a very <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secular" title="Secular">secular</a> country: as with other Nordic nations, religious attendance is relatively low. The above statistics represent administrative membership of religious organisations, which does not necessarily reflect the belief demographics of the population of Iceland. According to a study published in 2001, 23% of the inhabitants were either <a href="/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheist</a> or <a href="/wiki/Agnosticism" title="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>. A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 57% of Icelanders considered themselves "a religious person", 31% considered themselves "a non religious person", while 10% defined themselves as "a convinced atheist", placing Iceland among the ten countries with the highest proportions of atheists in the world.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Iceland" title="Culture of Iceland">Culture of Iceland</a></div>
<p>Icelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions. <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_literature" title="Icelandic literature">Icelandic literature</a> is popular, in particular the <a href="/wiki/Sagas_of_Icelanders" title="Sagas of Icelanders">sagas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edda" title="Edda">eddas</a> that were written during the <a href="/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High</a> and <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>. Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_language" title="Icelandic language">Icelandic language</a>, which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Nordic languages.</p>
<p>In contrast to other Nordic countries, Icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency; in a public opinion analysis conducted by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, over 85% of Icelanders believe independence is "very important," compared to 47% of Norwegians, 49% of Danes, and an average of 53% for the EU25. Icelanders also have a very strong work ethic, working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation.</p>
<p>According to a poll conducted by the OECD, 66% of Icelanders were satisfied with their lives, while 70% believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future. Similarly, 83% of people in Iceland reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones, compared to an OECD average of 72%, which makes Iceland one of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Happiest_country" title="Happiest country">happiest countries</a> in the OECD. A more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives, compared to a global average of about 53%.</p>
<p>Iceland is liberal with regard to <a href="/wiki/LGBT" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> rights issues. In 1996, the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Registered_partnership" title="Registered partnership">registered partnerships</a> for same-sex couples, conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage. In 2006, parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment. On 11 June 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Iceland" title="Same-sex marriage in Iceland">Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law</a>, making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals, making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a>. The law took effect on 27 June 2010. The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible, and marriage is their only option—identical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples.</p>
<p>Icelanders are known for their deep sense of community: an OECD survey found that 98% believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need, higher than in any other industrialised country. Similarly, only 6% reported "rarely" or "never" socializing with others. This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population, as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment, which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">Egalitarianism</a> is highly valued among the people of Iceland, with income inequality being among the lowest in the world. The constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges, titles, and ranks. Everyone is addressed by their first name. As in other Nordic countries, equality between the sexes is very high; Iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in.</p>

<p>Iceland's best-known classical works of literature are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Icelanders%27_sagas" title="Icelanders' sagas">Icelanders' sagas</a>, prose epics set in Iceland's age of settlement. The most famous of these include <i><a href="/wiki/Nj%C3%A1ls_saga" title="Njáls saga">Njáls saga</a></i>, about an epic blood feud, and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gr%C3%A6nlendinga_saga" title="Grænlendinga saga">Grænlendinga saga</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Saga_of_Erik_the_Red" title="Saga of Erik the Red">Eiríks saga</a></i>, describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland</a>). <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Egils_saga" title="Egils saga">Egils saga</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Laxd%C3%A6la_saga" title="Laxdæla saga">Laxdæla saga</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Grettis_saga" title="Grettis saga">Grettis saga</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/G%C3%ADsla_saga" title="Gísla saga">Gísla saga</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Gunnlaugs_saga_ormstungu" title="Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu">Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu</a></i> are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.</p>
<p>A translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the <a href="/wiki/Passion_Hymns" title="Passion Hymns">Passion Hymns</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hallgr%C3%ADmur_P%C3%A9tursson" title="Hallgrímur Pétursson">Hallgrímur Pétursson</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/R%C3%ADmur" title="Rímur">rímur</a></i>, rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, <i>rímur</i> were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, <a href="/wiki/Romantic_nationalism" title="Romantic nationalism">National-Romantic</a> writer <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3nas_Hallgr%C3%ADmsson" title="Jónas Hallgrímsson">Jónas Hallgrímsson</a>. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably <a href="/wiki/Halld%C3%B3r_Laxness" title="Halldór Laxness">Halldór Laxness</a>, who received the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature" title="Nobel Prize in Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). <a href="/wiki/Steinn_Steinarr" title="Steinn Steinarr">Steinn Steinarr</a> was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.</p>
<p>Icelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation. Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines, and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Art">Art</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Icelandic_art" title="Icelandic art">Icelandic art</a></div>
<p>The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for <a href="/wiki/History_of_Iceland#Home_rule_and_sovereignty" title="History of Iceland">home rule and independence</a>, which was very active in the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%C3%9E%C3%B3rarinn_%C3%9Eorl%C3%A1ksson" title="Þórarinn Þorláksson">Þórarinn Þorláksson</a>, who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at <a href="/wiki/Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Fine_Arts" title="Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts">Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts</a> at that time, including <a href="/wiki/%C3%81sgr%C3%ADmur_J%C3%B3nsson" title="Ásgrímur Jónsson">Ásgrímur Jónsson</a>, who together with Þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þórarinn and Ásgrímur. These included <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3hannes_Sveinsson_Kjarval" title="Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval">Jóhannes Kjarval</a> and <a href="/wiki/J%C3%BAl%C3%ADana_Sveinsd%C3%B3ttir" title="Júlíana Sveinsdóttir">Júlíana Sveinsdóttir</a>. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_rock" title="Volcanic rock">volcanic rock</a> that dominates the Icelandic environment. <a href="/wiki/Einar_H%C3%A1konarson" title="Einar Hákonarson">Einar Hákonarson</a> is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.</p>
<p>In the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects. <a href="/wiki/The_Living_Art_Museum" title="The Living Art Museum">The Living Art Museum</a>, Reykjavík Municipal Art Museum, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk_Art_Museum" title="Reykjavík Art Museum">Reykjavík Art Museum</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Iceland" title="National Gallery of Iceland">National Gallery of Iceland</a> are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.</p>

<p>Traditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by <a href="/wiki/Pump_organ" title="Pump organ">harmoniums</a>. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually <a href="/wiki/A_cappella" title="A cappella">a cappella</a>, which can be traced back to <a href="/wiki/Skald" title="Skald">skaldic</a> poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes. The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was <a href="/wiki/Sigur%C3%B0ur_Brei%C3%B0fj%C3%B6r%C3%B0" title="Sigurður Breiðfjörð">Sigurður Breiðfjörð</a> (1798–1846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.</p>
<p>Icelandic contemporary music consists of a big group of bands, ranging from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pop-rock" title="Pop-rock">pop-rock</a> groups such as <a href="/wiki/Bang_Gang" title="Bang Gang">Bang Gang</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quarashi" title="Quarashi">Quarashi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amiina" title="Amiina">Amiina</a> to solo ballad singers like <a href="/wiki/Bubbi_Morthens" title="Bubbi Morthens">Bubbi Morthens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Megas" title="Megas">Megas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rgvin_Halld%C3%B3rsson" title="Björgvin Halldórsson">Björgvin Halldórsson</a>. <a href="/wiki/Independent_music" title="Independent music">Independent music</a> is very strong in Iceland, with bands such as <a href="/wiki/M%C3%BAm" title="Múm">múm</a>, The Sugarcubes, <a href="/wiki/HAM_(band)" title="HAM (band)">HAM</a>, <a href="/wiki/Of_Monsters_and_Men" title="Of Monsters and Men">Of Monsters and Men</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sigur_R%C3%B3s" title="Sigur Rós">Sigur Rós</a>, <a href="/wiki/S%C3%B3ley" title="Sóley">Sóley</a> and Viking metal band <a href="/wiki/Sk%C3%A1lm%C3%B6ld" title="Skálmöld">Skálmöld</a>, as well as solo artists <a href="/wiki/Emil%C3%ADana_Torrini" title="Emilíana Torrini">Emilíana Torrini</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mugison" title="Mugison">Mugison</a>.</p>

Perhaps best known is the jazz fusion band Mezzoforte and Los Angeles-based jazz vocalist <a href="/wiki/Anna_Mj%C3%B6ll" title="Anna Mjöll">Anna Mjöll</a>.
