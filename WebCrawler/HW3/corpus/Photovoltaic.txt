<p>A typical <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_system" title="Photovoltaic system">photovoltaic system</a> employs <a href="/wiki/Solar_panel" title="Solar panel">solar panels</a>, each comprising a number of <a href="/wiki/Solar_cell" title="Solar cell">solar cells</a>, which generate electrical power. The first step is the photoelectric effect followed by an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrochemical" title="Electrochemical">electrochemical</a> process where crystallized atoms, <a href="/wiki/Ionization" title="Ionization">ionized</a> in a series, generate an electric current. PV Installations may be ground-mounted, <a href="/wiki/Rooftop_photovoltaic_power_station" title="Rooftop photovoltaic power station">rooftop</a> mounted or wall mounted.</p>
<p>Solar PV generates no pollution. The direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts. Photovoltaic systems have been used for fifty years in specialized applications, standalone and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grid-connected_PV_system" title="Grid-connected PV system">grid-connected PV systems</a> have been in use for more than twenty years. They were first mass-produced in 2000, when German environmentalists and the <a href="/wiki/Eurosolar" title="Eurosolar">Eurosolar</a> organization got government funding for a ten thousand roof program.</p>
<p>On the other hand, grid-connected PV systems have the major disadvantage that the power output is dependent on direct sunlight, so about 10-25% is lost if a tracking system is not used, since the cell wil not be directly facing the sun at all times.Power output is also adversely affected by weather conditions such as the amount of dust and water vapour in the air or the amount of cloud cover. This means that, in the national grid for example, this power has to be made up by other power sources: hydrocarbon, nuclear, hydroelectric or wind energy.</p>
<p>Advances in technology and increased manufacturing scale have reduced the cost, increased the reliability, and increased the efficiency of photovoltaic instalations and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Levelised_cost_of_electricity" title="Levelised cost of electricity">levelised cost of electricity</a> from PV is competitive, on a kilowatt/ hour basis, with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions.

<p><a href="/wiki/Net_metering" title="Net metering">Net metering</a> and financial incentives, such as preferential <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariffs</a> for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The term "photovoltaic" comes from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> φῶς (<i>phōs</i>) meaning "light", and from "volt", the unit of electro-motive force, the <a href="/wiki/Volt" title="Volt">volt</a>, which in turn comes from the last name of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Italian_people" title="Italian people">Italian</a> physicist <a href="/wiki/Alessandro_Volta" title="Alessandro Volta">Alessandro Volta</a>, inventor of the battery (<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Electro%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84chemical_cell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Electroاللالالchemical cell (page does not exist)">electroاللالالchemical cell</a>). The term "photo-voltaic" has been in use in English since 1849.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Solar_cell" title="Solar cell">Solar cell</a></div>


<p>Photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons. The <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_effect" title="Photovoltaic effect">photovoltaic effect</a> refers to photons of light exciting electrons into a higher state of energy, allowing them to act as charge carriers for an electric current. The photovoltaic effect was first observed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alexandre-Edmond_Becquerel" title="Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel">Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel</a> in 1839. The term photovoltaic denotes the unbiased operating mode of a <a href="/wiki/Photodiode" title="Photodiode">photodiode</a> in which current through the device is entirely due to the transduced light energy. Virtually all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode.</p>
<p>Solar cells produce direct current electricity from sun light which can be used to power equipment or to <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery" title="Rechargeable battery">recharge a battery</a>. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a>, but today the majority of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_module" title="Photovoltaic module">photovoltaic modules</a> are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inverter_(electrical)" title="Inverter (electrical)">inverter</a> is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, <a href="/wiki/Electric_boat" title="Electric boat">boats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Recreational_vehicle" title="Recreational vehicle">recreational vehicles</a>, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, <a href="/wiki/Remote_sensing" title="Remote sensing">remote sensing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cathodic_protection" title="Cathodic protection">cathodic protection</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipelines</a>.</p>
<p>Photovoltaic power generation employs <a href="/wiki/Solar_panel" title="Solar panel">solar panels</a> composed of a number of <a href="/wiki/Solar_cell" title="Solar cell">solar cells</a> containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include <a href="/wiki/Monocrystalline_silicon" title="Monocrystalline silicon">monocrystalline silicon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polycrystalline_silicon" title="Polycrystalline silicon">polycrystalline silicon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amorphous_silicon" title="Amorphous silicon">amorphous silicon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium_telluride" title="Cadmium telluride">cadmium telluride</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Copper_indium_gallium_selenide" title="Copper indium gallium selenide">copper indium gallium selenide</a>/sulfide. <a href="/wiki/Copper_in_renewable_energy#Photovoltaic_system_configurations" title="Copper in renewable energy">Copper solar cables</a> connect modules (module cable), arrays (array cable), and sub-fields. Because of the growing demand for <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_system" title="Photovoltaic system">photovoltaic arrays</a> has advanced considerably in recent years.</p>
<p>Solar photovoltaics power generation has long been seen as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clean_energy" title="Clean energy">clean energy</a> technology which draws upon the planet’s most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source – the sun. The technology is "inherently elegant" in that the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts or environmental emissions during operation. It is well proven, as photovoltaic systems have now been used for fifty years in specialised applications, and grid-connected systems have been in use for over twenty years.</p>
<p>Cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly behind a glass sheet. When more power is required than a single cell can deliver, cells are electrically connected together to form photovoltaic modules, or solar panels. A single module is enough to power an emergency telephone, but for a house or a power plant the modules must be arranged in multiples as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_photovoltaic_array" title="Solar photovoltaic array">arrays</a>.</p>
<p>Photovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions (STC) in "W<sub>p</sub>" (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Watt-peak" title="Watt-peak">watts peak</a>). The actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized, or "rated," value, depending on geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors. Solar photovoltaic array <a href="/wiki/Capacity_factor" title="Capacity factor">capacity factors</a> are typically under 25%, which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_developments">Current developments</span></h2>
<p>For best performance, terrestrial PV systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun. <a href="/wiki/Solar_tracker" title="Solar tracker">Solar trackers</a> achieve this by moving PV panels to follow the sun. The increase can be by as much as 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the <a href="/wiki/Sun_path" title="Sun path">sun path</a>. Panels are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics.</p>
<p>A number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower, if the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zenith_distance" title="Zenith distance">zenith distance</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turntable_ladder#Turntable_ladder" title="Turntable ladder">ladder</a> mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular <a href="/wiki/Solar_panel" title="Solar panel">solar panel</a>. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the "ladder" may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polar_star" title="Polar star">polar star</a>, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (<a href="/wiki/Building-integrated_photovoltaics" title="Building-integrated photovoltaics">building-integrated photovoltaics</a>).</p>
<p>Another recent development involves the makeup of solar cells. <a href="/wiki/Perovskite" title="Perovskite">Perovskite</a> is a very inexpensive material which is being used to replace the expensive <a href="/wiki/Crystalline_silicon" title="Crystalline silicon">crystalline silicon</a> which is still part of a standard PV cell build to this day. Michael Graetzel, Director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at EPFL says, "Today, efficiency has peaked at 18 percent, but it's expected to get even higher in the future." This is a significant claim, as 20% efficiency is typical among solar panels which use more expensive materials.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Efficiency">Efficiency</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency" title="Solar cell efficiency">Solar cell efficiency</a></div>

<p>Electrical efficiency (also called conversion efficiency) is a contributing factor in the selection of a photovoltaic system. However, the most efficient solar panels are typically the most expensive, and may not be commercially available. Therefore, selection is also driven by cost efficiency and other factors.</p>
<p>The electrical efficiency of a PV cell is a <a href="/wiki/Physical_property" title="Physical property">physical property</a> which represents how much electrical power a cell can produce for a given <a href="/wiki/Solar_irradiance" title="Solar irradiance">insolation</a>. The basic expression for maximum efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is given by the ratio of output power to the incident solar power (radiation flux times area)</p>

<p>The efficiency is measured under ideal laboratory conditions and represents the maximum achievable efficiency of the PV material. Actual efficiency is influenced by the output Voltage, current, junction temperature, light intensity and spectrum.</p>
<p>The most efficient type of solar cell to date is a multi-junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of 46.0% produced by <a href="/wiki/Fraunhofer_Institute_for_Solar_Energy_Systems_ISE" title="Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE">Fraunhofer ISE</a> in December 2014. The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by <a href="/wiki/Sharp_Corporation" title="Sharp Corporation">Sharp Corporation</a> at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009, and Boeing Spectrolab (40.7% also using a triple-layer design). The US company <a href="/wiki/SunPower" title="SunPower">SunPower</a> produces cells that have an efficiency of 21.5%, well above the market average of 12–18%.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate <a href="/wiki/Band_gap" title="Band gap">band gap</a> that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (η&gt;30%) are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (η&gt;20%).</p>
<p>Recent developments in Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3% to over 15% since their introduction in the 1980s. To date, the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges from 6.7% to 8.94% for small molecule, 8.4%–10.6% for polymer OPVs, and 7% to 21% for perovskite OPVs. OPVs are expected to play a major role in the PV market. Recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost, while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable.</p>
<p>Several companies have begun embedding <a href="/wiki/Power_optimizer" title="Power optimizer">power optimizers</a> into PV modules called <a href="/wiki/Smart_module" title="Smart module">smart modules</a>. These modules perform <a href="/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracking" title="Maximum power point tracking">maximum power point tracking</a> (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease.</p>
<p>One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silica" title="Silica">silica</a>, and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the <a href="/wiki/Solar_cell" title="Solar cell">solar cells</a>, but reflects <a href="/wiki/Infrared" title="Infrared">infrared</a> rays (which carry heat).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics" title="Growth of photovoltaics">Growth of photovoltaics</a></div>


<p>Solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly and worldwide installed capacity reached at least 177 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">gigawatts</a> (GW) by the end of 2014. The total power output of the world’s PV capacity in a calendar year is now beyond 200 TWh of electricity. This represents 1% of worldwide electricity demand. More than 100 <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_by_country" title="Solar power by country">countries</a> use solar PV. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Solar power in the People's Republic of China">China</a>, followed by <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Japan" title="Solar power in Japan">Japan</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_States" title="Solar power in the United States">United States</a> is now the fastest growing market, while <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Germany" title="Solar power in Germany">Germany</a> remains the world's largest producer, contributing more than 7% to its national electricity demands. Photovoltaics is now, after hydro and wind power, the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity.</p>
<p>Several market research and financial companies foresee record-breaking global installation of more than 50 GW in 2015. China is predicted to take the lead from Germany and to become the world's largest producer of PV power by installing another targeted 17.8 GW in 2015. India is expected to install 1.8 GW, doubling its annual installations. By 2018, worldwide photovoltaic capacity is projected to doubled or even triple to 430 GW. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Photovoltaic_Industry_Association" title="European Photovoltaic Industry Association">Solar Power Europe</a> (formerly known as EPIA) also estimates that photovoltaics will meet 10% to 15% of Europe's energy demand in 2030.</p>
<p>The EPIA/<a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> Solar Generation Paradigm Shift Scenario (formerly called Advanced Scenario) from 2010 shows that by the year 2030, 1,845 GW of PV systems could be generating approximately 2,646 TWh/year of electricity around the world. Combined with <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy use efficiency</a> improvements, this would represent the electricity needs of more than 9% of the world's population. By 2050, over 20% of all electricity could be provided by photovoltaics.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Michael_Liebreich" title="Michael Liebreich">Michael Liebreich</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.#New_Energy_Finance" title="Bloomberg L.P.">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>, anticipates a tipping point for solar energy. The costs of power from wind and solar are already below those of conventional electricity generation in some parts of the world, as they have fallen sharply and will continue to do so. He also asserts, that the electrical grid has been greatly expanded worldwide, and is ready to receive and distribute electricity from renewable sources. In addition, worldwide electricity prices came under strong pressure from renewable energy sources, that are, in part, enthusiastically embraced by consumers.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Deutsche_Bank" title="Deutsche Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> sees a "second gold rush" for the photovoltaic industry to come. <a href="/wiki/Grid_parity" title="Grid parity">Grid parity</a> has already been reached in at least 19 markets by January 2014. Photovoltaics will prevail beyond <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariffs</a>, becoming more competitive as deployment increases and prices continue to fall.</p>
<p>In June 2014 <a href="/wiki/Barclays" title="Barclays">Barclays</a> downgraded bonds of U.S. utility companies. Barclays expects more competition by a growing self-consumption due to a combination of decentralized PV-systems and residential <a href="/wiki/Energy_storage" title="Energy storage">electricity storage</a>. This could fundamentally change the utility's business model and transform the system over the next ten years, as prices for these systems are predicted to fall.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impacts_of_photovoltaic_technologies">Environmental impacts of photovoltaic technologies</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Types of impacts</b></i></p>
<p>While solar photovoltaic (PV) cells are promising for clean energy production, their deployment is hindered by production costs, material availability, and toxicity. <a href="/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment" title="Life-cycle assessment">Life cycle assessment</a> (LCA) is one method of determining environmental impacts from PV. Many studies have been done on the various types of PV including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_generation_solar_cell" title="First generation solar cell">first generation</a>, second generation, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Generation_Solar_Cell" title="Third Generation Solar Cell">third generation</a>. Usually these PV LCA studies select a cradle to gate system boundary because often at the time the studies are conducted, it is a new technology not commercially available yet and their required balance of system components and disposal methods are unknown.</p>
<p>A traditional LCA can look at many different impact categories ranging from <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">global warming potential</a>, eco-toxicity, human toxicity, water depletion, and many others. Most LCAs of PV have focused on two categories: carbon dioxide equivalents per kWh and energy pay-back time (EPBT). The EPBT is defined as " the time needed to compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system". A 2015 review of EPBT from first and second generation PV suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a greater reduction in EPBT. One difficulty in determining impacts due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the manufacturing phase. Research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of PV systems.</p>
<p><i><b>Impacts from first-generation PV</b></i></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Crystalline_silicon" title="Crystalline silicon">Crystalline silicon</a> modules are the most extensively studied PV type in terms of LCA since they are the most commonly used. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mono-crystalline_silicon_cell" title="Mono-crystalline silicon cell">Mono-crystalline silicon</a> photovoltaic systems (mono-si) have an average efficiency of 14.0%. The cells tend to follow a structure of front electrode, anti-reflection film, n-layer, p-layer, and back electrode, with the sun hitting the front electrode. EPBT ranges from 1.7 to 2.7 years. The cradle to gate of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh ranges from 37.3 to 72.2 grams.</p>
<p>Techniques to produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multi-crystalline_silicon" title="Multi-crystalline silicon">multi-crystalline silicon</a> (multi-si) photovoltaic cells are simpler and cheaper than mono-si, however tend to make less efficient cells, an average of 13.2%. EPBT ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years. The cradle to gate of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams. Some studies have looked beyond EPBT and GWP to other environmental impacts. In one such study, conventional energy mix in Greece was compared to multi-si PV and found a 95% overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens, eco-toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and eleven others.</p>
<p><i><b>Impacts from second generation</b></i></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cadmium_telluride_photovoltaics" title="Cadmium telluride photovoltaics">Cadmium telluride</a> (CdTe) is one of the fastest-growing <a href="/wiki/Thin-film_solar_cell" title="Thin-film solar cell">thin film based solar cells</a> which are collectively known as second generation devices. This new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions (<a href="/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit" title="Shockley–Queisser limit">Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit</a>) as conventional Si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008. This technology’s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%. The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2 mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS buffer layer (50–150 nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.</p>
<p>CdTe PV systems require less energy input in their production than other commercial PV systems per unit electricity production. The average CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh is around 18 grams (cradle to gate). CdTe has the fastest EPBT of all commercial PV technologies, which varies between 0.3 and 1.2 years.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Copper_indium_gallium_selenide" title="Copper indium gallium selenide">Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide</a> (CIGS) is a thin film solar cell based on the copper indium diselenide (CIS) family of chalcopyrite <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductors</a>. CIS and CIGS are often used interchangeably within the CIS/CIGS community. The cell structure includes soda lime glass as the substrate, Mo layer as the back contact, CIS/CIGS as the absorber layer, cadmium sulfide (CdS) or Zn (S,OH)x as the buffer layer, and ZnO:Al as the front contact. CIGS is approximately 1/100th the thickness of conventional silicon solar cell technologies. Materials necessary for assembly are readily available, and are less costly per watt of solar cell. CIGS based solar devices resist performance degradation over time and are highly stable in the field.</p>
<p>Reported global warming potential impacts of CIGS range from 20.5 – 58.8 grams CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh of electricity generated for different <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_irradiation" title="Solar irradiation">solar irradiation</a> (1,700 to 2,200 kWh/m/y) and power conversion efficiency (7.8 – 9.12%). EPBT ranges from 0.2 to 1.4 years, while harmonized value of EPBT was found 1.393 years. Toxicity is an issue within the buffer layer of CIGS modules because it contains cadmium and gallium. CIS modules do not contain any heavy metals.</p>
<p><i><b>Impacts from third generation</b></i></p>
<p>Third-generation PVs are designed to combine the advantages of both the first and second generation devices and they do not have Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit, a theoretical limit for first and second generation PV cells. The thickness of a third generation device is less than 1 µm.</p>
<p>One emerging alternative and promising technology is based on an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell made of methylammonium lead halide perovskites. <a href="/wiki/Perovskite_solar_cell" title="Perovskite solar cell">Perovskite PV cells</a> have progressed rapidly over the past few years and have become one of the most attractive areas for PV research. The cell structure includes a metal back contact (which can be made of Al, Au or Ag), a hole transfer layer (spiro-MeOTAD, P3HT, PTAA, CuSCN, CuI, or NiO), and absorber layer (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbIxBr<sub>3</sub>-x, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbIxCl<sub>3</sub>-x or CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>), an electron transport layer (TiO, ZnO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or SnO<sub>2</sub>) and a top contact layer (fluorine doped tin oxide or tin doped indium oxide).</p>
<p>There are a limited number of published studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells.  The major environmental concern is the lead used in the absorber layer. Due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the use phase. These LCA studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue. Global warming potential of perovskite PVs were found to be in the range of 24–1500 grams CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh electricity production. Similarly, reported EPBT of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years. The large range of reported values highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies. Celik et al. (2016) critically discussed the assumptions made in perovskite PV LCA studies.<a class="external free" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024816300605" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024816300605</a></p>
<p>Two new promising thin film technologies are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Copper_zinc_tin_sulfide" title="Copper zinc tin sulfide">copper zinc tin sulfide</a> (Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> or CZTS) and <a href="/wiki/Zinc_phosphide" title="Zinc phosphide">zinc phosphide</a> (Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>). Both of these thin films are currently only produced in the lab but may be commercialized in the future. Their manufacturing processes are expected to be similar to those of current thin film technologies of CIGS and CdTe, respectively. Yet, contrary to CIGS and CdTe, CZTS and Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> are made from earth abundant, nontoxic materials and have the potential to produce more electricity annually than the current worldwide consumption. While CZTS and Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> offer good promise for these reasons, the specific environmental implications of their commercial production are not yet known. Global warming potential of CZTS and Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> were found 38 and 30 grams CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh while their corresponding EPBT were found 1.85 and 0.78 years, respectively. Overall, CdTe and Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> have similar environmental impacts but can slightly outperform CIGS and CZTS.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Organic_solar_cell" title="Organic solar cell">Organic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polymer_solar_cell" title="Polymer solar cell">polymer photovoltaic</a> (OPV) are a relatively new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, tunnel junction, holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly. OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production. OPV uses "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times". Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%, however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.</p>
<p>Many different configurations of OPV exist using different materials for each layer. OPV technology rivals existing PV technologies in terms of EPBT even if they currently present a shorter operational lifetime. A 2013 study analyzed 12 different configurations all with 2% efficiency, the EPBT ranged from 0.29–0.52 years for 1 m² of PV. The average CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh for OPV is 54.922 grams.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h2>

<p>There have been major changes in the underlying costs, industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology, over the years, and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge. This is due to: "the rapidity of cost and price changes, the complexity of the PV supply chain, which involves a large number of manufacturing processes, the balance of system (BOS) and installation costs associated with complete PV systems, the choice of different distribution channels, and differences between regional markets within which PV is being deployed". Further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries.</p>
<p>The PV industry has seen dramatic drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of <a href="/wiki/Grid_parity" title="Grid parity">grid parity</a> for PV. Technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Financial_incentives_for_photovoltaics" title="Financial incentives for photovoltaics">Financial incentives for photovoltaics</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariffs</a>, have often been offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems. Government has sometimes also offered incentives in order to encourage the PV industry to achieve the <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> needed to compete where the cost of PV-generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid. Such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial <a href="/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy independence</a>, <a href="/wiki/High_tech" title="High tech">high tech</a> job creation and reduction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon dioxide emissions</a> which cause global warming. Due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy more—as manufacturers increase production to meet demand, the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come.</p>
<p>Solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Concentrated_photovoltaics" title="Concentrated photovoltaics">concentrated photovoltaics</a>. Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 14–22%. Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns (through magnifying lens) onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell. However, such concentrated solar power requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy.</p>
<p>Crystalline silicon solar cell prices have fallen from $76.67/Watt in 1977 to an estimated $0.74/Watt in 2013. This is seen as evidence supporting <a href="/wiki/Swanson%27s_law" title="Swanson's law">Swanson's law</a>, an observation similar to the famous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moore%27s_Law" title="Moore's Law">Moore's Law</a> that states that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity.</p>
<p>As of 2011, the price of PV modules has fallen by 60% since the summer of 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries; an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75% from 2007 to 2012 has also been published, though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the United States or generally global. The levelised cost of electricity (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LCOE" title="LCOE">LCOE</a>) from PV is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions, particularly when the time of generation is included, as electricity is worth more during the day than at night. There has been fierce competition in the supply chain, and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years. As time progresses, renewable energy technologies generally get cheaper, while fossil fuels generally get more expensive:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The less solar power costs, the more favorably it compares to conventional power, and the more attractive it becomes to utilities and energy users around the globe. Utility-scale solar power can now be delivered in California at prices well below $100/MWh ($0.10/kWh) less than most other peak generators, even those running on low-cost natural gas. Lower solar module costs also stimulate demand from consumer markets where the cost of solar compares very favorably to retail electric rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of 2011, the cost of PV has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further. The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For large-scale installations, prices below $1.00/watt were achieved. A module price of 0.60 Euro/watt ($0.78/watt) was published for a large scale 5-year deal in April 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of 2012, the "best in class" module price had dropped to $0.50/watt, and was expected to drop to $0.36/watt by 2017.</p>
<p>In many locations, PV has reached grid parity, which is usually defined as PV production costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). However, in many countries there is still a need for more access to capital to develop PV projects. To solve this problem <a href="/wiki/Securitization" title="Securitization">securitization</a> has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects. For example, <a href="/wiki/SolarCity" title="SolarCity">SolarCity</a> offered, the first U.S. <a href="/wiki/Asset-backed_security" title="Asset-backed security">asset-backed security</a> in the solar industry in 2013.</p>
<p>Photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23 GW in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, due to support cuts in the large markets of Germany and Italy, strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.</p>
<p>In the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid. Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies. Traditionally, DC generated electricity from solar PV must be converted to AC for buildings, at an average 10% loss during the conversion. An additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057.13 to $8,213.64 (analysis from 2009).</p>
<p>For example, in Germany with electricity prices of 0.25 euro/kWh and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insolation" title="Insolation">Insolation</a> of 900 kWh/kW one kW<sub>p</sub> will save 225 euro per year and with installation cost of 1700 euro/kW<sub>p</sub> means that the system will pay back in less than 7 years.</p>

<p>Overall the manufacturing process of creating solar photovoltaics is simple in that it does not require the culmination of many complex or moving parts. Because of the solid state nature of PV systems they often have relatively long lifetimes, anywhere from 10 to 30 years. In order to increase electrical output of a PV system the manufacturer must simply add more photovoltaic components and because of this economies of scale are important for manufacturers as costs decrease with increasing output.</p>
<p>While there are many types of PV systems known to be effective, crystalline silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.</p>
<p>Crystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of PV, and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs.</p>
<p>Another newer technology, thin-film PV, are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.</p>
<p>Other emerging PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized, quantum-dot, and Perovskite photovoltaics. OPVs fall into the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which is lower than the 12–21% typically seen by silicon based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they have not reached greater than 10% efficiency. Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.</p>

<p>A photovoltaic system, or solar PV system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, <a href="/wiki/Rooftop_photovoltaic_power_station" title="Rooftop photovoltaic power station">roof-top mounted</a> or <a href="/wiki/Building-integrated_photovoltaics" title="Building-integrated photovoltaics">building-integrated</a> systems with capacities from a few to several tens of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatts" title="Kilowatts">kilowatts</a>, to large utility-scale <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_station" title="Photovoltaic power station">power stations</a> of hundreds of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatts" title="Megawatts">megawatts</a>.

<p>The 122 <a href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power)#petawatt_.281015_watts.29" title="Orders of magnitude (power)">PW</a> of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface is plentiful—almost 10,000 times more than the 13 TW equivalent of average power consumed in 2005 by humans. This abundance leads to the suggestion that it will not be long before solar energy will become the world's primary energy source. Additionally, solar electric generation has the highest power density (global mean of 170 W/m) among renewable energies.</p>
<p>Solar power is pollution-free during use. Production end-wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls. End-of-use recycling technologies are under development and policies are being produced that encourage recycling from producers.</p>
<p>PV installations can operate for 100 years or even more with little maintenance or intervention after their initial set-up, so after the initial <a href="/wiki/Capital_cost" title="Capital cost">capital cost</a> of building any solar power plant, <a href="/wiki/Operating_cost" title="Operating cost">operating costs</a> are extremely low compared to existing power technologies.</p>
<p>Grid-connected solar electricity can be used locally thus reducing transmission/distribution losses (transmission losses in the US were approximately 7.2% in 1995).</p>
<p>Compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources, very little research money has been invested in the development of solar cells, so there is considerable room for improvement. Nevertheless, experimental <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_efficiency_solar_cells" title="High efficiency solar cells">high efficiency solar cells</a> already have efficiencies of over 40% in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass-production costs are rapidly falling.</p>
<p>In some states of the United States, much of the investment in a home-mounted system may be lost if the home-owner moves and the buyer puts less value on the system than the seller. The city of <a href="/wiki/Berkeley,_California" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a> developed an innovative financing method to remove this limitation, by adding a tax assessment that is transferred with the home to pay for the solar panels. Now known as <a href="/wiki/PACE_financing" title="PACE financing">PACE</a>, Property Assessed Clean Energy, 30 U.S. states have duplicated this solution.</p>
<p>There is evidence, at least in California, that the presence of a home-mounted solar system can actually increase the value of a home. According to a paper published in April 2011 by the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory titled An Analysis of the Effects of Residential Photovoltaic Energy Systems on Home Sales Prices in California:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The research finds strong evidence that homes with PV systems in California have sold for a premium over comparable homes without PV systems. More specifically, estimates for average PV premiums range from approximately $3.9 to $6.4 per installed watt (DC) among a large number of different model specifications, with most models coalescing near $5.5/watt. That value corresponds to a premium of approximately $17,000 for a relatively new 3,100 watt PV system (the average size of PV systems in the study).</p>
