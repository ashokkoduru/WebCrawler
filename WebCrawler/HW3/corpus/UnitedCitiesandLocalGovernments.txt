<p><b>United Cities and Local Governments</b> (<b>UCLG</b>) is an umbrella organisation for cities, local governments, and municipal associations throughout the world. United Cities and Local Governments was founded in 2004, when the existing local government organisations - the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA), the United Towns Organisations (UTO), and Metropolis – united their respective global networks of cities and national associations of local governments in a single organisation. United Cities and Local Governments' headquarters, the World Secretariat, is based in Barcelona, Spain. UCLG is the largest local government organisation in the world and understands itself as the united voice and world advocate of democratic local self-government, de facto representing over half the world's population, the cities and association members of UCLG are present in over 120 UN Member States across seven world regions:</p>
