<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p><b>Carbon dioxide removal</b> (CDR) methods refers to a number of technologies which reduce the levels of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere">in the atmosphere</a>. Among such technologies are <a href="/wiki/Bio-energy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage">bio-energy with carbon capture and storage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">biochar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">direct air capture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ocean_fertilization" title="Ocean fertilization">ocean fertilization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_weathering" title="Enhanced weathering">enhanced weathering</a>. CDR is a different approach than removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the stack emissions of large <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> point sources, such as <a href="/wiki/Power_station" title="Power station">power stations</a>. The latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. As CDR removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it creates <a href="/wiki/Negative_carbon_dioxide_emission" title="Negative carbon dioxide emission">negative emissions</a>, offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems, airplanes and vehicle exhausts. It is regarded by some as a form of <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a>, while other commentators describe it as a form of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> or extreme mitigation. Whether CDR would satisfy common definitions of "climate engineering" or "geoengineering" usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken.</p>
<p>The likely need for CDR has been publicly expressed by a range of individuals and organizations involved with climate change issues, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IPCC" title="IPCC">IPCC</a> chief <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rajendra_Pachauri" title="Rajendra Pachauri">Rajendra Pachauri</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFCCC" title="UNFCCC">UNFCCC</a> executive secretary <a href="/wiki/Christiana_Figueres" title="Christiana Figueres">Christiana Figueres</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Watch_Institute" title="World Watch Institute">World Watch Institute</a>. Institutions with major programs focusing on CDR include the Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth_Institute" title="Earth Institute">Earth Institute, Columbia University</a>, and the Climate Decision Making Center, an international collaboration operated out of Carnegie-Mellon University's Department of Engineering and Public Policy.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming" title="Mitigation of global warming">mitigation</a> effectiveness of air capture is limited by societal investment, land use, availability of geologic reservoirs, and leakage. The reservoirs are estimated to be sufficient to for storing at least 545 GtC. Storing 771 GtC would cause an 186 ppm atmospheric reduction. In order to return the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content to 350 ppm we need atmospheric reduction of 50 ppm plus an additional 2 ppm per year of current emissions.</p>

<p>Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, uses biomass to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and carbon capture and storage technologies to concentrate and permanently store it in deep geological formations.</p>
<p>BECCS is currently (as of October 2012) the only CDR technology deployed at full industrial scale, with 550 000 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>/year in total capacity operating, divided between three different facilities (as of January 2012).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">Biochar</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">Biochar</a> is created by the <a href="/wiki/Pyrolysis" title="Pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a> of <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>, and is under investigation as a method of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sequestration" title="Carbon sequestration">carbon sequestration</a>. <a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">Biochar</a> is a charcoal that is used for agricultural purposes which also aids in <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sequestration" title="Carbon sequestration">carbon sequestration</a>, the capture or hold of carbon. It is created using a process called pyrolysis, which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels. What remains is a material known as char, similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process, thus the use of biomass. Biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms, most commonly plants or plant based material. The offset of GHG emission, if biochar were to be implemented, would be a maximum of 12%. This equates to about 106 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents. On a medium conservative level, it would be 23% less than that, at 82 metric tons. A study done by the UK Biochar Research Center has stated that, on a conservative level, biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year. With greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar, the benefit would the storage of 5-9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Enhanced_weathering">Enhanced weathering</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_weathering" title="Enhanced weathering">Enhanced weathering</a></div>
<p>Enhanced weathering refers to chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques. Examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are in-situ carbonation of silicates. <a href="/wiki/Ultramafic_rock" title="Ultramafic rock">Ultramafic rock</a>, for example, has the potential to store thousands of years worth of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions according to one estimate. Ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement, such as, grinding, dispersing and dissolving olivine, limestone, silicates, or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration. Enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of geoengineering options. One example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the <a href="/wiki/CarbFix" title="CarbFix">CarbFix</a> project in Iceland.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Direct_air_capture">Direct air capture</span></h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be removed from ambient air through chemical processes, sequestered, and stored. One proposed method is by so-called <i>artificial trees</i>. This concept, proposed by climate scientist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wallace_S._Broecker" title="Wallace S. Broecker">Wallace S. Broecker</a> and science writer <a href="/wiki/Robert_Kunzig" title="Robert Kunzig">Robert Kunzig</a>, imagines huge numbers of artificial trees around the world to remove ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. The technology is now being pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Klaus_Lackner" title="Klaus Lackner">Klaus Lackner</a>, a researcher at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth_Institute" title="Earth Institute">Earth Institute</a>, <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>, whose artificial tree technology can suck up to 1,000 times more CO<sub>2</sub> from the air than real trees can, at a rate of about one ton of carbon per day if the artificial tree is approximately the size of an actual tree. The CO<sub>2</sub> would be captured in a filter and then removed from the filter and stored.</p>
<p><br/>
The chemistry used is a variant of that described <a href="#Example_CO2_scrubbing_chemistry">below</a>, as it is based on <a href="/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide" title="Sodium hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>. However, in a more recent design proposed by <a href="/wiki/Klaus_Lackner" title="Klaus Lackner">Klaus Lackner</a>, the process can be carried out at only 40 °C by using a <a href="/wiki/Polymer" title="Polymer">polymer</a>-based <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ion_exchange_resin" title="Ion exchange resin">ion exchange resin</a>, which takes advantage of changes in <a href="/wiki/Humidity" title="Humidity">humidity</a> to prompt the release of captured CO<sub>2</sub>, instead of using a kiln. This reduces the energy required to operate the process.</p>
<p>Another substance which can be used are <a href="/wiki/Metal-organic_framework" title="Metal-organic framework">Metal-organic frameworks</a> (or MOF's). A special MOF has been made specifically for locking CO<sub>2</sub> by Joeri Denayer.</p>
<p>In 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Discovery_Channel" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a> covered the work of <a href="/wiki/David_Keith_(scientist)" title="David Keith (scientist)">David Keith</a>, of <a href="/wiki/University_of_Calgary" title="University of Calgary">University of Calgary</a>, who built a tower, 4 feet wide and 20 feet tall (1.2×6.1 meters), with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in, which comes out again at the top. In the process, about half the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the air.</p>
<p>This device uses the chemical process described in detail <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal#Example_CO2_scrubbing_chemistry" title="Carbon dioxide removal">below</a>. The system demonstrated on the Discovery Channel was a 1/90,000th scale test system of the capture section; the reagents are regenerated in a separate facility. The main costs of a full plant will be the cost to build it, and the energy input to regenerate the chemicals and produce a pure stream of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, people in the U.S. emit about 20 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per person annually. In other words, each person in the U.S. would require a tower like the one featured by the Discovery Channel to remove this amount of CO<sub>2</sub> from the air, requiring an annual 2 megawatt-hours of electricity to operate it. By comparison, a refrigerator consumes about 1.2 megawatt-hours annually (2001 figures). But, by combining many small systems such as this into one large system, the construction costs and energy use can be reduced.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the <a href="/wiki/Solar_updraft_tower" title="Solar updraft tower">Solar updraft tower</a> to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used at the same time for amine gravity scrubbing of CO<sub>2</sub>. Some heat would be required to regenerate the amine.</p>
<p>Finally, a similar CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber has also been build by <a href="/wiki/Carbon_Engineering" title="Carbon Engineering">Carbon Engineering</a>. Besides simply focusing on capturing the CO<sub>2</sub>, the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the CO<sub>2</sub>, for example in the production of fuels, which would thus be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zero_emissions" title="Zero emissions">carbon-neutral</a>.</p>
<p>Direct air capture has been proposed as a way of generating carbon-neutral organic chemicals, by harvesting the atmospheric compounds and then using them in the production and synthesis of polymers and fuels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ocean_fertilization">Ocean fertilization</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ocean_fertilization" title="Ocean fertilization">Ocean fertilization</a></div>
<p>Ocean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A number of techniques, including fertilization by iron, urea and phosphorus have been proposed.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Potassium_Hydroxide">Potassium Hydroxide</span></h3>
<p>Zeman and Lackner outlined a specific method of air capture using <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber#Potassium_hydroxide" title="Carbon dioxide scrubber">sodium hydroxide</a>. Carbon Engineering, a Calgary, Alberta firm founded in 2009 and partially funded by <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gates" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>, is developing a process to capture carbon dioxide using a solution of potassium hydroxide mixed with some water at their <a href="/wiki/Pilot_plant" title="Pilot plant">pilot plant</a> . They hope to create and sell synthetic fuels at a cost of $100 a ton.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_issues">Economic issues</span></h2>
<p>A crucial issue for CDR methods is their cost, which differs substantially among the different technologies: some of these are not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments. The <a href="/wiki/American_Physical_Society" title="American Physical Society">American Physical Society</a> estimates the costs for direct air capture to be $600/tonne with optimistic assumptions. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Ecofys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ecofys (page does not exist)">Ecofys</a> provides an estimate that 3.5 billion tonnes could be removed annually from the atmosphere with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BECCS" title="BECCS">BECCS</a> (Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage) at carbon prices as low as €50, whereas a report from <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Biorecro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Biorecro (page does not exist)">Biorecro</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage_(timeline)#Global_Carbon_Capture_and_Storage_Institute" title="Carbon capture and storage (timeline)">Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute</a> estimates costs "below €100" per tonne for large scale BECCS deployment.</p>
