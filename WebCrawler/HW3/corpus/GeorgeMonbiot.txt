<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>George Monbiot was born in <a href="/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Hospital,_London" title="St Mary's Hospital, London">St Mary's, Paddington</a>, a public hospital in what was then the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Paddington" title="Metropolitan Borough of Paddington">Metropolitan Borough of Paddington</a>. The birth was registered in the Metropolitan Borough of <a href="/wiki/Kensington" title="Kensington">Kensington</a>. He grew up in <a href="/wiki/Henley-on-Thames" title="Henley-on-Thames">Henley-on-Thames</a> in South Oxfordshire, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, in a house next to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peppard_Common" title="Peppard Common">Peppard Common</a>. Politics was at the heart of family life—his father, Raymond Geoffrey Monbiot, is a businessman who headed the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>'s trade and industry forum, while his mother, Rosalie—the elder daughter of Conservative MP <a href="/wiki/Roger_Gresham_Cooke" title="Roger Gresham Cooke">Roger Gresham Cooke</a>—was a Conservative councillor who led <a href="/wiki/South_Oxfordshire" title="South Oxfordshire">South Oxfordshire District Council</a> for a decade.</p>
<p>His uncle, Canon Hereward Cooke, was the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> deputy leader of <a href="/wiki/Norwich_City_Council" title="Norwich City Council">Norwich City Council</a> between 2002 and 2006. Monbiot was educated at <a href="/wiki/Stowe_School" title="Stowe School">Stowe School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Buckinghamshire" title="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Independent_school_(UK)" title="Independent school (UK)">independent school</a>, and won an open scholarship to <a href="/wiki/Brasenose_College,_Oxford" title="Brasenose College, Oxford">Brasenose College, Oxford</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>

<p>After graduating in zoology, Monbiot joined the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Natural_History_Unit" title="BBC Natural History Unit">BBC Natural History Unit</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Radio_producer" title="Radio producer">radio producer</a>, making <a href="/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">natural history</a> and environmental programmes. He transferred to the BBC's <a href="/wiki/BBC_World_Service" title="BBC World Service">World Service</a>, where he worked briefly as a <a href="/wiki/Current_affairs_(news_format)" title="Current affairs (news format)">current affairs</a> producer and presenter, before leaving to research and write his first book.</p>
<p>Working as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Investigative_journalist" title="Investigative journalist">investigative journalist</a>, he travelled in <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and <a href="/wiki/East_Africa" title="East Africa">East Africa</a>. His activities led to his being made <i><a href="/wiki/Persona_non_grata" title="Persona non grata">persona non grata</a></i> in seven countries and being sentenced to life imprisonment <i><a href="/wiki/Trial_in_absentia" title="Trial in absentia">in absentia</a></i> in Indonesia. In these places, he was also shot at, beaten up by military police, shipwrecked and stung into a poisoned coma by hornets. He came back to work in Britain after being pronounced clinically dead in <a href="/wiki/Lodwar" title="Lodwar">Lodwar</a> General Hospital in north-western <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, having contracted <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cerebral_malaria" title="Cerebral malaria">cerebral malaria</a>.</p>
<p>In Britain, he joined the <a href="/wiki/Road_protest_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Road protest in the United Kingdom">roads protest</a> movement and was often called to give press interviews; as a result he was denounced as a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Media_tart" title="Media tart">media tart</a>" by groups such as <a href="/wiki/Green_Anarchist" title="Green Anarchist">Green Anarchist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Class_War" title="Class War">Class War</a>. He was attacked by security guards, who allegedly drove a metal spike through his foot, smashing the middle metatarsal bone. His injuries left him in hospital. Sir <a href="/wiki/Crispin_Tickell" title="Crispin Tickell">Crispin Tickell</a>, a former British diplomat at the United Nations, who was then <a href="/wiki/Warden_(college)" title="Warden (college)">Warden</a> at <a href="/wiki/Green_Templeton_College,_Oxford#Green_College" title="Green Templeton College, Oxford">Green College, Oxford</a>, made the young protester a <a href="/wiki/Fellow#Oxford.2C_Cambridge_and_Dublin" title="Fellow">Visiting Fellow</a>. He was an active member of the Pure Genius!! campaign and co-founded <a href="/wiki/The_Land_is_Ours" title="The Land is Ours">The Land is Ours</a>, which has occupied land at several locations in Britain. Its first high-profile success was in 1997, when it occupied thirteen <a href="/wiki/Acre" title="Acre">acres</a> (five <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectares</a>) of prime real estate on the river in London on which its owner, beverages multinational <a href="/wiki/Diageo" title="Diageo">Diageo</a>, intended to build a superstore. The protesters defeated Diageo in court, built an "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eco-village" title="Eco-village">eco-village</a>," and held on to the land for six months.</p>
<p>Among his best-known articles are his critique of <a href="/wiki/David_Bellamy" title="David Bellamy">David Bellamy</a>'s climate science, his description of an encounter with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Police_torture" title="Police torture">police torturer</a> in Brazil, his attack on <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> interpretations of genetics, his discussion of the ethics of <a href="/wiki/Outsourcing" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a>, and his attack on the politics of <a href="/wiki/Bob_Geldof" title="Bob Geldof">Bob Geldof</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bono" title="Bono">Bono</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2011, Monbiot took the unusual step of publishing an account of his assets. In the interests of transparency, Monbiot explained that he earned £77,400 a year, gross, from publishing contracts and rents, and urged other journalists to follow suit. He continues to publish his financial accounts on his website.</p>
<p>He has held <a href="/wiki/Visiting_scholar" title="Visiting scholar">visiting fellowships or professorships</a> at the universities of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a> (environmental policy), <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bristol" title="University of Bristol">Bristol</a> (philosophy), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Keele" title="University of Keele">Keele</a> (politics), <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Brookes_University" title="Oxford Brookes University">Oxford Brookes</a> (planning), and <a href="/wiki/University_of_East_London" title="University of East London">East London</a> (environmental science).</p>
<p>Monbiot lived in <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> for many years, but in 2007 moved with his then-wife, writer and campaigner Angharad Penrhyn Jones, and daughter to a <a href="/wiki/Low-energy_house" title="Low-energy house">low emissions house</a> in the mid-Wales market town of <a href="/wiki/Machynlleth" title="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a>. Monbiot's second daughter was born in the spring of 2012. Because his new partner lives in Oxford, Monbiot had returned there by 2013.</p>
<p>In November 2012, he apologised to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lord_McAlpine" title="Lord McAlpine">Lord McAlpine</a> for his "stupidity and thoughtlessness" in implying, in a tweet, that the Tory peer was a paedophile. In March 2013, Monbiot announced on his blog the details of a settlement reached with Lord McAlpine's representatives. Monbiot agreed "to carry out, over the next three years, work on behalf of three charities of my choice whose value amounts to £25,000," which he described as an "unprecedented settlement".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Activism">Activism</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate_change">Climate change</span></h3>
<p>Monbiot believes that drastic action coupled with strong political will is needed to combat <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. Monbiot has written that <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> is the "moral question of the 21st century" and that there is an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change, including: setting targets on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greenhouse_emissions" title="Greenhouse emissions">greenhouse emissions</a> using the latest science; issuing every citizen with a "personal carbon ration"; new building regulations with houses built to German <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Passivhaus" title="Passivhaus">passivhaus</a></i> standards; banning <a href="/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb" title="Incandescent light bulb">incandescent light bulbs</a>, patio heaters, garden floodlights, and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications; constructing large offshore <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_farms" title="Wind farms">wind farms</a>; replacing the national gas grid with a <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> pipe network; a new national coach network to make journeys using <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public transport</a> faster than using a car; all petrol stations to supply leasable electric <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_batteries" title="Car batteries">car batteries</a> with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries; scrap road-building and road-widening programmes, redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change; reduce UK airport capacity by 90 percent; closing down all out-of-town superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system.</p>
<p>Monbiot says the campaign against climate change is "unlike almost all the public protests" that came before it. "It is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity. It is a campaign not for more freedom but for less. Strangest of all, it is a campaign not just against other people, but against ourselves."</p>
<p>Monbiot also thinks that economic recession can be a good thing for the planet: "Is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land, and should seek to stay there? Why would we want to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse? Surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible?" While he does recognize that recession can cause hardship, he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well. For example, the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth, but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution.</p>
<p>Monbiot purchased a used diesel <a href="/wiki/Renault_Clio" title="Renault Clio">Renault Clio</a> after moving to <a href="/wiki/Machynlleth" title="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a> in 2007. He has travelled through Canada and the United States, campaigning on climate change and promoting his book. He contends that this travel was justifiable as it sought to boost the case for much greater carbon cuts there.</p>
<p>He is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Patron" title="Patron">patron</a> of the UK student campaign network <a href="/wiki/People_%26_Planet" title="People &amp; Planet">People &amp; Planet</a> and appears in the film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Age_of_Stupid" title="The Age of Stupid">The Age of Stupid</a></i> in animated form, in which he says "The very fact that the crisis is taking place within our generation, it's happening right now, means that we are tremendously powerful people. So this position of despair and 'I can't do anything' and 'there's no point' is completely illogical, it's exactly the opposite".</p>
<p>Monbiot attended the <a href="/wiki/2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference" title="2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference">2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference</a> held in <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>.</p>
<p>Monbiot once expressed deep antipathy to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_industry" title="Nuclear industry">nuclear industry</a>. He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011. Although he "still loathe[s] the liars who run the nuclear industry", Monbiot now advocates its use, having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the <a href="/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" title="2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami">2011 Japan tsunami</a> on nuclear reactors in the region. Subsequently, he has harshly condemned the <a href="/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement" title="Anti-nuclear movement">anti-nuclear movement</a>, writing that it "has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health...made [claims] ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong." He singled out <a href="/wiki/Helen_Caldicott" title="Helen Caldicott">Helen Caldicott</a> for, he wrote, making unsourced and inaccurate claims, dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up, and overstating the death toll from the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a> by a factor of more than 140. In October 2013 Monbiot criticized the selection of a <a href="/wiki/Generation_III_reactor" title="Generation III reactor">generation III reactor</a> design for the <a href="/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station" title="Hinkley Point C nuclear power station">Hinkley Point C nuclear power station</a> due to <a href="/wiki/Economics_of_nuclear_power_plants" title="Economics of nuclear power plants">cost</a> as well as for a half century requirement of <a href="/wiki/Uranium_mining" title="Uranium mining">uranium mining</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transuranic_waste" title="Transuranic waste">transuranic waste</a> production. He contrasted this with two <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">generation IV reactor</a> concepts: "if <a href="/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor" title="Integral fast reactor">integral fast reactors</a> were deployed, the UK's stockpile of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_waste" title="Nuclear waste">nuclear waste</a> could be used to generate enough <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low-carbon_energy" title="Low-carbon energy">low-carbon energy</a> to meet all UK demand for 500 years. These reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained: solving three huge problems—energy supply, nuclear waste and climate change—at once. <a href="/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor" title="Liquid fluoride thorium reactor">Thorium reactors</a> use an element that's already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries. They recycle their own waste, leaving almost nothing behind." (<i><a href="/wiki/Cf." title="Cf.">cf.</a></i> <a href="/wiki/James_Hansen#Proposed_solutions" title="James Hansen">similar comments by James Hansen</a>)</p>
<p>In 2012, Monbiot claimed that there was more than enough oil for "industry and consumer capitalism" to "deep-fry the lot of us" (citing a report of 110 million <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_barrel" title="Oil barrel">barrels</a> per day in 2020.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Debate_with_Ian_Plimer">Debate with Ian Plimer</span></h4>
<p>Monbiot harshly criticised the book <i><a href="/wiki/Heaven_and_Earth_(book)" title="Heaven and Earth (book)">Heaven and Earth</a></i> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_change_skeptic" title="Climate change skeptic">climate change skeptic</a> <a href="/wiki/Ian_Plimer" title="Ian Plimer">Ian Plimer</a>, saying that "Since its publication in Australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors, and its fudging and manipulation of the data". Plimer challenged Monbiot to a public debate on the issues covered in the book. Monbiot agreed on the condition that Plimer first answer a series of written questions for publication on the website of <i>The Guardian</i>, so there would be a factual basis to the discussion. Plimer refused and Monbiot labeled Plimer a "grandstander" with a "broad yellow streak" who has nowhere answered the accusations of serious errors in his <i>Heaven and Earth</i> book, and accused him of trying to "drown out the precise refutations published by his book's reviewers". Plimer then reversed his decision, and agreed to answer written questions in return for a live debate. Monbiot's response on receiving Plimer's contribution was one of disappointment, on the grounds that Plimer's response "so far consists not of answers, but of questions addressed to me." Monbiot told Plimer that he is not qualified to answer Plimer's questions (although <a href="/wiki/Gavin_Schmidt" title="Gavin Schmidt">Gavin Schmidt</a> of <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> did answer them). On 2 September 2009, Monbiot published another column in <i>The Guardian</i> asking: "Is Ian Plimer ever going to answer my questions?" and suggested that Plimer was evading the questions by using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chewbacca_defence" title="Chewbacca defence">Chewbacca defence</a>. A debate was subsequently held on 15 December, while Monbiot was in Copenhagen, on the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Lateline" title="Lateline">Lateline</a></i> programme, moderated by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Jones_(news_journalist)" title="Tony Jones (news journalist)">Tony Jones</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Attempted_arrest_of_John_Bolton">Attempted arrest of John Bolton</span></h3>
<p>Monbiot made an unsuccessful attempt to carry out a <a href="/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest" title="Citizen's arrest">citizen's arrest</a> of <a href="/wiki/John_R._Bolton" title="John R. Bolton">John Bolton</a>, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, when the latter attended the <a href="/wiki/Hay_Festival" title="Hay Festival">Hay Festival</a> to give a talk on international relations in May 2008. Monbiot argued that Bolton was one of the instigators of the Iraq War, of which Monbiot was an opponent.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_parties">Political parties</span></h3>
<p>He was involved initially with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RESPECT_The_Unity_Coalition" title="RESPECT The Unity Coalition">Respect</a> political party, but he broke with the organisation when it chose to run candidates against the <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales" title="Green Party of England and Wales">Green Party</a> in the 2004 election to the European Parliament. In an interview with the British political blog <i>Third Estate</i> in September 2009, Monbiot expressed his support for the policies of <a href="/wiki/Plaid_Cymru" title="Plaid Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a>, saying "I have finally found the party that I feel very comfortable with. That’s not to say I feel uncomfortable with the Green Party, on the whole I support it, but I feel even more comfortable with Plaid."</p>
<p>In April 2010, he was a signatory to an open letter of support for the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, published in <i>The Guardian</i>. Prior to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015" title="United Kingdom general election, 2015">2015 UK general election</a>, he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales" title="Green Party of England and Wales">Green Party</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Caroline_Lucas" title="Caroline Lucas">Caroline Lucas</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Indigenous_rights">Indigenous rights</span></h3>
<p>Monbiot has been associated with the cause of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_rights" title="Indigenous rights">indigenous rights</a>, and has sought to denounce threats to tribal people, at the face of corporate interests. He contributed to the 2009 book <i>We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples</i>, which explores the culture of peoples around the world, portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Published_works">Published works</span></h2>
<p>Monbiot's first book was <i><a href="/wiki/Poisoned_Arrows:_An_investigative_journey_through_the_forbidden_lands_of_West_Papua" title="Poisoned Arrows: An investigative journey through the forbidden lands of West Papua">Poisoned Arrows</a></i> (1989), a work of investigative travel journalism exposing what he called the "devastating effects" of the partially <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>-funded <a href="/wiki/Transmigration_program" title="Transmigration program">transmigration program</a> on the peoples and tribes of <a href="/wiki/Papua_(province)" title="Papua (province)">Papua</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Papua_(province)" title="West Papua (province)">West Papua</a> in <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. It was followed by <i><a href="/wiki/Amazon_Watershed" title="Amazon Watershed">Amazon Watershed</a></i> (1991) which documented expulsions of Brazilian peasant farmers from their land and followed them thousands of miles across the forest to the territory of the <a href="/wiki/Yanomami" title="Yanomami">Yanomami</a> Indians, and showed how timber sold in Britain was being stolen from indigenous and biological reserves in <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. His third book, <i><a href="/wiki/No_Man%27s_Land:_An_Investigative_Journey_Through_Kenya_and_Tanzania" title="No Man's Land: An Investigative Journey Through Kenya and Tanzania">No Man's Land: An Investigative Journey Through Kenya and Tanzania</a></i> (1994), documented the seizure of land and cattle from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nomadic_people" title="Nomadic people">nomadic people</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Republic_of_Tanzania" title="United Republic of Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, by—among other forces—game parks and safari tourism.</p>
<p>In 2000, he published <i>Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain</i>. The book examines the role of corporate power in the United Kingdom, on both local and national levels, and argues that corporate involvement in politics is a serious threat to democracy. Subjects discussed in the book include the building of the <a href="/wiki/Skye_Bridge" title="Skye Bridge">Skye Bridge</a>, corporate involvement in the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service" title="National Health Service">National Health Service</a>, the role of business in university research, and the conditions which influence the granting of <a href="/wiki/Planning_permission" title="Planning permission">planning permission</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Age_of_Consent"><i>The Age of Consent</i></span></h3>
<p>His fifth book, <i>The Age of Consent: A Manifesto for a New World Order</i>, was published in 2003. The book is an attempt to set out a positive manifesto for change for the <a href="/wiki/Global_justice_movement" title="Global justice movement">global justice movement</a>. Monbiot criticises <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, arguing that any possible solution to the world's inequalities must be rooted in a democratic parliamentary system. The four main changes to <a href="/wiki/Global_governance" title="Global governance">global governance</a> which Monbiot argues for are a democratically elected <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly" title="United Nations Parliamentary Assembly">world parliament</a> which would pass resolutions on international issues; a democratised <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> to replace the unelected <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Security_Council" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a>; the proposed <a href="/wiki/International_Clearing_Union" title="International Clearing Union">International Clearing Union</a> which would automatically discharge <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trade_deficits" title="Trade deficits">trade deficits</a> and prevent the accumulation of debt; and a <a href="/wiki/Fair_trade" title="Fair trade">fair trade</a> organisation which would regulate <a href="/wiki/International_trade" title="International trade">world trade</a> in a way that protects the economies of poorer countries.</p>
<p>The book also discusses ways in which these ideas may be put into practice. He posits that the United States and Western European states are heavily dependent on the existence of this debt, and that when faced with a choice between releasing the developing world from debt and the collapse of the global economy, their internal economic interests will dictate that they opt for the "soft landing" option. However, Monbiot emphasises that he does not present the manifesto as a "final or definitive" answer to global inequalities but intends that it should open debate and stresses that those who reject it must offer their own solutions. He argues that ultimately the global justice movement "must seek...to provide a coherent programme of alternatives to the concentrated power of the dictatorship of vested interests."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat"><i>Heat</i></span></h3>
<p>Monbiot's next book, <i>Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning</i>, published in 2006, focuses on the issue of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. He points out that the public opinion campaign to cast doubt on the reality of climate change is funded by fossil-fuel companies (primarily <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exxon-Mobil" title="Exxon-Mobil">Exxon-Mobil</a>), and traces the "network of fake citizens' groups and bogus scientific bodies" campaigning to discredit climate science to origins in a campaign by tobacco companies to create a facade of science to cast doubt on the link between cigarette smoking and disease. He argues that a 90 percent reduction in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emissions" title="Carbon emissions">carbon emissions</a> is necessary in developed countries in order to prevent disastrous changes to the climate. He then sets out to demonstrate how such a reduction could be achieved within the United Kingdom, without a significant fall in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Living_standards" title="Living standards">living standards</a>, through changes in housing, power supply, and transport.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feral"><i>Feral</i></span></h3>
<p><i>Feral: Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers of Rewilding</i> was published in 2013, and focuses on the concept of <a href="/wiki/Rewilding_(conservation_biology)" title="Rewilding (conservation biology)">rewilding</a> the planet. Monbiot states "rewilding offers a positive environmentalism. Environmentalists have long known what they are against; now we can explain what we are for."</p>
<p>In the book, Monbiot attacks <a href="/wiki/Sheep_farming" title="Sheep farming">sheep farming</a> as "a slow-burning ecological disaster, which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution.
