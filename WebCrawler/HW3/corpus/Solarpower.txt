<p>A <a href="/wiki/Solar_cell" title="Solar cell">solar cell</a>, or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_effect" title="Photovoltaic effect">photovoltaic effect</a>. The first solar cell was constructed by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Fritts" title="Charles Fritts">Charles Fritts</a> in the 1880s. The German industrialist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ernst_Werner_von_Siemens" title="Ernst Werner von Siemens">Ernst Werner von Siemens</a> was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silver_selenide" title="Silver selenide">silver selenide</a> in place of <a href="/wiki/Copper_oxide" title="Copper oxide">copper oxide</a>, although the prototype <a href="/wiki/Selenium" title="Selenium">selenium</a> cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Conventional_PV_systems">Conventional PV systems</span></h4>
<p>The array of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_system" title="Photovoltaic power system">photovoltaic power system</a>, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), through the use of <a href="/wiki/Solar_inverter" title="Solar inverter">inverters</a>. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.</p>
<p>Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets. In these <a href="/wiki/Grid-connected_photovoltaic_power_system" title="Grid-connected photovoltaic power system">grid-connected PV systems</a>, use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power" title="Concentrated solar power">Concentrated solar power</a></div>

<p>Concentrated solar power (CSP), also called "concentrated solar thermal", uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Contrary to photovoltaics – which converts light directly into electricity – CSP uses the heat of the sun's radiation to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines.</p>
<p>A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: among the best known are the <a href="/wiki/Parabolic_trough" title="Parabolic trough">parabolic trough</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Compact_linear_Fresnel_reflector" title="Compact linear Fresnel reflector">compact linear Fresnel reflector</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy#Dish_designs" title="Solar thermal energy">Stirling dish</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_tower" title="Solar power tower">solar power tower</a>. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a <a href="/wiki/Working_fluid" title="Working fluid">working fluid</a> is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.</p>
<p>A <i>parabolic trough</i> consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above the middle of the parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The <a href="/wiki/Solar_Energy_Generating_Systems" title="Solar Energy Generating Systems">SEGS</a> plants in California and Acciona's <a href="/wiki/Nevada_Solar_One" title="Nevada Solar One">Nevada Solar One</a> near <a href="/wiki/Boulder_City,_Nevada" title="Boulder City, Nevada">Boulder City, Nevada</a> are representatives of this technology.</p>
<p><i>Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors</i> are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.</p>
<p>The <i>Stirling solar dish</i> combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a <a href="/wiki/Stirling_engine" title="Stirling engine">Stirling engine</a> which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime. Parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies. The 50 kW <a href="/wiki/The_Big_Dish_(solar_thermal)" title="The Big Dish (solar thermal)">Big Dish</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canberra" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, Australia is an example of this technology.</p>
<p>A <i>solar power tower</i> uses an array of tracking reflectors (<a href="/wiki/Heliostat" title="Heliostat">heliostats</a>) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_days">Early days</span></h3>
<p>The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>. In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems. The <a href="/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" title="1973 oil crisis">1973 oil embargo</a> and <a href="/wiki/1979_energy_crisis" title="1979 energy crisis">1979 energy crisis</a> caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NREL" title="NREL">NREL</a>), Japan (<a href="/wiki/New_Energy_and_Industrial_Technology_Development_Organization" title="New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization">NEDO</a>), and Germany (<a href="/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society" title="Fraunhofer Society">Fraunhofer–ISE</a>). Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the <a href="/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics" title="Growth of photovoltaics">growth of photovoltaics</a> from 1984 to 1996.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mid-1990s_to_early_2010s">Mid-1990s to early 2010s</span></h3>

In the early 2000s, the adoption of <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariffs</a>—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.</p>

<p>Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40% per year since 2000 and total installed capacity reached 139 GW at the end of 2013 with <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Germany" title="Solar power in Germany">Germany</a> having the most cumulative installations (35.7 GW) and <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Italy" title="Solar power in Italy">Italy</a> having the highest percentage of electricity generated by solar PV (7.0%).</p>
<p>Concentrated solar power (CSP) also started to grow rapidly, increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar PV.

Four years later, in 2014, the agency projected that, under its "high renewables" scenario, solar power could supply 27% of global electricity generation by 2050 (16% from PV and 11% from CSP). In 2015, analysts predicted that one million homes in the U.S. will have solar power by the end of 2016.</p>

<p>Commercial concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, also called "solar thermal power stations", were first developed in the 1980s. The 377 MW <a href="/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility" title="Ivanpah Solar Power Facility">Ivanpah Solar Power Facility</a>, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world’s largest solar thermal power plant project. Other large CSP plants include the <a href="/wiki/Solnova_Solar_Power_Station" title="Solnova Solar Power Station">Solnova Solar Power Station</a> (150 MW), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Andasol_solar_power_station" title="Andasol solar power station">Andasol solar power station</a> (150 MW), and <a href="/wiki/Extresol_Solar_Power_Station" title="Extresol Solar Power Station">Extresol Solar Power Station</a> (150 MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5 pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5 hours of thermal storage.</p>


<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost">Cost</span></h3>

<p>Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palo_Alto" title="Palo Alto">Palo Alto</a> California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. And in sunny <a href="/wiki/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt-hour -- "competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity — and cheaper than most."</p>
<p>Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity. Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariff programs</a>. Also, <a href="/wiki/Renewable_portfolio_standard" title="Renewable portfolio standard">Renewable portfolio standards</a> impose a government mandate that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a>, ocean, geothermal, <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a>, hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Levelized_cost_of_electricity">Levelized cost of electricity</span></h4>
<p>The PV industry is beginning to adopt <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Levelized_cost_of_electricity" title="Levelized cost of electricity">levelized cost of electricity</a> (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatt-hour" title="Kilowatt-hour">kilowatt-hours</a> (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insolation" title="Insolation">insolation</a>, 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2 kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a <a href="/wiki/Capacity_factor" title="Capacity factor">capacity factor</a> of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Photovoltaic_Industry_Association" title="European Photovoltaic Industry Association">EPIA</a>, has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years. As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term <a href="/wiki/Power_purchase_agreement" title="Power purchase agreement">power purchase agreement</a>. Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90% by 2009.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Shi_Zhengrong" title="Shi Zhengrong">Shi Zhengrong</a> has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. He said "We are at a tipping point. No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich. They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies". "Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015".</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_installation_prices">Current installation prices</span></h4>
<p>In its 2014 edition of the <i>Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy</i> report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PV_system" title="PV system">PV systems</a> for eight major markets as of 2013 <i>(see table below)</i>. However, DOE's <a href="/wiki/SVTC_Technologies#The_SunShot_Initiative" title="SVTC Technologies">SunShot Initiative</a> has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100 kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grid_parity">Grid parity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Grid_parity" title="Grid parity">Grid parity</a></div>
<p>Grid parity, the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of <a href="/wiki/Mains_electricity" title="Mains electricity">grid power</a>, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of <a href="/wiki/Power_purchase_agreement" title="Power purchase agreement">power purchase agreements</a> (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grid_operator" title="Grid operator">grid operators</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_turbine_manufacturer" title="Wind turbine manufacturer">wind turbine manufacturers</a>.</p>
<p>Grid parity was first reached in <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> in 2013, <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and other islands that otherwise use <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> (<a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel fuel</a>) to produce electricity, and most of the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015.</p>
<p>In 2007, <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">General Electric</a>'s Chief Engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015; other companies predicted an earlier date: the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10% of commercial customers in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a>, as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Self_consumption">Self consumption</span></h3>
<p>In cases of self consumption of the solar energy, the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 Euro/KWh and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insolation" title="Insolation">insolation</a> of 900 KWh/KW, one KWp will save 225 Euro per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 Euro/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than 7 years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics.</p>

<p>The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate (), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificates" title="Solar Renewable Energy Certificates">Solar Renewable Energy Certificates</a> (SRECs)</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebates">Rebates</span></h4>
<p>With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as <a href="/wiki/Austin_Energy" title="Austin Energy">Austin Energy</a> in <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Net_metering">Net metering</span></h4>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Net_metering" title="Net metering">net metering</a> the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard <a href="/wiki/Electricity_meter" title="Electricity meter">electricity meters</a>, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Feed-in_tariffs_.28FIT.29">Feed-in tariffs (FIT)</span></h4>
<p>With <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariffs</a>, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.</p>
<p>The complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better. In some countries, additional incentives are offered for <a href="/wiki/Building-integrated_photovoltaics" title="Building-integrated photovoltaics">BIPV</a> compared to stand alone PV.</p>
<ul>
<li>France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)</li>
<li>Italy + EUR 0.04-0.09 kWh</li>
<li>Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Solar_Renewable_Energy_Credits_.28SRECs.29">Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)</span></h4>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificate" title="Solar Renewable Energy Certificate">SRECs</a> allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity. In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000 kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.</p>
<p>Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Australia" title="Solar power in Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_China" title="Solar power in China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Germany" title="Solar power in Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Israel" title="Solar power in Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Japan" title="Solar power in Japan">Japan</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_States" title="Solar power in the United States">United States</a> and even across states within the US.</p>
<p>The Japanese government through its <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry" title="Ministry of International Trade and Industry">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</a> ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">GW</a>.</p>
<p>In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Renewable_Energy_Act" title="German Renewable Energy Act">German Renewable Energy Act</a>, which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.</p>
<p>Subsequently, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Spain" title="Solar power in Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Italy" title="Solar power in Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Greece" title="Solar power in Greece">Greece</a>—that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs—and <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_France" title="Solar power in France">France</a> introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30-50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic "solar roof" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10 kW) has internal rates of return of 10-15% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax free.</p>
<p>In 2006 <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_California" title="Solar power in California">California</a> approved the '<a href="/wiki/California_Solar_Initiative" title="California Solar Initiative">California Solar Initiative</a>', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate "EPBB" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.</p>
<p>At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the <a href="/wiki/Green_Energy_Act_2009" title="Green Energy Act 2009">Green Energy Act</a>, and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10 MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impacts">Environmental impacts</span></h2>

<p>Unlike <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Greenhouse_gases">Greenhouse gases</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources" title="Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources">Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar power</a> are in the range of 22 to 46 gram (g) per <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilowatt-hour" title="Kilowatt-hour">kilowatt-hour</a> (kWh) depending on if solar thermal or solar PV is being analyzed, respectively. With this potentially being decreased to 15 g/kWh in the future. For comparison (of weighted averages), a <a href="/wiki/Combined_cycle" title="Combined cycle">combined cycle</a> gas-fired power plant emits some 400–599 g/kWh, an oil-fired power plant 893 g/kWh, a coal-fired power plant 915–994 g/kWh or with <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> some 200 g/kWh, and a <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal</a> high-temp. power plant 91–122 g/kWh. The life cycle emission intensity of <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wind" title="Wind">wind</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> are lower than solar's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article <a href="/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources" title="Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources">Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources</a>. Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_carbon_power" title="Low carbon power">low carbon power</a> in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex (one in Maryland, the other in Virginia) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly.</p>
<p>The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NREL" title="NREL">NREL</a>), in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions for solar PV, found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site: GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation. For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45 gCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh. Using the same assumptions, at Phoenix, USA, with insolation of 2400 kWh/m2/year, the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32 g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_Commissioner_for_the_Environment" title="Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment">Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment</a> found that the solar PV would have little impact on the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_payback">Energy payback</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Crystalline_silicon#Energy_payback_time" title="Crystalline silicon">energy payback time</a> (EPBT) of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system. Due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market. In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for <a href="/wiki/Crystalline_silicon" title="Crystalline silicon">crystalline silicon</a> silicon PV systems and 1–1.5 years for thin film technologies (S. Europe). These figures fell to 0.75–3.5 years in 2013, with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems.</p>
<p>Another economic measure, closely related to the energy payback time, is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EROEI" title="EROEI">energy returned on energy invested</a> (EROEI) or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EROEI" title="EROEI">energy return on investment</a> (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build <i>and maintain</i> the equipment. (This is not the same as the <a href="/wiki/Return_on_investment" title="Return on investment">economic return on investment</a> (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_system" title="Balance of system">balance of system</a> (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_issues">Other issues</span></h3>
<p>One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> (Cd), a <a href="/wiki/Toxic_heavy_metal" title="Toxic heavy metal">toxic heavy metal</a> that has the tendency to <a href="/wiki/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">accumulate</a> in ecological <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chains</a>. It is used as semiconductor component in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cadmium_telluride_solar_cell" title="Cadmium telluride solar cell">CdTe solar cells</a> and as buffer layer for certain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIGS_cell" title="CIGS cell">CIGS cells</a> in the form of <a href="/wiki/Cadmium_sulfide" title="Cadmium sulfide">CdS</a>. The amount of cadmium used in <a href="/wiki/Thin-film_solar_cell" title="Thin-film solar cell">thin-film PV modules</a> is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 <a href="/wiki/Microgram" title="Microgram">microgram</a>/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and <a href="/wiki/Lignite" title="Lignite">lignite</a> combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> 0.2 microgram/kWh.</p>
<p>In a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Life-cycle_analysis" title="Life-cycle analysis">life-cycle analysis</a> it has been noted, that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="/wiki/Crystalline_silicon" title="Crystalline silicon">crystalline silicon</a> modules, the <a href="/wiki/Solder" title="Solder">solder</a> material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a> (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy.</p>
<p>Some media sources have reported that concentrated solar power plants have injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat from the concentrated sunrays. This adverse effect does not apply to PV solar power plants, and some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated.</p>
<p>A 2014-published life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that the large-scale implementation of solar and wind potentially reduces pollution-related environmental impacts. The study found that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (ma/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility-scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18 ma/MWh.</p>

<p>Since solar energy is not available at night, <a href="/wiki/Energy_storage" title="Energy storage">storing its energy</a> is an important issue in order to have continuous energy availability. Both <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> and solar power are <a href="/wiki/Variable_renewable_energy" title="Variable renewable energy">variable renewable energy</a>, meaning that all available output must be taken when it is available, and either stored for <i>when it can be used later</i>, or transported over <a href="/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">transmission</a> lines to <i>where it can be used now</i>. <a href="/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power" title="Concentrated solar power">Concentrated solar power</a> plants may use <a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage" title="Thermal energy storage">thermal energy storage</a> to store the solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the <a href="/wiki/The_Solar_Project" title="The Solar Project">Solar Two</a> power station, allowing it to store 1.44 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Terajoules" title="Terajoules">TJ</a> in its 68 m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rechargeable_batteries" title="Rechargeable batteries">Rechargeable batteries</a> have been traditionally used to store excess electricity in <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_system#Standalone_system" title="Photovoltaic system">stand alone PV systems</a>. With <a href="/wiki/Grid-connected_photovoltaic_power_system" title="Grid-connected photovoltaic power system">grid-connected photovoltaic power system</a>, excess electricity can be sent to the <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">electrical grid</a>. <a href="/wiki/Net_metering" title="Net metering">Net metering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Feed-in_tariff" title="Feed-in tariff">feed-in tariff</a> programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. <a href="/wiki/Grid_energy_storage#Batteries" title="Grid energy storage">Batteries used for grid-storage</a> stabilize the <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">electrical grid</a> by <a href="/wiki/Grid_energy_storage#Load_leveling" title="Grid energy storage">leveling out peak loads</a> usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.</p>
<p>Although not permitted under the US National Electric Code, it is technically possible to have a “<a href="/wiki/Plug_and_play" title="Plug and play">plug and play</a>” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. </p>
<p>Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valve_regulated_lead-acid_battery" title="Valve regulated lead-acid battery">valve regulated lead-acid battery</a>– a modified version of the conventional <a href="/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery" title="Lead–acid battery">lead–acid battery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery" title="Nickel–cadmium battery">nickel–cadmium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery" title="Lithium-ion battery">lithium-ion</a> batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> provided by large production facilities such as the <a href="/wiki/Gigafactory_1" title="Gigafactory 1">Gigafactory 1</a>. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric cars</a> may serve as a future storage devices in a <a href="/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid" title="Vehicle-to-grid">vehicle-to-grid</a> system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Distributed_energy_storage_system" title="Distributed energy storage system">distributed</a> PV systems include, <a href="/wiki/Sodium%E2%80%93sulfur_battery" title="Sodium–sulfur battery">sodium–sulfur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vanadium_redox_battery" title="Vanadium redox battery">vanadium redox</a> batteries, two prominent types of a <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_battery" title="Molten salt battery">molten salt</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Flow_battery" title="Flow battery">flow</a> battery, respectively.</p>
<p>Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with variable electricity sources such as solar and wind, the water can be held back and allowed to flow as required. Where a suitable river is not available, <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage hydroelectricity</a> stores energy in the form of water pumped when surplus electricity is available, from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water through a hydroelectric power generator. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies.</p>
<p>The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such <a href="/wiki/Solar_hybrid_power_systems" title="Solar hybrid power systems">solar hybrid power systems</a> is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Kassel" title="University of Kassel">University of Kassel</a> pilot-tested a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_power_plant" title="Virtual power plant">combined power plant</a> linking solar, wind, <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">hydrostorage</a> to provide load-following power from renewable sources.</p>
<p>Research is also undertaken in this field of <a href="/wiki/Artificial_photosynthesis" title="Artificial photosynthesis">artificial photosynthesis</a>. It involves the use of <a href="/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as <a href="/wiki/Methanol" title="Methanol">methanol</a>. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions.
