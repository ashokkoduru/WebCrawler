<p><b>Water quality</b> refers to the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological characteristics of <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>. It is a measure of the condition of water relative to the requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or purpose. It is most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which compliance can be assessed. The most common standards used to assess water quality relate to health of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ecosystems" title="Ecosystems">ecosystems</a>, safety of human contact, and <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a>.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Standards">Standards</span></h2>
<p>In the setting of standards, agencies make political and technical/scientific decisions about how the water will be used. In the case of natural <a href="/wiki/Body_of_water" title="Body of water">water bodies</a>, they also make some reasonable estimate of pristine conditions. Different uses raise different concerns and therefore different standards are considered. Natural water bodies will vary in response to environmental conditions. <a href="/wiki/Environmental_science" title="Environmental science">Environmental scientists</a> work to understand how these systems function, which in turn helps to identify the sources and fates of contaminants. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_lawyers" title="Environmental lawyers">Environmental lawyers</a> and policymakers work to define legislation with the intention that water is maintained at an appropriate quality for its identified use.</p>
<p>The vast majority of <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a> on the planet is neither <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potable" title="Potable">potable</a> nor <a href="/wiki/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxic</a>. This remains true when <a href="/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">seawater</a> in the oceans (which is too salty to drink) is not counted. Another general perception of <i>water quality</i> is that of a simple property that tells whether water is <a href="/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">polluted</a> or not. In fact, water quality is a complex subject, in part because water is a complex medium intrinsically tied to the <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a> of the Earth. Industrial and commercial activities (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mining" title="Mining">mining</a>, <a href="/wiki/Construction" title="Construction">construction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">transport</a>) are a major cause of <a href="/wiki/Water_pollution" title="Water pollution">water pollution</a> as are <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" title="Surface runoff">runoff</a> from <a href="/wiki/Farm" title="Farm">agricultural</a> areas, <a href="/wiki/Urban_runoff" title="Urban runoff">urban runoff</a> and discharge of treated and untreated <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Categories">Categories</span></h2>
<p>The parameters for water quality are determined by the intended use. Work in the area of water quality tends to be focused on water that is treated for human consumption, industrial use, or in the environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_consumption">Human consumption</span></h3>
<p>Contaminants that may be in untreated water include <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a> such as viruses, protozoa and bacteria; inorganic contaminants such as <a href="/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)" title="Salt (chemistry)">salts</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metals" title="Metals">metals</a>; <a href="/wiki/Organic_chemistry" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemical</a> contaminants from industrial processes and <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> use; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herbicides" title="Herbicides">herbicides</a>; and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactive" title="Radioactive">radioactive</a> contaminants. Water quality depends on the local geology and ecosystem, as well as human uses such as sewage dispersion, industrial pollution, use of water bodies as a <a href="/wiki/Heat_sink" title="Heat sink">heat sink</a>, and overuse (which may lower the level of the water).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) limits the amounts of certain contaminants in <a href="/wiki/Tap_water" title="Tap water">tap water</a> provided by US public water systems. The <a href="/wiki/Safe_Drinking_Water_Act" title="Safe Drinking Water Act">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> authorizes EPA to issue two types of standards: <i>primary standards</i> regulate substances that potentially affect human health, and <i>secondary standards</i> prescribe aesthetic qualities, those that affect taste, odor, or appearance. The U.S. <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in <a href="/wiki/Bottled_water" title="Bottled water">bottled water</a> that must provide the same protection for public health. Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Urbanization" title="Urbanization">urbanized</a> areas around the world, <a href="/wiki/Water_purification" title="Water purification">water purification</a> technology is used in municipal water systems to remove contaminants from the source water (surface water or <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a>) before it is distributed to homes, businesses, schools and other recipients. Water drawn directly from a stream, lake, or <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> and that has no treatment will be of uncertain quality.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_and_domestic_use">Industrial and domestic use</span></h3>
<p>Dissolved minerals may affect suitability of water for a range of industrial and domestic purposes. The most familiar of these is probably the presence of ions of <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> which interfere with the cleaning action of <a href="/wiki/Soap" title="Soap">soap</a>, and can form hard <a href="/wiki/Sulfate" title="Sulfate">sulfate</a> and soft <a href="/wiki/Carbonate" title="Carbonate">carbonate</a> deposits in water heaters or <a href="/wiki/Boiler" title="Boiler">boilers</a>. Hard water may be softened to remove these ions. The softening process often substitutes <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> cations. Hard water may be preferable to soft water for human consumption, since health problems have been associated with excess sodium and with calcium and magnesium deficiencies. Softening decreases nutrition and may increase cleaning effectiveness.</p>

<p>Environmental water quality, also called <b>ambient water quality,</b> relates to water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. Water quality standards for surface waters vary significantly due to different environmental conditions, ecosystems, and intended human uses. Toxic substances and high populations of certain microorganisms can present a health hazard for non-drinking purposes such as irrigation, swimming, fishing, rafting, boating, and industrial uses. These conditions may also affect wildlife, which use the water for drinking or as a habitat. Modern water quality laws generally specify protection of fisheries and recreational use and require, as a minimum, retention of current quality standards.</p>

<p>There is some desire among the public to return water bodies to pristine, or pre-industrial conditions. Most current environmental laws focus on the designation of particular uses of a water body. In some countries these designations allow for some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_contamination" title="Water contamination">water contamination</a> as long as the particular type of contamination is not harmful to the designated uses. Given the landscape changes (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Land_development" title="Land development">land development</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urbanization" title="Urbanization">urbanization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clearcutting" title="Clearcutting">clearcutting</a> in forested areas) in the <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">watersheds</a> of many freshwater bodies, returning to pristine conditions would be a significant challenge. In these cases, environmental scientists focus on achieving goals for maintaining healthy ecosystems and may concentrate on the protection of populations of <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered species</a> and protecting human health.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sampling_and_measurement">Sampling and measurement</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_chemistry_analysis" title="Water chemistry analysis">water chemistry analysis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Analytical_chemistry" title="Analytical chemistry">analytical chemistry</a></div>
<p>The complexity of water quality as a subject is reflected in the many types of measurements of water quality indicators. The most accurate measurements of water quality are made on-site, because water exists in equilibrium with its surroundings. Measurements commonly made on-site and in direct contact with the water source in question include temperature, <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dissolved_oxygen" title="Dissolved oxygen">dissolved oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Conductivity_(electrolytic)" title="Conductivity (electrolytic)">conductivity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reduction_potential" title="Reduction potential">oxygen reduction potential (ORP)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turbidity" title="Turbidity">turbidity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Secchi_disk" title="Secchi disk">Secchi disk</a> depth.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sample_collection">Sample collection</span></h3>

<p>More complex measurements are often made in a <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> requiring a water sample to be collected, preserved, transported, and analyzed at another location. The process of water sampling introduces two significant problems. The first problem is the extent to which the sample may be representative of the water source of interest. Many water sources vary with time and with location. The measurement of interest may vary seasonally or from day to night or in response to some activity of man or natural populations of aquatic plants and animals. The measurement of interest may vary with distances from the water boundary with overlying <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" title="Atmosphere of Earth">atmosphere</a> and underlying or confining <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a>. The sampler must determine if a single time and location meets the needs of the investigation, or if the water use of interest can be satisfactorily assessed by <a href="/wiki/Average" title="Average">averaged</a> values with time and/or location, or if critical <a href="/wiki/Maxima_and_minima" title="Maxima and minima">maxima and minima</a> require individual measurements over a range of times, locations and/or events. The sample collection procedure must assure correct weighting of individual sampling times and locations where averaging is appropriate. Where critical maximum or minimum values exist, <a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistical methods</a> must be applied to observed variation to determine an adequate number of samples to assess <a href="/wiki/Probability" title="Probability">probability</a> of exceeding those critical values.</p>
<p>The second problem occurs as the sample is removed from the water source and begins to establish <a href="/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium" title="Chemical equilibrium">chemical equilibrium</a> with its new surroundings - the sample container. Sample containers must be made of materials with minimal reactivity with substances to be measured; and pre-cleaning of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may <a href="/wiki/Sorption" title="Sorption">sorb</a> onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis. Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any pumps, piping, or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced <a href="/wiki/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a> of the atmosphere; so gas <a href="/wiki/Solvation" title="Solvation">dissolved</a> in the water may escape into unfilled space at the top of the container. Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other chemical reaction equilibria may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly <a href="/wiki/Suspended_solids" title="Suspended solids">suspended</a> by water turbulence may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid phase may form from biological growth or <a href="/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)" title="Precipitation (chemistry)">chemical precipitation</a>. <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">Microorganisms</a> within the water sample may biochemically alter concentrations of <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic compounds</a>. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> and change solubility of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.</p>

<p>Sample preservation may partially resolve the second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold to slow the <a href="/wiki/Reaction_rate" title="Reaction rate">rate of chemical reactions</a> and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them. A useful procedure for determining influence of sample containers during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples in advance of the sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a "blank," is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest. The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then "spiked" with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank and spiked samples are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Testing_in_response_to_natural_disasters_and_other_emergencies">Testing in response to natural disasters and other emergencies</span></h3>
<p>Inevitably after events such as earthquakes and tsunamis, there is an immediate response by the aid agencies as relief operations get underway to try and restore basic infrastructure and provide the basic fundamental items that are necessary for survival and subsequent recovery. Access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation is a priority at times like this. The threat of disease increases hugely due to the large numbers of people living close together, often in squalid conditions, and without proper sanitation.</p>
<p>After a natural disaster, as far as water quality testing is concerned there are widespread views on the best course of action to take and a variety of methods can be employed. The key basic water quality parameters that need to be addressed in an emergency are bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, free <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> residual, pH, turbidity and possibly conductivity/total dissolved solids. There are a number of portable water test kits on the market widely used by aid and relief agencies for carrying out such testing.</p>
<p>After major natural disasters, a considerable length of time might pass before water quality returns to pre-disaster levels. For example, following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_Tsunami" title="2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami">2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami</a> the Colombo-based <a href="/wiki/International_Water_Management_Institute" title="International Water Management Institute">International Water Management Institute</a> (IWMI) monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event. IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_analysis">Chemical analysis</span></h3>

<p>The simplest methods of chemical analysis are those measuring <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> without respect to their form. Elemental analysis for <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890,000 milligrams per litre (mg/L) of water sample because water is made of oxygen. The method selected to measure <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dissolved_oxygen" title="Dissolved oxygen">dissolved oxygen</a> should differentiate between <a href="/wiki/Diatomic_molecule" title="Diatomic molecule">diatomic</a> oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements. The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced a large amount of sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)" title="Heavy metal (chemistry)">heavy metals</a>. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal. Although the particles are not <a href="/wiki/Solvation" title="Solvation">dissolved</a> in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water. Adding <a href="/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acid</a> to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil particles. <a href="/wiki/Filtration" title="Filtration">Filtration</a> of soil particles from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter. The complexities of differentiating similar <a href="/wiki/Organic_chemistry" title="Organic chemistry">organic molecules</a> are even more challenging.</p>

<p>Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted by government agencies. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment. Tools available to the general public include on-site test kits, commonly used for home fish tanks, and biological assessment procedures.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Real-time_monitoring">Real-time monitoring</span></h3>
<p>Although water quality is usually sampled and analyzed at laboratories, nowadays, citizens demand real-time information about the water they are drinking. During the last years, several companies are deploying worldwide real-time remote monitoring systems for measuring water pH, turbidity or dissolved oxygen levels.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_indicator" title="Biological indicator">Biological monitoring</a> metrics have been developed in many places, and one widely used measure is the presence and abundance of members of the insect orders <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ephemeroptera" title="Ephemeroptera">Ephemeroptera</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plecoptera" title="Plecoptera">Plecoptera</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trichoptera" title="Trichoptera">Trichoptera</a>. (Common names are, respectively, Mayfly, Stonefly and Caddisfly.) EPT indexes will naturally vary from region to region, but generally, within a region, the greater the number of taxa from these orders, the better the water quality. Organisations in the United States, such as EPA offer guidance on developing a monitoring program and identifying members of these and other aquatic insect orders.</p>
<p>Individuals interested in monitoring water quality who cannot afford or manage lab scale analysis can also use biological indicators to get a general reading of water quality. One example is the IOWATER volunteer water monitoring program, which includes a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Benthic" title="Benthic">benthic</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macroinvertebrate" title="Macroinvertebrate">macroinvertebrate</a> indicator key.</p>
<p>Bivalve molluscs are largely used as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioindicators" title="Bioindicators">bioindicators</a> to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem.

<p>In the United States, <a href="/wiki/Clean_Water_Act#Water_Quality_Standards_Program" title="Clean Water Act">Water Quality Standards</a> are defined by state agencies for various water bodies, guided by the desired uses for the water body (e.g., fish habitat, drinking water supply, recreational use). The <a href="/wiki/Clean_Water_Act" title="Clean Water Act">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) requires each governing jurisdiction (states, territories, and covered tribal entities) to submit a set of biennial reports on the quality of water in their area. These reports are known as the 303(d) and 305(b) reports, named for their respective CWA provisions, and are submitted to, and approved by, EPA. These reports are completed by the governing jurisdiction, typically a <a href="/wiki/Category:State_environmental_protection_agencies_of_the_United_States" title="Category:State environmental protection agencies of the United States">state environmental agency</a>. EPA recommends that each state submit a single "Integrated Report" comprising its list of impaired waters and the status of all water bodies in the state. The <i>National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress</i> is a general report on water quality, providing overall information about the number of miles of streams and rivers and their aggregate condition. The CWA requires states to adopt standards for each of the possible designated uses that they assign to their waters. Should evidence suggest or document that a stream, river or lake has failed to meet the water quality criteria for one or more of its designated uses, it is placed on a list of impaired waters. Once a state has placed a water body on this list, it must develop a management plan establishing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Total_Maximum_Daily_Load" title="Total Maximum Daily Load">Total Maximum Daily Loads</a> (TMDLs) for the pollutant(s) impairing the use of the water. These TMDLs establish the reductions needed to fully support the designated uses.</p>
