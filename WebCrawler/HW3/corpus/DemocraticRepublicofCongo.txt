<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is extremely rich in natural resources, but political instability, a lack of infrastructure, deep rooted corruption, and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation have limited holistic development.

<p>The area now known as the DR Congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the <a href="/wiki/Semliki_harpoon" title="Semliki harpoon">Semliki harpoon</a> at Katanda, one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.</p>
<p>Some historians think that <a href="/wiki/Bantu_peoples" title="Bantu peoples">Bantu peoples</a> began settling in the extreme northwest of Central Africa at the beginning of the 5th century and then gradually started to expand southward. Their propagation was accelerated by the transition from <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> to <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> techniques. The people living in the south and southwest were mostly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bushmen" title="Bushmen">San Bushmen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies.

<p>The 10th century marked the <a href="/wiki/Bantu_expansion" title="Bantu expansion">final expansion of the Bantu</a> in West-Central Africa. Rising populations soon made possible intricate local, regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in salt, iron and copper.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Belgian_Congo" title="Belgian Congo">Belgian exploration</a> and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sir_Henry_Morton_Stanley" title="Sir Henry Morton Stanley">Sir Henry Morton Stanley</a>, who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/King_Leopold_II_of_Belgium" title="King Leopold II of Belgium">King Leopold II of Belgium</a>. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant <a href="/wiki/Slave_raiding" title="Slave raiding">slave raiding</a>, mainly from Arab–Swahili <a href="/wiki/Arab_slave_trade" title="Arab slave trade">slave traders</a> such as the infamous <a href="/wiki/Tippu_Tip" title="Tippu Tip">Tippu Tip</a>, who was well known to Stanley. Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony. In a succession of negotiations, Leopold, professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Front_organization" title="Front organization">front organization</a> <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Association_Internationale_Africaine" title="Association Internationale Africaine">Association Internationale Africaine</a></i>, actually played one European rival against another.</p>
<p>Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conference_of_Berlin" title="Conference of Berlin">Conference of Berlin</a> in 1885 and made the land his private property. He named it the Congo Free State. Leopold's rėgime began various infrastructure projects, such as construction of the <a href="/wiki/Matadi%E2%80%93Kinshasa_Railway" title="Matadi–Kinshasa Railway">railway that ran from the coast to the capital</a> of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), which took eight years to complete. Nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which Leopold and his associates could extract from the colony.</p>
<p>In the Free State, colonists brutalized the local population into producing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rubber" title="Rubber">rubber</a>, for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market. Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ostend" title="Ostend">Ostend</a> to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the army, the <i><a href="/wiki/Force_Publique" title="Force Publique">Force Publique</a></i>, was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy.</p>
<p>During the period of 1885–1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically – it has been estimated that <a href="/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis" title="African trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a> and <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower <a href="/wiki/Congo_River" title="Congo River">Congo River</a>. A government commission later concluded that the population of the Congo had been "reduced by half" during this period, but determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Congo" title="Belgian Congo">Belgian Congo</a></div>
<p>In 1908, the Belgian parliament, despite initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure, especially from the United Kingdom, and took over the Free State from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/King_Leopold_II" title="King Leopold II">King Leopold II</a>. On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. Executive power rested with the Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in Brussels) and the Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo. In 1926, the colonial capital moved from Boma to Léopoldville, some 300 km further upstream into the interior.</p>
<p>The transition from the Congo Free State to the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Congo" title="Belgian Congo">Belgian Congo</a> was a break but it was also marked by a large degree of continuity. The last Governor-general of the Congo Free State, Baron Wahis, remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold II’s administration with him. Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches for the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion – however, other priorities, such as healthcare and basic education, slowly gained in importance.</p>

<p>Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed (a system of European courts and one of indigenous courts, <i>tribunaux indigènes</i>). Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. In 1936 it was recorded that there were 728 Belgian administrators controlling the Colony. No political activity was permitted in the Congo whatsoever and the <i><a href="/wiki/Force_Publique" title="Force Publique">Force Publique</a></i>, a locally-recruited army under Belgian command, put down any attempts at rebellion.</p>
<p>The Belgian population of the colony increased from 1,928 in 1910 to nearly 89,000 in 1959.</p>
<p>The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, an initial stand-off between the <i>Force Publique</i> and the German colonial army in German East Africa (Tanganyika) turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the <a href="/wiki/East_African_Campaign_(World_War_I)" title="East African Campaign (World War I)">East African Campaign</a>. The <i>Force Publique</i> gained a notable victory when it marched into <a href="/wiki/Tabora" title="Tabora">Tabora</a> in September 1916, under the command of General <a href="/wiki/Charles_Tombeur" title="Charles Tombeur">Charles Tombeur</a> after heavy fighting.</p>
<p>After the war, Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the <i>Force Publique</i> in the East African campaign with a <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> mandate over the previously German colony of Ruanda-Urundi. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the Belgian Congo was a crucial source of income for the Belgian government in exile in London, and the <i>Force Publique</i> again participated in Allied campaigns in Africa.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Congo_Crisis" title="Congo Crisis">Congo Crisis</a></div>

<p>In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the <a href="/wiki/Mouvement_National_Congolais" title="Mouvement National Congolais">Mouvement National Congolais</a> or MNC Party, led by <a href="/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba" title="Patrice Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>, won the parliamentary elections. Patrice Lumumba thus became the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The parliament elected as President <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Kasavubu" title="Joseph Kasavubu">Joseph Kasavubu</a>, of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the <a href="/wiki/Parti_Solidaire_Africain" title="Parti Solidaire Africain">Parti Solidaire Africain</a> (or PSA) led by <a href="/wiki/Antoine_Gizenga" title="Antoine Gizenga">Antoine Gizenga</a>, and the Parti National du Peuple (or PNP) led by Albert Delvaux and <a href="/wiki/Laurent_Mbariko" title="Laurent Mbariko">Laurent Mbariko</a>. (Congo 1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium).</p>
<p>The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name "République du Congo" ("Republic of Congo" or "Republic of the Congo" in English). Shortly after independence, the provinces of <a href="/wiki/Katanga_Province" title="Katanga Province">Katanga</a> (led by <a href="/wiki/Moise_Tshombe" title="Moise Tshombe">Moise Tshombe</a>) and <a href="/wiki/South_Kasai" title="South Kasai">South Kasai</a> engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership. Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country, opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite.</p>
<p>As the neighboring French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name "Republic of Congo" upon achieving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as "Congo-Léopoldville" and "Congo-Brazzaville", after their capital cities.</p>
<p>On 5 September 1960, Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba from office. Lumumba declared Kasavubu's action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed. (cf. <i>Sécession au Katanga</i> – J.Gerald-Libois -Brussels- CRISP)</p>
<p>On 14 September, Lumumba was arrested by forces loyal to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Mobutu" title="Joseph Mobutu">Joseph Mobutu</a>. On 17 January 1961, he was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by Belgian-led Katangese troops. Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (Collège des Commissaires) with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Evariste_Kimba" title="Evariste Kimba">Evariste Kimba</a>. The Katanga secession was ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments, of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Ileo" title="Joseph Ileo">Joseph Ileo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cyrille_Adoula" title="Cyrille Adoula">Cyrille Adoula</a> and Moise Tshombe, took over in quick succession.</p>
<p>Lumumba had previously appointed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joseph_Mobutu" title="Joseph Mobutu">Joseph Mobutu</a> chief of staff of the new Congo army, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Military_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Congo" title="Military of the Democratic Republic of Congo">Armée Nationale Congolaise</a> (ANC). Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Lumumba, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create mutiny. With financial support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu paid his soldiers privately. The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutu's quest to neutralize Kasavubu and Lumumba in a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup</a> by proxy. A <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo_(L%C3%A9opoldville)_constitutional_referendum,_1964" title="Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) constitutional referendum, 1964">constitutional referendum</a> after Mobutu's coup of 1965 resulted in the country's official name being changed to the "Democratic Republic of the Congo." In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again, this time to "Republic of Zaire".</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Zaire" title="Zaire">Zaire</a></div>

<p>The new president had the support of the United States because of his staunch <a href="/wiki/Anti-communism" title="Anti-communism">opposition</a> to Communism, believing that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa. A one-party system was established, and Mobutu declared himself head of state. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe human rights violations, political repression, a <a href="/wiki/Cult_of_personality" title="Cult of personality">cult of personality</a> and corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption became so prevalent the term "le mal Zairois" or "Zairean Sickness", meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu himself. International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a "<a href="/wiki/Kleptocracy" title="Kleptocracy">kleptocracy</a>" as Mobutu and his associates <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" title="Embezzlement">embezzled</a> government funds.</p>
<p>In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became <a href="/wiki/Kinshasa" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> [the country was now Democratic Republic of The Congo – Kinshasa], Stanleyville became <a href="/wiki/Kisangani" title="Kisangani">Kisangani</a>, Elisabethville became <a href="/wiki/Lubumbashi" title="Lubumbashi">Lubumbashi</a>, and Coquilhatville became <a href="/wiki/Mbandaka" title="Mbandaka">Mbandaka</a>. This renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the <i>Republic of Zaire</i>, its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, he was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" title="George H.

Following the <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Dissolution of the Soviet Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a> U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee Zaire, in 1997.</p>

They allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu, and ultimately to control the mineral resources of Zaire, launching the <a href="/wiki/First_Congo_War" title="First Congo War">First Congo War</a>. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by <a href="/wiki/Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Kabila" title="Laurent-Désiré Kabila">Laurent-Désiré Kabila</a>, becoming the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_of_Democratic_Forces_for_the_Liberation_of_Congo" title="Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo">Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo</a> (AFDL). In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries—he had concerns that the Rwandan officers running his army were plotting a coup to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report directly to the Rwandan president, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Kagame" title="Paul Kagame">Paul Kagame</a>.

MONUC took control of the city. A new election took place in October 2006, which Kabila won, and on December 2006 he was sworn in as President.</p>

<p>However, <a href="/wiki/Laurent_Nkunda" title="Laurent Nkunda">Laurent Nkunda</a>, a member of an RCD branch integrated to the army, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RCD-Goma" title="RCD-Goma">RCD-Goma</a>, defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the <a href="/wiki/National_Congress_for_the_Defence_of_the_People" title="National Congress for the Defence of the People">National Congress for the Defence of the People</a> (CNDP), which began an armed rebellion against the government, starting the <a href="/wiki/Kivu_conflict" title="Kivu conflict">Kivu conflict</a>. They were believed to be again backed by Rwanda as a way to tackle the Hutu group, <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Forces_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda" title="Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda">Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda</a> (FDLR). In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members. In 2012 the leader of the CNDP, <a href="/wiki/Bosco_Ntaganda" title="Bosco Ntaganda">Bosco Ntaganda</a>, and troops loyal to him, mutinied and formed the rebel military <a href="/wiki/March_23_Movement" title="March 23 Movement">March 23 Movement</a>, claiming a violation of the treaty by the government.</p>
<p>In the resulting <a href="/wiki/M23_rebellion" title="M23 rebellion">M23 rebellion</a>, M23 briefly captured the provincial capital of <a href="/wiki/Goma" title="Goma">Goma</a> in November 2012. Neighboring countries, particularly Rwanda, have been accused of using rebels groups as proxies to gain control of the resource-rich country and of arming rebels, a claim they deny. In March 2013, the United Nations <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Security_Council" title="Security Council">Security Council</a> authorized the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Force_Intervention_Brigade" title="United Nations Force Intervention Brigade">United Nations Force Intervention Brigade</a>, the first offensive United Nations peacekeeping unit, to neutralize armed groups. On 5 November 2013, M23 declared an end to its insurgency.</p>

<p>Additionally, in northern <a href="/wiki/Katanga_Province" title="Katanga Province">Katanga</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mai-Mai" title="Mai-Mai">Mai-Mai</a> created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa with <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A9d%C3%A9on_Kyungu_Mutanga" title="Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga">Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mai_Mai_Kata_Katanga" title="Mai Mai Kata Katanga">Mai Mai Kata Katanga</a> briefly invading the provincial capital of <a href="/wiki/Lubumbashi" title="Lubumbashi">Lubumbashi</a> in 2013 and 400,000 persons displaced in the province as of 2013. On and off fighting in the <a href="/wiki/Ituri_conflict" title="Ituri conflict">Ituri conflict</a> occurred between the <a href="/wiki/Nationalist_and_Integrationist_Front" title="Nationalist and Integrationist Front">Nationalist and Integrationist Front</a> (FNI) and the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Congolese_Patriots" title="Union of Congolese Patriots">Union of Congolese Patriots</a> (UPC) who claimed to represent the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lendu" title="Lendu">Lendu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hema_people" title="Hema people">Hema</a> ethnic groups, respectively. In the northeast, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Kony" title="Joseph Kony">Joseph Kony</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LRA" title="LRA">LRA</a> moved from their original bases in Uganda and South Sudan to DR Congo in 2005 and set up camps in the Garamba National Park.</p>
<p>In 2009 people in the Congo continued to die at a rate of an estimated 45,000 per month – estimates of the number who have died from the long conflict range from 900,000 to 5,400,000. The death toll is due to widespread disease and famine; reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are children under five years of age. There have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians, of the destruction of property, of widespread sexual violence, causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, and of other breaches of humanitarian and human rights law. One study found that more than <a href="/wiki/Sexual_violence_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo">400,000 women are raped</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo every year.</p>
<p>In 2015 <a href="/wiki/2015_Congolese_protests" title="2015 Congolese protests">major protests</a> broke out across the country and protesters demanded that <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Kabila" title="Joseph Kabila">Joseph Kabila</a> step down as President. The protests began after the passage of a law by the Congolese lower house that, if also passed by the Congolese upper house, would keep Kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted (a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections, which he is constitutionally barred from participating in).</p>
<p>This bill passed; however, it was gutted of the provision that would keep Joseph Kabila in power until a census took place. A census is supposed to take place, but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place. As of 2015, elections are scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace holds over the Congo.</p>

<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is located in central <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, bounded by (clockwise from the southwest) <a href="/wiki/Angola" title="Angola">Angola</a>, the South Atlantic Ocean, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Republic_of_Congo" title="Republic of Congo">Republic of Congo</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Central_African_Republic" title="Central African Republic">Central African Republic</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Sudan" title="South Sudan">South Sudan</a>, Uganda, <a href="/wiki/Rwanda" title="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, Burundi, <a href="/wiki/Tanzania" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> across <a href="/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika" title="Lake Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Zambia" title="Zambia">Zambia</a>. The country lies between latitudes <a href="/wiki/6th_parallel_north" title="6th parallel north">6°N</a> and <a href="/wiki/14th_parallel_south" title="14th parallel south">14°S</a>, and longitudes <a href="/wiki/12th_meridian_east" title="12th meridian east">12°</a> and <a href="/wiki/32nd_meridian_east" title="32nd meridian east">32°E</a>. It straddles the <a href="/wiki/Equator" title="Equator">Equator</a>, with one-third to the North and two-thirds to the South. The size of Congo, 2,345,408 square kilometres (905,567 sq mi), is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway.</p>
<p>As a result of its equatorial location, the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of 2,000 millimetres (80 in) in some places, and the area sustains the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congo_Rainforest" title="Congo Rainforest">Congo Rainforest</a>, the second-largest rain forest in the world after the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_rainforest" title="Amazon rainforest">Amazon</a>. This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast, low-lying central <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">basin</a> of the river, which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by <a href="/wiki/Plateau" title="Plateau">plateaus</a> merging into <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannas</a> in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and dense <a href="/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grasslands</a> extending beyond the <a href="/wiki/Congo_River" title="Congo River">Congo River</a> in the north. High, glaciated mountains (<a href="/wiki/Rwenzori_Mountains" title="Rwenzori Mountains">Rwenzori Mountains</a>) are found in the extreme eastern region.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Tropical_climate" title="Tropical climate">tropical climate</a> also produced the <a href="/wiki/Congo_River" title="Congo River">Congo River</a> system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through, though they are not mutually exclusive. The name for the Congo state is derived in part from the river. The river basin (meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad tributaries) occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly 1,000,000 km (390,000 sq mi). The river and its tributaries form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation. Major tributaries include the <a href="/wiki/Kasai_River" title="Kasai River">Kasai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sangha_River" title="Sangha River">Sangha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ubangi_River" title="Ubangi River">Ubangi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ruzizi_River" title="Ruzizi River">Ruzizi</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aruwimi" title="Aruwimi">Aruwimi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lulonga_River" title="Lulonga River">Lulonga</a>.</p>

<p>The sources of the Congo are in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Albertine_Rift_Mountains" title="Albertine Rift Mountains">Albertine Rift Mountains</a> that flank the western branch of the <a href="/wiki/East_African_Rift" title="East African Rift">East African Rift</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika" title="Lake Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lake_Mweru" title="Lake Mweru">Lake Mweru</a>. The river flows generally west from <a href="/wiki/Kisangani" title="Kisangani">Kisangani</a> just below <a href="/wiki/Boyoma_Falls" title="Boyoma Falls">Boyoma Falls</a>, then gradually bends southwest, passing by <a href="/wiki/Mbandaka" title="Mbandaka">Mbandaka</a>, joining with the <a href="/wiki/Ubangi_River" title="Ubangi River">Ubangi River</a>, and running into the <a href="/wiki/Pool_Malebo" title="Pool Malebo">Pool Malebo</a> (Stanley Pool). <a href="/wiki/Kinshasa" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brazzaville" title="Brazzaville">Brazzaville</a> are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool (see NASA image). Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons, collectively known as the <a href="/wiki/Livingstone_Falls" title="Livingstone Falls">Livingstone Falls</a>, and runs past <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Boma,_Congo" title="Boma, Congo">Boma</a> into the Atlantic Ocean. The river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">watershed</a> of any river in the world (trailing the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon</a> in both respects). The river and a 37 km wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the country's only outlet to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Albertine_Rift" title="Albertine Rift">Albertine Rift</a> plays a key role in shaping the Congo's geography. Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but due to the rift's <a href="/wiki/Tectonics" title="Tectonics">tectonic</a> activity, this area also experiences <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volcanic" title="Volcanic">volcanic</a> activity, occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created the famous <a href="/wiki/African_Great_Lakes" title="African Great Lakes">African Great Lakes</a>, three of which lie on the Congo's eastern frontier: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lake_Albert_(Africa)" title="Lake Albert (Africa)">Lake Albert</a> (known during the Mobutu era as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko), <a href="/wiki/Lake_Kivu" title="Lake Kivu">Lake Kivu</a> (Unknown until late 1712), <a href="/wiki/Lake_Edward" title="Lake Edward">Lake Edward</a> (known during the <a href="/wiki/Idi_Amin" title="Idi Amin">Amin</a> era as Lake Idi Amin Dada), and <a href="/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika" title="Lake Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>. Lake Edward and Lake Albert are connected by the <a href="/wiki/Semliki_River" title="Semliki River">Semliki River</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Rift_valley" title="Rift valley">Rift valley</a> has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining. <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">Cobalt</a>, copper, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a>, industrial and gem-quality <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diamonds" title="Diamonds">diamonds</a>, gold, silver, <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tin" title="Tin">tin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germanium" title="Germanium">germanium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Radium" title="Radium">radium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bauxite" title="Bauxite">bauxite</a>, iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo's southeastern Katanga region.</p>


<p>On 17 January 2002 <a href="/wiki/Mount_Nyiragongo" title="Mount Nyiragongo">Mount Nyiragongo</a> erupted in Congo, with the lava running out at 64 km/h (40 mph) and 46 m (50 yards) wide. One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of <a href="/wiki/Goma" title="Goma">Goma</a>, killing 45 and leaving 120,000 homeless. Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption. The lava poisoned the water of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Kivu" title="Lake Kivu">Lake Kivu</a>, killing fish. Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol. The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway, trapping several airplanes.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bushmeat">Bushmeat</span></h4>
<p>Over the past century or so, the DRC has become the center of what has been called the Central African "<a href="/wiki/Bushmeat" title="Bushmeat">bushmeat</a>" problem, regarded by many as a major environmental and socio-economic crisis. "Bushmeat" is another word for the meat of wild animals, typically obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or else with shotguns, poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's numerous military conflicts.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Bushmeat" title="Bushmeat">bushmeat</a> crisis emerged mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the Congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it. A rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions made many Congolese dependent on bushmeat, either as an income source (selling the meat), or for food. Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of <a href="/wiki/Kinshasa" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> into prime markets for commercial bushmeat.</p>
<p>This combination has caused widespread endangerment of local fauna, and has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat. This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans. The hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congo's rainforests from both corporate logging, and farmers clearing forest landfor agriculture. Logging allows hunters much easier access to previously-unreachable jungle terrain, while simultaneously eroding away the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitats" title="Habitats">habitats</a> of animals. <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">Deforestation</a> is accelerating in Central Africa.</p>

<p>After a four-year interlude between two constitutions, with new political institutions established at the various levels of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country, a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable <a href="/wiki/Presidential_system" title="Presidential system">presidential</a> <a href="/wiki/Democratic_republic" title="Democratic republic">democratic republic</a>. The 2003 transitional constitution had established a parliament with a <a href="/wiki/Bicameralism" title="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> legislature, consisting of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Senate_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Senate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">Senate</a> and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Assembly_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">National Assembly</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">President</a> and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in Chief of the armed forces. The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.</p>
<p>The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime Minister, appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The government – not the President – is responsible to the Parliament. The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments, creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government, whom they elect. The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new institutions.

<p>Mobutu Sese Seko ruled the DRC, which he renamed <a href="/wiki/Zaire" title="Zaire">Zaire</a>, from 1965 to 1997. A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: "Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu's authority, and take out ten. Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine." Mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control, leading to an <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo#1990s" title="Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">economic collapse in 1996</a>.</p>
<p>Mobutu allegedly stole as much as US$4-5 billion while in office; in July 2009, a Swiss court determined that the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_limitations" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> had run out on an <a href="/wiki/International_asset_recovery" title="International asset recovery">international asset recovery</a> case of about $6.7 million of deposits of Mobutu's in a Swiss bank, and therefore the assets should be returned to Mobutu's family.</p>

<p>In July 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern about the situation in eastern DRC.

<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is widely considered to be one of the world's richest countries in natural resources; its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US$24 trillion. The Congo has 70% of the world's <a href="/wiki/Coltan" title="Coltan">coltan</a>, a third of its <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a>, more than 30% of its diamond reserves, and a tenth of its copper.</p>
<p>Despite such vast mineral wealth, the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. The African country generated up to 70% of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s, and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time. By 2005, 90% of the DRC's revenues derived from its minerals (Exenberger and Hartmann 2007:10). The country's woes mean that despite its potential its citizens are among the poorest people on earth.

<p>The Congo is the world's largest producer of <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> ore, and a major producer of copper and diamonds. The latter come from Kasai province in the west. By far the largest mines in the Congo are located in southern <a href="/wiki/Katanga_Province" title="Katanga Province">Katanga province</a> (formerly <a href="/wiki/Katanga_Province" title="Katanga Province">Shaba</a>), and are highly mechanized, with a capacity of several millions of tons per year of copper and cobalt ore, and refining capability for metal ore. The DRC is the second-largest diamond-producing nation in the world, and artisanal and small-scale miners account for most of its production.</p>
<p>At independence in 1960, DRC was the second-most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa; it boasted a thriving mining sector and a relatively productive agriculture sector. The <a href="/wiki/First_Congo_War" title="First Congo War">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Congo_War" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo Wars</a> began in 1996. These conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, increased external debt, and resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war and associated <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a> and disease. <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">Malnutrition</a> affects approximately two thirds of the country's population.</p>
<p>Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. The war intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations.</p>
<p>Conditions improved in late 2002, when a large portion of the invading foreign troops withdrew. A number of <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> missions met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Kabila" title="Joseph Kabila">Joseph Kabila</a> began implementing reforms. Much economic activity still lies outside the GDP data. A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Development_Index" title="United Nations Human Development Index">United Nations Human Development Index</a> report shows that the human development index of DR Congo is one of the worst it's had in decades. Through 2011 the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries. It ranked lower than <a href="/wiki/Niger" title="Niger">Niger</a>, despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country over 2010's numbers.</p>


<p>The economy of DR Congo, the second largest country in Africa, relies heavily on mining. However, the smaller-scale economic activity from <a href="/wiki/Artisanal_mining" title="Artisanal mining">artisanal mining</a> occurs in the <a href="/wiki/Informal_sector" title="Informal sector">informal sector</a> and is not reflected in GDP data. A third of the DRC's diamonds are believed to be smuggled out of the country, making it difficult to quantify diamond <a href="/wiki/Production_(economics)" title="Production (economics)">production</a> levels. In 2002, <a href="/wiki/Tin" title="Tin">tin</a> was discovered in the east of the country, but to date has only been mined on a small scale. Smuggling of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conflict_minerals" title="Conflict minerals">conflict minerals</a> such as coltan and <a href="/wiki/Cassiterite" title="Cassiterite">cassiterite</a>, ores of tantalum and tin, respectively, helped to fuel the war in the Eastern Congo.</p>
<p>In September 2004, state-owned <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A9camines" title="Gécamines">Gécamines</a> signed an agreement with Global Enterprises Corporate (GEC), a company formed by the merger of <a href="/wiki/Dan_Gertler" title="Dan Gertler">Dan Gertler International</a> (DGI) with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beny_Steinmetz_Global" title="Beny Steinmetz Global">Beny Steinmetz Global</a>, to rehabilitate and operate the <a href="/wiki/Kananga_Mine" title="Kananga Mine">Kananga</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tilwezembe" title="Tilwezembe">Tilwezembe</a> copper mines. The deal was ratified by presidential decree. In 2007 a World Bank report reviewed DR Congo's three biggest mining contracts, finding that the 2005 deals, including one with Global Enterprises Company, were approved with "a complete lack of transparency" (Mahtani, 3 January 2007). Gertler and Steinmetz put GEC's 75% share in Komoto Oliveira Virgule (KOV), the project made of up of Tilwezembe and Kananga, along with the Kolwesi concentrator, into <a href="/wiki/Nikanor_Plc" title="Nikanor Plc">Nikanor Plc</a>.

In January 2008 <a href="/wiki/Katanga_Mining" title="Katanga Mining">Katanga Mining</a> acquired Nikanor for $452 million</p>
<p>In April 2006 Gertler's DGI took a major stake in DEM Mining, a cobalt-copper mining and services company based in Katanga. In June 2006 Gertler bought <a href="/wiki/Tremalt" title="Tremalt">Tremalt</a> from the Zimbabwean businessman <a href="/wiki/John_Bredenkamp" title="John Bredenkamp">John Bredenkamp</a> for about $60 million. Tremalt had a half share in the <a href="/wiki/Mukondo_Mine" title="Mukondo Mine">Mukondo Mine</a>. In 2007 Tremalt was owned by Prairie International Ltd, of which Dan Gertler's family trust was a major shareholder. Tremalt owned 80% of Savannah Mining, which held concessions C17 and C18 in Katanga Province and 50% of the Mukondo project. The other 50% of Mukonda was held by Boss Mining, which in turn was 80% owned by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Central_African_Mining_%26_Exploration_Company" title="Central African Mining &amp; Exploration Company">Central African Mining &amp; Exploration Company</a> (CAMEC). Boss Mining had rented and operated Bredenkamp's half of Mukondo. Gertler terminated this arrangement.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Katanga_Mining" title="Katanga Mining">Katanga Mining Limited</a>, a Swiss-owned company, owns the Luilu Metallurgical Plant, which has a capacity of 175,000 tonnes of copper and 8,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world. After a major rehabilitation program, the company resumed copper production operations in December 2007 and cobalt production in May 2008.</p>
<p>In April 2013, anti-corruption NGOs revealed that Congolese tax authorities had failed to account for $88 million from the mining sector, despite booming production and positive industrial performance. The missing funds date from 2010 and tax bodies should have paid them into the central bank.

<p>Over 200 ethnic groups populate the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which the majority are <a href="/wiki/Bantu_peoples" title="Bantu peoples">Bantu peoples</a>. Together, <a href="/wiki/Mongo_people" title="Mongo people">Mongo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luba_people" title="Luba people">Luba</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kongo_people" title="Kongo people">Kongo</a> peoples (Bantu) and <a href="/wiki/Mangbetu_people" title="Mangbetu people">Mangbetu</a>-<a href="/wiki/Zande_people" title="Zande people">Azande</a> peoples constitute around 45% of the population. The <a href="/wiki/Kongo_people" title="Kongo people">Kongo people</a> are the largest ethnic group in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>In 2009, the United Nations estimated the country's population to be 66 million people, a rapid increase from 39.1 million in 1992 despite the ongoing war. As many as 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named. The most numerous people are the <a href="/wiki/Kongo_people" title="Kongo people">Kongo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luba_people" title="Luba people">Luba</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mongo_people" title="Mongo people">Mongo</a>. About 600,000 <a href="/wiki/Congo_Pygmies" title="Congo Pygmies">Pygmies</a> are the aboriginal people of the DR Congo.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>

<p>Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data. However, evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants, in spite of recent declines in their numbers. Immigration is very diverse in nature; refugees and asylum-seekers – products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the <a href="/wiki/African_Great_Lakes" title="African Great Lakes">Great Lakes Region</a> – constitute an important subset of the population. Additionally, the country's large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond. There is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role.</p>
<p>Immigration to the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced. According to the <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration" title="International Organization for Migration">International Organization for Migration</a>, the number of immigrants in the DRC has fallen from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Official figures are unavailable, partly due to the predominance of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Informal_economy" title="Informal economy">informal economy</a> in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring countries' ethnic links to DRC nationals, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon.</p>
<p>Figures for Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of whom live in Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimated 2000 data. New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe. The DRC has produced a considerable number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Refugees" title="Refugees">refugees</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Asylum-seekers" title="Asylum-seekers">asylum-seekers</a> located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNHCR" title="UNHCR">UNHCR</a>, there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of whom were living in other African countries.</p>
<p>Since 2003, more than 400,000 Congolese migrants have been expelled from <a href="/wiki/Angola" title="Angola">Angola</a>.</p>

<p>Christianity is the majority religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by about 95% of the population according to a 2010 <a href="/wiki/Pew_Research_Center" title="Pew Research Center">Pew Research Center</a> estimate, and 80% according to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook" title="CIA World Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pew_Research_Center" title="Pew Research Center">Pew Research Center</a> 2013 data. Indigenous beliefs account for about 1.8–10%, and Islam for 10–12%.</p>
<p>There are about 35 million Catholics in the country with six <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archdiocese" title="Archdiocese">archdioceses</a> and 41 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dioceses" title="Dioceses">dioceses</a>. The impact of the Roman Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo is difficult to overestimate. Schatzberg has called it the country's "only truly national institution apart from the state." Its schools have educated over 60% of the nation's primary school students and more than 40% of its secondary students. The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals, schools, and clinics, as well as many diocesan economic enterprises, including farms, ranches, stores, and artisans' shops.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Kimbanguism" title="Kimbanguism">Kimbanguism</a> was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians. Kimbanguism, officially "the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu", now has about three million members, primarily among the <a href="/wiki/Kongo_people" title="Kongo people">Bakongo</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bas-Congo" title="Bas-Congo">Bas-Congo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kinshasa" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>.</p>
<p>62 Protestant denominations are federated under the umbrella of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ_in_Congo" title="Church of Christ in Congo">Church of Christ in Congo</a>.

<p>According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pew_Forum" title="Pew Forum">Pew Forum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Islam_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Islam in the Democratic Republic of the Congo">Islam</a> is the faith of 12% of the population.

<p>The first members of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baha%27i_Faith" title="Baha'i Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> to live in the country came from Uganda in 1953. Four years later the first local administrative council was elected. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly (national administrative council) was first elected. Though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 1980s, due to misrepresentations of foreign governments, the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s. In 2012 plans were announced to build a national <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baha%27i_House_of_Worship" title="Baha'i House of Worship">Baha'i House of Worship</a> in the country.</p>

The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity. New variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread, led by US-inspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations, particularly against children and the elderly. Children accused of witchcraft are sent away from homes and family, often to live on the street, which can lead to physical violence against these children. The usual term for these children is <i>enfants sorciers</i> (child witches) or <i>enfants dits sorciers</i> (children accused of witchcraft). Non-denominational church organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging exorbitant fees for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exorcisms" title="Exorcisms">exorcisms</a>. Though recently outlawed, children have been subjected in these exorcisms to often-violent abuse at the hands of self-proclaimed prophets and priests.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Languages_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a></div>
<p>French is the <a href="/wiki/Official_language" title="Official language">official language</a> of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is culturally accepted as the <i><a href="/wiki/Lingua_franca" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a></i> facilitating communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo. According to a 2014 <a href="/wiki/Organisation_internationale_de_la_Francophonie" title="Organisation internationale de la Francophonie">OIF</a> report, 33 million Congolese people (47% of the population) can read and write in French. In the capital city <a href="/wiki/Kinshasa" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>, 67% of the population can read and write French, and 68.5% can speak and understand it.</p>
<p>Approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country, but only four have the status of national languages: <a href="/wiki/Kituba_language" title="Kituba language">Kituba</a> ("Kikongo ya leta"), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lingala_language" title="Lingala language">Lingala</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tshiluba_language" title="Tshiluba language">Tshiluba</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a>. Although some people speak these regional, or trade languages as first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language. Lingala was the official language of the colonial army, the "<a href="/wiki/Force_Publique" title="Force Publique">Force Publique</a>", under Belgian colonial rule, and remains to this day the predominant language in the armed forces. Since the recent rebellions, a good part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent.</p>
<p>When the country was a Belgian colony, the Belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. This trend was reversed after independence, when French became the sole language of education at all levels. Since 1975, the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education, with French becoming the sole language of education from the 3rd year onwards, but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use French from the first year of school onward.</p>

<p>The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_group" title="Ethnic group">ethnic groups</a> and their differing ways of life throughout the country  — from the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Congo_River" title="Congo River">River Congo</a> on the coast, upriver through the <a href="/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a> in its centre, to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a>, the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era, and most recently, the <a href="/wiki/First_Congo_War" title="First Congo War">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Congo_War" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo Wars</a>. Despite these pressures, the <a href="/wiki/Convention_(norm)" title="Convention (norm)">customs</a> and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality. The country's 60 million inhabitants are mainly rural. The 30% who live in urban areas have been the most open to <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western</a> influences.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h3>
<p>Another notable feature in Congo culture is its music. The DRC has blended its ethnic musical sources with Cuban <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cuban_Rumba" title="Cuban Rumba">rumba</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Merengue_music" title="Merengue music">merengue</a> to give birth to <a href="/wiki/Soukous" title="Soukous">soukous</a>. Other African nations produce music genres that are derived from Congolese soukous. Some of the African bands sing in <a href="/wiki/Lingala" title="Lingala">Lingala</a>, one of the main languages in the DRC. The same Congolese soukous, under the guidance of "le sapeur", <a href="/wiki/Papa_Wemba" title="Papa Wemba">Papa Wemba</a>, has set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designer clothes. They came to be known as the fourth generation of Congolese music and mostly come from the former well-known band Wenge Musica.</p>
<p>The Congo is also known for its art. Traditional art includes masks and wooden statues.</p>
