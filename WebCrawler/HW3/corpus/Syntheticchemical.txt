<p><b>Chemical synthesis</b> is a purposeful execution of <a href="/wiki/Chemical_reaction" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reactions</a> to obtain a <a href="/wiki/Product_(chemistry)" title="Product (chemistry)">product</a>, or several products.  This happens by <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physical</a> and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> usage, this tends to imply that the process is reproducible, reliable, and established to work in multiple laboratories.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>

<p>A chemical synthesis—<i>synthesis,</i> in its present meaning originating with chemist <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Kolbe" title="Hermann Kolbe">Hermann Kolbe</a>—begins with the careful selection of the target, based on the relationship of <i>possible</i> targets of chemical, functional, or therapeutic interest to the broader aims of the research effort, whether industrial or academic; various further practical concerns come into play, including manpower available for the campaign, as well as availability of material resources (necessary equipment, starting materials and bulk chemicals, etc.), and along with these, budget for these practical necessities. For instance, a prior developed reaction methodology may highlight particular man-made or natural compounds that would serve the purposes of the effort, in highlighting the breadth of the new methodology; alternatively, grant or unit budgetary or timeline constraints may necessitate aiming for a simpler member of a family of complex natural products, or practical constraints such as the lack of suitable starting materials may necessitate a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi-synthesis" title="Semi-synthesis">semi-synthesis</a> over a <a href="/wiki/Total_synthesis" title="Total synthesis">total synthesis</a>, etc. Once the target or targets are established, the next critical phase begins, that of <i>synthetic design</i>, typically in modern efforts, in the area of <a href="/wiki/Organic_synthesis" title="Organic synthesis">organic synthesis</a>, using <a href="/wiki/Retrosynthetic_analysis" title="Retrosynthetic analysis">retrosynthetic analysis</a>, as championed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/E.J._Corey" title="E.J. Corey">E.J. Corey</a> and others.</p>
<p>An eventual step is selection of <a href="/wiki/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">compounds</a> that are known as <a href="/wiki/Reagent" title="Reagent">reagents</a> or reactants. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_reactions" title="List of reactions">Various reaction types</a> can be applied to these to synthesize the product, or an intermediate product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel such as a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_reactor" title="Chemical reactor">chemical reactor</a> or a simple <a href="/wiki/Round-bottom_flask" title="Round-bottom flask">round-bottom flask</a>. Many reactions require some form of <a href="/wiki/Work-up_(chemistry)" title="Work-up (chemistry)">work-up</a> procedure before the final product is isolated. The isolation (purification) of the product then proceeds via a variety of methods.</p>
<p>The amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the <a href="/wiki/Yield_(chemistry)" title="Yield (chemistry)">reaction yield</a>. Typically, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical_yield" title="Chemical yield">chemical yields</a> are expressed as a weight in <a href="/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">grams</a> (in a laboratory setting) or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced. A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that diminishes the yield of the desired product.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategies">Strategies</span></h2>


<p>Many strategies exist in chemical synthesis that go beyond converting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactant" title="Reactant">reactant</a> A to reaction product B in a single step. In <b>multistep synthesis</b>, a chemical compound is synthesised though a series of individual chemical reactions, each with their own work-up.  For example, a laboratory synthesis of <a href="/wiki/Paracetamol#Synthesis" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a> can consist of three individual synthetic steps. In <a href="/wiki/Cascade_reaction" title="Cascade reaction">cascade reactions</a> multiple chemical transformations take place within a single reactant, in <a href="/wiki/Multi-component_reaction" title="Multi-component reaction">multi-component reactions</a> up to 11 different reactants form a single reaction product and in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telescopic_synthesis" title="Telescopic synthesis">telescopic synthesis</a> one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolation of intermediates.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organic_synthesis">Organic synthesis</span></h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/Organic_synthesis" title="Organic synthesis">Organic synthesis</a> is a special branch of chemical synthesis dealing with the synthesis of <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic compounds</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Total_synthesis" title="Total synthesis">total synthesis</a> of a complex product it may take multiple steps to synthesize the product of interest, and inordinate amounts of time. Skill in organic synthesis is prized among chemists and the synthesis of exceptionally valuable or difficult compounds has won chemists such as <a href="/wiki/Robert_Burns_Woodward" title="Robert Burns Woodward">Robert Burns Woodward</a> the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize for Chemistry">Nobel Prize for Chemistry</a>. If a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new, it is a purely synthetic process. If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to new compounds, the synthesis is described as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semisynthetic" title="Semisynthetic">semisynthetic</a> process.</p>
