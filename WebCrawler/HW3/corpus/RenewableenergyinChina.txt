<p>China’s <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sector is growing faster than its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> capacity. In 2015 China became world's largest producer of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_power" title="Photovoltaic power">photovoltaic power</a>, at 43 GW installed capacity. China also led the world in the production and use of <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Smart_grid" title="Smart grid">smart grid</a> technologies, generating almost as much water, wind, and <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> as all of France and Germany's power plants combined.</p>
<p>Whilst China has the world's largest installations of solar and wind power its energy needs are so great that in 2013 renewables provided just a little over 20% of its power generation, with most of the remainder provided by traditional coal power facilities. Nevertheless, the share of renewables in the energy mix had been gradually rising from 2013 and targets from 2015 onwards have represented a step change in ambition. The next few years will demonstrate whether these ambitious targets can be delivered. As of the end of 2015 the world leading countries in wind power by installations (although the USA generated slightly more wind power at 190 TWh as of 186.3 TWh in China) were: 1. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_China" title="Wind power in China">China</a> 2. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_States" title="Wind power in the United States">Usa</a> 3. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Germany" title="Wind power in Germany">Germany</a> 4. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_India" title="Wind power in India">India</a> 5. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Spain" title="Wind power in Spain">Spain</a> and 6. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Wind power in the United Kingdom">UK</a>, and in solar power installations: 1. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_China" title="Solar power in China">China</a> 2. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Germany" title="Solar power in Germany">Germany</a> 3. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Japan" title="Solar power in Japan">Japan.</a> 4. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_States" title="Solar power in the United States">United States</a> 5. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Italy" title="Solar power in Italy">Italy</a> and 6. <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Solar power in the United Kingdom">UK</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013 China had a total capacity of 378 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">GW</a> of renewable power, mainly from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>. China sees renewables as a source of <a href="/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy security</a> and not just only to reduce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_emission" title="Carbon emission">carbon emission</a>. China’s Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution issued by China’s State Council in September 2013, illustrates the government's desire to increase the share of renewables in China’s <a href="/wiki/Energy_mix" title="Energy mix">energy mix</a>. Unlike oil, coal and gas, the supplies of which are finite and subject to geopolitical tensions, renewable energy systems can be built and used wherever there is sufficient water, wind, and sun.</p>
<p>Since 2005, production of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_cells" title="Solar cells">solar cells</a> in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped dramatically. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Renewable_electricity_overview">Renewable electricity overview</span></h2>

<p>As of year end 2013 hydroelectric power remained by far the largest component of renewable electricity production at 920.3 TWh. Wind power provided the next largest share with 141.2 TWh followed by biofuels at 38.3 TWh. Solar PV power started from a low base of just 0.152 GWh in 2008 and has grown rapidly since then to reach 15.5 TWh by 2013. The overall share of electricity generated from renewable sources based on the figures in the above table has grown from a little over 17% in 2008 to a little over 20% by 2013. Whilst later figures are not available between the end of 2013 and 2015 wind turbine installations have increased by more than half and solar power installations have more than doubled.

The project is located in Dang Town, Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gansu_Province" title="Gansu Province">Gansu Province</a>, China, and was certified by the <a href="/wiki/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission" title="National Development and Reform Commission">National Development and Reform Commission</a> (NDRC) to be in compliance with the "Measures for the Operation and Management of Clean Development Mechanism Projects in China". The power generated by the project will be sold to the Gansu power grid which is part of the China Northwest Regional Power Grid (NWPG). This will displace equivalent amounts of electricity generated by the current mix of power sold to the NWPG. The developer of the Gansu Dang River Hydropower Project, which started construction on November 1, 2004, is the Jiayuguan City Tongyuan Hydropower Co., Ltd. The Letter of Approval of the NDRC permits the Jiayuguan City Tongyuan Hydropower Co., Ltd. to transfer to Japan Carbon Finance, Ltd., an entity approved by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Japan" title="Government of Japan">government of Japan</a> no more than 1.2 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions in total <a href="/wiki/Certified_Emission_Reduction" title="Certified Emission Reduction">Certified Emission Reductions</a> (CERs) over the seven-year period beginning on May 1, 2007, and ending on April 30, 2014.</p>
<p>In 2006 there were 10 GW of installed hydropower capacity that went into operation in China. The National Development and Reform Commission also approved thirteen additional hydropower projects in 2006, which cumulatively will have 19.5 GW of power generating capacity. New hydropower projects that were approved and began construction in 2006 include the <a href="/wiki/Jinsha_River" title="Jinsha River">Jinsha River</a> <a href="/wiki/Xiangjiaba_Dam" title="Xiangjiaba Dam">Xiangjiaba Dam</a> (6000 MW), the <a href="/wiki/Yalong_River" title="Yalong River">Yalong River</a> (Second Phase) (4800 MW), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lancang_River" title="Lancang River">Lancang River</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Jinghong_Dam" title="Jinghong Dam">Jinghong Dam</a> (1750 MW), the <a href="/wiki/Beipan_River" title="Beipan River">Beipan River</a>(1040 MW), and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wu_River_(Yangtze_River)" title="Wu River (Yangtze River)">Wu River's</a> <a href="/wiki/Silin_Dam" title="Silin Dam">Silin Dam</a> (1080 MW).

<p>China has the largest wind resources in the world and three-quarters of this natural resource is located at sea. China aims to have 100 GW of wind power capacity by 2020. China encourages foreign companies, especially from the United States, to visit and invest in Chinese wind power generation. However, use of wind energy in China has not always kept up with the remarkable construction of wind power capacity in the country.</p>
<p>As of 2010, China has become the world's largest maker of wind turbines, surpassing Denmark, Germany, Spain, and the United States. The initial future target set by the Chinese government was 10 GW by 2010, but the total installed capacity for wind power generation in China had already reached 25.1 GW by the end of 2009.</p>
<p>By 2009 China had total installed windpower capacity up to 26 GW. China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country's economy.</p>
<p>In 2008 China was the fourth largest producer of wind power after the United States, Germany, and Spain. At the end of 2008, wind power in China accounted for 12.2 GW of electricity generating capacity. By the end of 2008, at least fifteen Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components. Turbine sizes of 1.5 MW and 2 MW became common. Leading wind power companies were <a href="/wiki/Goldwind" title="Goldwind">Goldwind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dongfang_Electric" title="Dongfang Electric">Dongfang</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sinovel" title="Sinovel">Sinovel</a>. China also increased the production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines (80 MW) in 2008. Through all these developments, the Chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932010" title="Financial crisis of 2007–2010">global financial crisis</a>, according to industry observers.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_China" title="Solar power in China">Solar power in China</a></div>
<p>China produces 63% of the world's solar <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a> (PV). It has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer as of June 2015.</p>
<p>Following the new incentive scheme of Golden Sun announced by the government in 2009, there are numerous recent developments and plans announced by industry players that became part of the milestones for solar industry and technology development in China, such as the new thin film solar plant developed by <a href="/wiki/Anwell_Technologies" title="Anwell Technologies">Anwell Technologies</a> in the Henan province using its own proprietary solar technology. The agreement was signed by LDK for a 500 MW solar project in the desert, alongside First Solar and Ordos City. The effort to drive the renewable energy use in China was further assured after the speech of the Chinese President given at the UN climate summit on 22 September 2009 in New York, pledging that China would adopt plans to use 15% of its energy from renewable sources within a decade.</p>
<p>China has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology, with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over $15 billion. Around 820 MW of solar PV were produced in China in 2007, second only to Japan.</p>

<p>China emerged as the world's third largest producer of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>-based <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bio-fuel" title="Bio-fuel">bio-fuels</a> (after the <a href="/wiki/Biofuel_in_the_United_States" title="Biofuel in the United States">U.S</a> and <a href="/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Brazil" title="Energy policy of Brazil">Brazil</a>) at the end of the 10th Five Year Plan Period in 2005 and at present ethanol accounts for 20% of total <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automotive" title="Automotive">automotive</a> fuel consumption in China. In the 11th Five Year Plan period (2006 through 2010) China planned to develop six megatons/year of fuel ethanol capacity, which is expected to grow to 15 megatons/year by 2020. Despite this level of production, experts say that there will be no threat to food security, though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be "farming oil" if the price of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a> continues to increase. Based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in China, the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for plants in these provinces. In the recently published <i><a href="/wiki/World_Economic_Outlook" title="World Economic Outlook">World Economic Outlook</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops.</p>
<p>Work has begun on the <span style="white-space: nowrap">¥250 million</span> Kaiyou Green Energy Biomass (Rice Husks) Power Generating project located in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Suqian_City" title="Suqian City">Suqian City</a> Economic Development Zone in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jiangsu_Province" title="Jiangsu Province">Jiangsu Province</a>.

<p>Geothermal resources in China are abundant and widely distributed throughout the country. There are over 2,700 hot springs occurring at the surface, with temperatures exceeding 250 °C. In 1990, the total flow rate of thermal water for direct uses amounted to over 9,500 kg/s, making China the second direct user of geothermal energy in the world. Recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s, China has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation. Until 2006, 181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland China, with an estimated generation potential of 1,740 MW. However, only seven plants, with a total capacity of 32 MW, had been constructed and were operating in 2006.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Energy_policy_of_China" title="Energy policy of China">Energy policy of China</a></div>
<p>After the dissolution of the Energy and Industry Department in 1993, China has been running without a government agency effectively managing the country's energy. Related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Commerce, State electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) and so forth. In 2008, the National Energy Administration was founded under the NDRC, however its work has been proven inefficient. In January 2010, the State Council decided to set up a National Energy Commission (NEC), headed by current Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan, reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy. From 2008 to January 2012, China held the top spot in clean energy investment. The Renewable Energy Law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Twelfth_Five-Year_Plan_(People%27s_Republic_of_China)" title="Twelfth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)">Twelfth Five-Year Plan</a>, the current plan, also places great emphasis on green energy. Detailed incentive policies and programs include the Golden Sun program, which provides financial subsidies, technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry; the Suggestions on Promoting Wind Electricity Industry in 2006, which offers preferential policies for wind power development; and many other policies. Besides promoting policies, China has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products, to prevent environmental damage, and to regulate the price of green energy. These policies include, but are not limited to Renewable Energy Law, the Safety Regulations of Hydropower Dams and the National Standard of Solar Water Heaters.</p>
<p>Several provisions in relevant Chinese laws and regulations address the development of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methane_gas" title="Methane gas">methane gas</a> in rural China. These provisions include Article 54 of the Agriculture Law of the People's Republic of China, Articles 4 and 11 of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_Conservation" title="Energy Conservation">Energy Conservation</a> Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 18 of the Renewable Energy Law of the People's Republic of China and Article 12 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning Restoring <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">Farmland</a> to <a href="/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">Forest</a>.</p>

<p>According to China's "Energy Blue Paper" recently written by the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences" title="Chinese Academy of Social Sciences">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</a>, the average rate of recovery of <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> from <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">mining</a> in China is only 30%, less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world; the rate of recovery of coal resources in the U.S., <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> is ~80%. The rate of recovery of coal from mining in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shanxi_Province" title="Shanxi Province">Shanxi Province</a>, China's largest source of coal is approximately 40%, though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in Shanxi Province is only 10%-20%. Cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years (1980–2000) China has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal. The same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal mining—that extraction methods are backwards—lead to safety problems in China's <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">coal mining</a> sector. Another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining; of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by China, only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines. Based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30%, if China were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal.</p>

<p>In 2011, China produced 6% of its energy from hydroelectric, &lt;1% from nuclear, and 1% from other renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Chinese energy experts are estimating that by 2050 the percentage of China's energy requirements that are satisfied by coal-fired plants will have declined to 30-50% of total energy consumption and that the remaining 50-70% will be provided by a combination of <a href="/wiki/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources, including <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>, solar energy, wind energy, and other renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>In 2007, transportation's share of crude oil consumption in China is approximately 35%, but that by 2020 consumption of crude oil for transportation purposes will have increased to 50% of total crude oil consumption.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the Energy Research Institute of the <a href="/wiki/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission" title="National Development and Reform Commission">National Development and Reform Commission</a> on the economic circumstances of China's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chemical_industry" title="Chemical industry">chemical industry</a> as of 2007, in recent years China has wasted an average of 400 megatons of coal equivalents per year. In 2006, China consumed a total of 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents, up from 1.4 gigatons of coal equivalents consumed nationwide in 2000. With energy consumption increasing at the rate of 10%/year, in the last 5 years total energy consumption has exceeded the combined amount of energy consumption over the previous 20 years. According to Dai Yande, the chairman of the Energy Research Institute of the NDRC, while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable, China must take steps to change the form of its <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a> and increase substantially the <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> of Chinese industry and society generally. Among other things China should find new points of <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a> that moves China away from being the "World's Factory" and improves energy efficiency. China also must avoid unnecessary waste, foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy sources to reduce China's reliance on <a href="/wiki/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> energy resources.</p>
<p>Since June 2006 when Chinese Premier <a href="/wiki/Wen_Jiabao" title="Wen Jiabao">Wen Jiabao</a> visited the <a href="/wiki/Shenhua_Group" title="Shenhua Group">Shenhua Group</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Coal_liquefaction" title="Coal liquefaction">coal liquefaction</a> project and expressed that coal-to-liquids production was one important part of China's <a href="/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy security</a>, there have been many new ‘coal to oil' projects announced by many large coal producing provinces and cities. As of the end of 2006 there will 88 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Methyl_alcohol" title="Methyl alcohol">methyl alcohol</a> projects planned; the total capacity of these projects is 48.5 megatons/year. If all of these projects are built, by 2010 output of methyl alcohol will reach 60 megatons/year. This development rush to build coal to oil projects is giving rise to concerns about a new round of wasteful development and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unintended_consequence" title="Unintended consequence">unintended consequences</a> of such rapid development; these include wasteful extraction of coal, excessive use of water (this process requires 10 tons of water for every ton of oil produced), and likely increases in the price of coal.</p>
<p>China and <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> are in talks to link their electric power networks so that China can purchase power from the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Far_East" title="Russian Far East">Russian Far East</a> to supply <a href="/wiki/Northeast_China" title="Northeast China">Northeast China</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dongbei" title="Dongbei">Dongbei</a>). The benefits for China of importing power from neighboring countries include conserving domestic resources, lowering energy consumption, lessening China's dependence on imported oil (80%-90% of which must be shipped through unsafe waters) and reducing pollution discharge. China already has begun to build a 1 MV <a href="/wiki/High_voltage" title="High voltage">high-tension demonstration project</a> and an 800 kV direct power transmission project and after 2010 China will have a long distance high tension, high capacity transmission line for international transmission of electric power. China also is considering connecting its power transmission lines with <a href="/wiki/Mongolia" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Former_Soviet_states" title="Former Soviet states">former Soviet states</a> that border China and specialists predict that by the year 2020 more than 4 PWh of power will be transmitted into China from neighboring states. In that year China is expected to produce 250 megatons of crude oil and be required to import approximately 350 megatons of crude oil, a reliance on exports of 60%. If China is able to import 620 TWh of power from neighbors, it will be able to reduce crude oil imports by 100 megatons. By importing electric from four or five neighboring countries China will not only reduce its dependence on imported crude oil, but also will enhance energy security by diversifying its foreign energy sources, making China less vulnerable to disruptions in supply.</p>
<p>In 2006 a total of 2.8344 PWh of electricity was generated in China from an installed base of 622 GW of power generating capacity; in 2006 alone an additional 105 GW of installed capacity came on line in China. Experts estimate that another 100 GW of newly installed <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" title="Electric power">electric power</a> generating capacity will again come on-line in 2007, but that 2006 probably was the high-water mark for electric power capacity development in China.</p>
