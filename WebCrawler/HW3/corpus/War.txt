<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of <a href="/wiki/Human_nature" title="Human nature">human nature</a>, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.</p>
<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mongol_conquests" title="Mongol conquests">Mongol conquests</a> which was greater than 41 million.

In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Smalley" title="Richard Smalley">Richard Smalley</a> identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">humanity</a> for the next fifty years.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>

<p>The English word <i>war</i> derives from the late <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> (circa.1050) words <i>wyrre</i> and <i>werre</i>, from <a href="/wiki/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> <i>werre</i> (also <i>guerre</i> as in modern French), in turn from the <a href="/wiki/Franks" title="Franks">Frankish</a> *<i>werra</i>, ultimately deriving from the <a href="/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language" title="Proto-Germanic language">Proto-Germanic</a> *<i>werzō</i> 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the <a href="/wiki/Old_Saxon" title="Old Saxon">Old Saxon</a> <i>werran</i>, <a href="/wiki/Old_High_German" title="Old High German">Old High German</a> <i>werran</i>, and the German <i>verwirren</i>, meaning “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”. In German, the equivalent is <i>Krieg</i> (from Proto-Germanic *<i>krīganą</i> 'to strive, be stubborn'); the Spanish, <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, and Italian term for "war" is <i>guerra</i>, derived like the Old French term from the Germanic word. Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for "war", to avoid using the <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>bellum</i>, because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word <i>bello</i> ("beautiful").</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Military_history" title="Military history">Military history</a></div>

<p>The earliest recorded evidence of war belongs to the Mesolithic cemetery <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Site_117" title="Site 117">Site 117</a>, which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death. Since the rise of the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> some 5,000 years ago, military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, "One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).". An unfavorable review of this estimate mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: «In addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed "approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war" to "approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&amp;c.".» The lower figure is more plausible. In pre-civilization times, warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1 % of deaths and claimed 400 million victims. Added to the previous figure of 1,240 million this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th Century. <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare" title="Nuclear warfare">Nuclear warfare</a> breaking out in August 1988, when nuclear arsenals were at peak level, and the aftermath thereof, could have reduced human population from 5,150,000,000 by 1,850,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 within a period of about one year, according to a projection that doesn't consider "the most severe predictions concerning <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_winter" title="Nuclear winter">nuclear winter</a>". This would have been a proportional reduction of the world’s population exceeding the reduction caused in the 14th Century by the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, and comparable in proportional terms with the plague’s impact on Europe's population in 1346-53.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/War_Before_Civilization" title="War Before Civilization">War Before Civilization</a></i>, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign" title="University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign">University of Illinois</a>, says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and many fought constantly.</p>
<p>Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/William_Rubinstein" title="William Rubinstein">William Rubinstein</a> wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].'"</p>

<p>In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place. During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see <a href="/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction" title="Mutual assured destruction">mutual assured destruction</a>), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, and its successor, the United Nations.</p>
<p>Shortly after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former U.S. Department of War was renamed as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Defense" title="U.S. Department of Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a>.</p>

<p>In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atom_bomb" title="Atom bomb">atom bomb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Human_Security_Report_2005" title="Human Security Report 2005">Human Security Report 2005</a> documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.</p>

Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings. Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.</p>

<p>Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay <a href="/wiki/War_reparations" title="War reparations">war reparations</a> to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of <a href="/wiki/Alsace-Lorraine" title="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a> has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.</p>
<p>Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the USA out of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> by most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keynesian" title="Keynesian">Keynesian</a> economists) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the <a href="/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, and <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, warfare primarily results in damage the economy of the countries involved.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="World_War_II">World War II</span></h4>

<p><a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> was the most financially costly conflict in history: its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the <a href="/wiki/War_effort" title="War effort">war effort</a> (as adjusted to 1940 prices). The <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.</p>
<p>By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Axis invasion</a> was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="On_the_arts">On the arts</span></h3>
<p>War leads to <a href="/wiki/Forced_migration" title="Forced migration">forced migration</a> causing potentially large displacements of population. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares of artists and other types of creative people, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country’s creative potential in the long-run.

<p>In war, cultural institutions, such as libraries, can become "targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population." The impact such destruction can have on a society is important because "in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant.

<li>Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of <a href="/wiki/Lebensraum" title="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a> in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars" title="Anglo-Dutch Wars">Anglo-Dutch Wars</a>).</li>
<li>Intangible war aims - like the accumulation of credibility or reputation - may have more tangible expression ("conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power").</li>
</ul>
<p>Explicit/implicit aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.</li>
<li>Implicit war aims can take the form of minutes of discussion, memoranda and instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive/negative aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.</li>
<li>"Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into "peace conditions" - the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war.</p>

It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."</p>
<p>Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Theories_for_motivation">Theories for motivation</span></h2>

<p>There is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war. <a href="/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz" title="Carl von Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a> said, 'Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychoanalytic_psychology">Psychoanalytic psychology</span></h3>
<p>Dutch psychoanalyst <a href="/wiki/Joost_Meerloo" title="Joost Meerloo">Joost Meerloo</a> held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction." Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon <i>others.</i> In this destructive scenario, these <i>others</i> are made to serve as the scapegoat of unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.</p>
<p>Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and <a href="/wiki/John_Bowlby" title="John Bowlby">John Bowlby</a> have argued human beings are <a href="/wiki/Inheritance" title="Inheritance">inherently</a> violent. This aggressiveness is fueled by <a href="/wiki/Displacement_(psychology)" title="Displacement (psychology)">displacement</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychological_projection" title="Psychological projection">projection</a> where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Race_(human_classification)" title="Race (human classification)">races</a>, religions, nations or <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideologies</a>. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.</p>
<p>The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Klein" title="Melanie Klein">Melanie Klein</a>, thought war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning. Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.</p>
<p>Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war,few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace. Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh. He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Evolutionary">Evolutionary</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric_warfare" title="Prehistoric warfare">Prehistoric warfare</a></div>

<p>Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and <a href="/wiki/Competition" title="Competition">competition</a> over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.</p>
<p>The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as <a href="/wiki/Chimpanzee" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a>, as well as in many <a href="/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a> species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.</p>
<p>Psychologist and linguist <a href="/wiki/Steven_Pinker" title="Steven Pinker">Steven Pinker</a> argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory. He also argued that in order to have credible <a href="/wiki/Deterrence_theory" title="Deterrence theory">deterrence</a> against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for <a href="/wiki/Revenge" title="Revenge">revenge</a> as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Honor" title="Honor">honor</a>").</p>

<p>Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ashley_Montagu" title="Ashley Montagu">Ashley Montagu</a> strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chewong" title="Chewong">Chewong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Semai_people" title="Semai people">Semai</a> of the Malay peninsula. Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic">Economic</span></h3>

<p>War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">natural resources</a> and for wealth. War has also been linked to <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a> by economic historians and development economists studying <a href="/wiki/State-building" title="State-building">state-building</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_capacity" title="Fiscal capacity">fiscal capacity</a>. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Right_(politics)" title="Right (politics)">right</a> of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presidents_of_the_United_States" title="Presidents of the United States">Presidents of the United States</a> and U.S. <a href="/wiki/General_officer" title="General officer">Generals</a>, expressed support for an economic view of war.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marxist">Marxist</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (<a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialist</a>) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class system</a>. Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a <a href="/wiki/World_revolution" title="World revolution">world revolution</a>, over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a> theorized that <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> was the result of capitalist countries needing new <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">markets</a>. Expansion of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consumer_demand" title="Consumer demand">consumer demand</a>. Since the workers in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capitalist_economy" title="Capitalist economy">capitalist economy</a> would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Demographic">Demographic</span></h3>
<p>Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Youth_bulge" title="Youth bulge">youth bulge</a> theories.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Malthusian">Malthusian</span></h4>

<p>Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pope_Urban_II" title="Pope Urban II">Pope Urban II</a> in 1095, on the eve of the <a href="/wiki/First_Crusade" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a>, spoke:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Youth_bulge">Youth bulge</span></h4>

<p>According to Heinsohn, who proposed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Youth_bulge" title="Youth bulge">youth bulge</a> theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with <a href="/wiki/Total_fertility_rate" title="Total fertility rate">total fertility rates</a> as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.</p>
<p>Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism, as wellas today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789, and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> in Germany in the 1930s. The 1994 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.</p>
<p>Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank, <a href="/wiki/Population_Action_International" title="Population Action International">Population Action International</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Institute_for_Population_and_Development" title="Berlin Institute for Population and Development">Berlin Institute for Population and Development</a>. Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rationalist">Rationalist</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Rationalism_(international_relations)" title="Rationalism (international relations)">Rationalism</a> is an <a href="/wiki/International_relations_theory" title="International relations theory">international relations theory</a> or framework. Rationalism (and <a href="/wiki/Neorealism_(international_relations)" title="Neorealism (international relations)">Neorealism (international relations)</a>) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war. Under a <a href="/wiki/Game_theory" title="Game theory">Game theory</a> approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. In "Rationalist Explanations for War", <a href="/wiki/James_Fearon" title="James Fearon">James Fearon</a> examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:</p>
<ol>
<li>Issue Indivisibilities</li>
<li>Incentives to Misrepresent or <a href="/wiki/Information_asymmetry" title="Information asymmetry">Information Asymmetry</a></li>
<li>Commitment Problems</li>
</ol>
<p>"Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.</p>

<p>"<a href="/wiki/Information_asymmetry" title="Information asymmetry">Information asymmetry</a> with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Blainey" title="Geoffrey Blainey">Geoffrey Blainey</a> argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power." Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.</p>
<p>Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_bias" title="Cognitive bias">cognitive bias</a>, but are still "as rational as you and me". According to philosopher <a href="/wiki/Iain_King" title="Iain King">Iain King</a>, "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...." King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GroupThink" title="GroupThink">GroupThink</a>" which is faulty, but still rational.</p>
<p>The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_science">Political science</span></h3>
<p>The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson" title="Lewis Fry Richardson">Lewis Fry Richardson</a> following <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the <a href="/wiki/Correlates_of_War" title="Correlates of War">Correlates of War</a> Project, Peter Brecke and the <a href="/wiki/Uppsala_Conflict_Data_Program" title="Uppsala Conflict Data Program">Uppsala Conflict Data Program</a>.</p>
<p>The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Waltz" title="Kenneth Waltz">Kenneth Waltz</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Man,_the_State,_and_War" title="Man, the State, and War">Man, the State, and War</a></i> and has been often used by political scientists since then.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="System-level_theories">System-level theories</span></h4>
<p>There are several different <a href="/wiki/International_relations_theory" title="International relations theory">international relations theory</a> schools. Supporters of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Realism_in_international_relations" title="Realism in international relations">realism in international relations</a> argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the <a href="/wiki/Security_dilemma" title="Security dilemma">security dilemma</a>.</p>
<p>Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as <a href="/wiki/Henry_Kissinger" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hans_Morgenthau" title="Hans Morgenthau">Hans Morgenthau</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Neorealism_(international_relations)" title="Neorealism (international relations)">neorealist</a> school represented by scholars such as <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Waltz" title="Kenneth Waltz">Kenneth Waltz</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Mearsheimer" title="John Mearsheimer">John Mearsheimer</a>, two main sub-theories are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)" title="Balance of power (international relations)">Balance of power</a> theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing." However, evidence has shown power <a href="/wiki/Polarity_(international_relations)" title="Polarity (international relations)">polarity</a> is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Power_transition_theory" title="Power transition theory">Power transition theory</a>: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them. On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become <i>more</i> probable when power is more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has empirical support.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two theories are not mutually exclusive, and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Liberalism_(international_relations)" title="Liberalism (international relations)">Liberalism</a> at it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations. Realists respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency, may escalate tensions and lead to conflict. Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Societal-level_theories">Societal-level theories</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Diversionary_foreign_policy" title="Diversionary foreign policy">Diversionary theory</a>, also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support. This is supported by literature showing outgroup hostility <a href="/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory" title="Realistic conflict theory">enhances</a> ingroup <a href="/wiki/Group_cohesiveness" title="Group cohesiveness">bonding</a>, and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin. However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed. U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Individual-level_theories">Individual-level theories</span></h4>
<p>These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand. For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by <a href="/wiki/Bounded_rationality" title="Bounded rationality">bounded rationality</a> and various <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cognitive_biases" title="Cognitive biases">cognitive biases</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Prospect_theory" title="Prospect theory">prospect theory</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethics">Ethics</span></h2>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a> of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The two principle aspects of ethics in war, according the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Just_War_Theory" title="Just War Theory">Just War Theory</a> are <a href="/wiki/Jus_ad_bellum" title="Jus ad bellum">jus ad bellum</a> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jus_in_bello" title="Jus in bello">Jus in bello</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>Jus ad bellum</i> (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.</p>
<p><i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jus_in_bello" title="Jus in bello">Jus in bello</a></i> (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and who it is not. Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.</p>

<p>Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Law" title="International Law">International Law</a>'s regulations on legitimate war.</p>
<p>Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as <a href="/wiki/Pragmatism" title="Pragmatism">Pragmatism</a>, racism, and <a href="/wiki/Social_Darwinism" title="Social Darwinism">social Darwinism</a>, hold that violence is good. Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archetypes" title="Archetypes">archetypes</a> for the general position that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_ends_justify_the_means" title="The ends justify the means">the ends justify the means</a>. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.</p>
