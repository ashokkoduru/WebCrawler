<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>commodity</i> came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/commodit%C3%A9#French" title="wikt:commodité">commodité</a></i>, "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/commoditas#Latin" title="wikt:commoditas">commoditas</a></i>, meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/commodus#Latin" title="wikt:commodus">commodus</a></i> (from which English gets other words including <i>commodious</i> and <i>accommodate</i>) meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_commodity">Types of commodity</span></h2>
<p>The term <i>commodity</i> is specifically used for an economic good or service when the demand for it has no qualitative <a href="/wiki/Product_differentiation" title="Product differentiation">differentiation</a> across a <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">market</a>. In other words, a commodity good or service has full or partial but substantial <a href="/wiki/Fungibility" title="Fungibility">fungibility</a>; that is, the market treats its instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. As the saying goes, "From the taste of <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, it is not possible to tell who produced it, a <a href="/wiki/Serfdom_in_Russia" title="Serfdom in Russia">Russian serf</a>, a French peasant or an English <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capitalist" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a>." <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">Petroleum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a> are other examples of such commodities, their supply and demand being a part of one universal market. Items such as stereo systems, on the other hand, have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the <a href="/wiki/Brand" title="Brand">brand</a>, the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.</p>
<p>In contrast, one of the characteristics of a commodity good is that its price is determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded <a href="/wiki/Spot_market" title="Spot market">spot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)" title="Derivative (finance)">derivative</a> markets. Generally, these are basic resources and <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> products such as <a href="/wiki/Iron_ore" title="Iron ore">iron ore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a>. <a href="/wiki/Soft_commodity" title="Soft commodity">Soft commodities</a> are goods that are grown, while hard commodities are ones that are extracted through <a href="/wiki/Mining" title="Mining">mining</a>.</p>
<p>There is another important class of energy commodities which includes electricity, gas, <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store; hence, electricity must be consumed as soon as it is processed</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Commoditization">Commoditization</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Commoditization" title="Commoditization">Commoditization</a> occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_capital" title="Intellectual capital">intellectual capital</a> necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium <a href="/wiki/Profit_margin" title="Profit margin">margins</a> for <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">market</a> <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/participation" title="wikt:participation">participants</a> have become commodities, such as <a href="/wiki/Generic_drug" title="Generic drug">generic pharmaceuticals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory" title="Dynamic random-access memory">DRAM chips</a>. An article in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> cites <a href="/wiki/Multivitamin" title="Multivitamin">multivitamin</a> supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50 mg tablet of <a href="/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation. Following this trend, <a href="/wiki/Nanomaterials" title="Nanomaterials">nanomaterials</a> are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.</p>
<p>There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of "commodity versus differentiable product". Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where <a href="/wiki/Electricity_market#Retail_electricity_market" title="Electricity market">energy choice</a> lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as "<a href="/wiki/Organic_food" title="Organic food">organic</a> versus not" or "<a href="/wiki/Free-range_eggs" title="Free-range eggs">cage free</a> versus not" count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or <a href="/wiki/Forest_Stewardship_Council" title="Forest Stewardship Council">Forest Stewardship Council</a> <a href="/wiki/Certified_wood" title="Certified wood">certification</a> count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.</p>

<p>In the original and simplified sense, <i><b>commodities</b></i> were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Labour_is_not_a_commodity" title="Labour is not a commodity">Labour is not a commodity</a></div>
<p>In classical political economy and especially in <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service ("product" or "activity") produced by <a href="/wiki/Labour_power" title="Labour power">human labour</a>. Objects are external to man. However, some objects attain "<a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use value</a>" to persons in this world, when they are found to be "necessary, useful or pleasant in life," "Use value" makes an object "an object of human wants," or is "a means of subsistence in the widest sense."</p>
<p>As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became "commodities." Commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are "exchanged in a market." In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, "use value" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an "exchange value"—a value that could be expressed in the market.</p>
<p>Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> maintained that exchange value was made up of <a href="/wiki/Economic_rent" title="Economic rent">rent</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Economic_profit" title="Economic profit">profit</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_economics" title="Labor economics">labour</a> and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry. <a href="/wiki/David_Ricardo" title="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</a>, a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service. While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.</p>
<p>However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources ("earth itself is an instrument of labour"), even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.</p>
<p>Marx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labour_theory_of_value" title="Labour theory of value">labor theory of value</a>. This problem was extensively debated by <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_Ricardo" title="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Karl_Rodbertus-Jagetzow" title="Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow">Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow</a> among others.</p>
<p>All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the "price" and the "value" of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The "value" of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.</p>
<p>Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the "quantity of labour" to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the "socially necessary labour time" Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the "exchange value" of a given commodity.</p>
<p>Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics, and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists. However, Marx held that the value and price of any commodity would coincide only when demand and supply were equivalent to each other.</p>
