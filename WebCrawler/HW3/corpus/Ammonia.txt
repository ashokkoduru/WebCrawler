<p><b>Ammonia</b> or <b>azane</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">compound</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_formula" title="Chemical formula">formula</a> NH<sub>3</sub>. The simplest <a href="/wiki/Pnictogen_hydride" title="Pnictogen hydride">pnictogen hydride</a>, ammonia is a colourless <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gas</a> with a characteristic pungent smell. It contributes significantly to the <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutritional</a> needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceuticals" title="Pharmaceuticals">pharmaceutical products</a> and is used in many commercial cleaning products.</p>
<p>Although common in nature and in wide use, ammonia is both <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caustic_(substance)" title="Caustic (substance)">caustic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hazard" title="Hazard">hazardous</a> in its concentrated form. It is classified as an <a href="/wiki/List_of_extremely_hazardous_substances" title="List of extremely hazardous substances">extremely hazardous substance</a> in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Emergency_Planning_and_Community_Right-to-Know_Act" title="Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act">Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act</a> (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.</p>
<p>The global industrial production of ammonia in 2014 was 176 million tonnes (173,000,000 long tons; 194,000,000 short tons), a 16% increase over the 2006 global industrial production of 152 million tonnes (150,000,000 long tons; 168,000,000 short tons).</p>
<p>NH<sub>3</sub> boils at −33.34 °C (−28.012 °F) at a pressure of one <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)" title="Atmosphere (unit)">atmosphere</a>, so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_hydroxide" title="Ammonium hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> is a solution of NH<sub>3</sub> in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the <a href="/wiki/Baum%C3%A9_scale" title="Baumé scale">Baumé scale</a> (<a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">density</a>), with 26 degrees baumé (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at 15.5 °C or 59.9 °F) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.</p>

<p>Ammonia is found in trace quantities in nature, being produced from the nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter.

The <a href="/wiki/Kidney" title="Kidney">kidneys</a> secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid. Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.</p>
<p>Ammonia is also found throughout the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> on <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uranus" title="Uranus">Uranus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pluto" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>, among other places: on smaller, icy worlds like Pluto, ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can potentially have a melting point of as low as 173 kelvins if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such worlds to retain internal oceans and active geology far longer than would be possible with water alone. Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called <i>ammoniacal</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties">Properties</span></h2>
<p>Ammonia is a colourless <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gas</a> with a characteristic pungent smell. It is <a href="/wiki/Lighter_than_air" title="Lighter than air">lighter than air</a>, its density being 0.589 times that of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">air</a>. It is easily liquefied due to the strong <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bond" title="Hydrogen bond">hydrogen bonding</a> between molecules; the <a href="/wiki/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquid</a> boils at −33.3 °C (−27.94 °F), and freezes at −77.7 °C (−107.86 °F) to white crystals.</p>
<p>Ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or <a href="/wiki/Acetic_acid" title="Acetic acid">acetic acid</a>. Both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt.</p>




<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure">Structure</span></h3>
<p>The ammonia molecule has a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trigonal_pyramid_(chemistry)" title="Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)">trigonal pyramidal</a> shape as predicted by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valence_shell_electron_pair_repulsion_theory" title="Valence shell electron pair repulsion theory">valence shell electron pair repulsion theory</a> (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a <a href="/wiki/Lone_pair" title="Lone pair">lone electron pair</a>, which makes ammonia a <a href="/wiki/Base_(chemistry)" title="Base (chemistry)">base</a>, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a <a href="/wiki/Dipole" title="Dipole">dipole</a> moment and makes it <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polar_molecule" title="Polar molecule">polar</a>. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bond" title="Hydrogen bond">hydrogen bonds</a>, makes ammonia highly miscible with <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are <a href="/wiki/Protonation" title="Protonation">protonated</a>. Temperature and <a href="/wiki/Salinity" title="Salinity">salinity</a> also affect the proportion of NH<sub>4</sub>. The latter has the shape of a regular <a href="/wiki/Tetrahedron" title="Tetrahedron">tetrahedron</a> and is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isoelectronic" title="Isoelectronic">isoelectronic</a> with <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>.</p>
<p>The ammonia molecule readily undergoes <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_inversion" title="Nitrogen inversion">nitrogen inversion</a> at room temperature; a useful analogy is an <a href="/wiki/Umbrella" title="Umbrella">umbrella</a> turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Resonance_frequency" title="Resonance frequency">resonance frequency</a> is 23.79 <a href="/wiki/Hertz" title="Hertz">GHz</a>, corresponding to <a href="/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwave</a> radiation of a <a href="/wiki/Wavelength" title="Wavelength">wavelength</a> of 1.260 cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microwave_spectroscopy" title="Microwave spectroscopy">microwave spectrum</a> to be observed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Amphotericity">Amphotericity</span></h3>
<p>One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basicity" title="Basicity">basicity</a>. Ammonia is considered to be a weak base. It combines with <a href="/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acids</a> to form <a href="/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)" title="Salt (chemistry)">salts</a>; thus with <a href="/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a> it forms <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_chloride" title="Ammonium chloride">ammonium chloride</a> (sal ammoniac); with <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate" title="Ammonium nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a>, etc. Perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride" title="Hydrogen chloride">hydrogen chloride</a>; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction. As a demonstration experiment, opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride, which seem to appear "out of nothing" as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet, somewhere between the two bottles.</p>

<p>The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the <a href="/wiki/Category:Ammonium_compounds" title="Category:Ammonium compounds">ammonium salts</a> and all contain the <a href="/wiki/Ammonium" title="Ammonium">ammonium ion</a> (NH<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p>Although ammonia is well known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of <a href="/wiki/Amide" title="Amide">amides</a> (which contain the NH<sub>2</sub> ion). For example, <a href="/wiki/Lithium" title="Lithium">lithium</a> dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of <a href="/wiki/Lithium_amide" title="Lithium amide">lithium amide</a>:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Self-dissociation">Self-dissociation</span></h3>
<p>Like water, ammonia undergoes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molecular_autoionisation" title="Molecular autoionisation">molecular autoionisation</a> to form its acid and base conjugates:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Combustion">Combustion</span></h3>
<p>The combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a> is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exothermic" title="Exothermic">exothermic</a>:</p>

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Standard_enthalpy_change_of_combustion" title="Standard enthalpy change of combustion">standard enthalpy change of combustion</a>, Δ<i>H</i>°<sub>c</sub>, expressed per <a href="/wiki/Mole_(unit)" title="Mole (unit)">mole</a> of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is −382.81 kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" title="Nitrogen oxide">nitrogen oxides</a> are unstable with respect to N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, which is the principle behind the <a href="/wiki/Catalytic_converter" title="Catalytic converter">catalytic converter</a>. Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of <a href="/wiki/Nitric_acid" title="Nitric acid">nitric acid</a>:</p>

<p>A subsequent reaction leads to NO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as <a href="/wiki/Platinum" title="Platinum">platinum</a> gauze or warm <a href="/wiki/Chromium(III)_oxide" title="Chromium(III) oxide">chromium(III) oxide</a>), because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia–air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25%.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Organic_chemistry" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, ammonia can act as a <a href="/wiki/Nucleophile" title="Nucleophile">nucleophile</a> in <a href="/wiki/Nucleophilic_substitution" title="Nucleophilic substitution">substitution</a> reactions. <a href="/wiki/Amine" title="Amine">Amines</a> can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alkyl_halide" title="Alkyl halide">alkyl halides</a>, although the resulting -NH<sub>2</sub> group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_halide" title="Hydrogen halide">hydrogen halide</a> formed. <a href="/wiki/Methylamine" title="Methylamine">Methylamine</a> is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with <a href="/wiki/Chloromethane" title="Chloromethane">chloromethane</a>, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Racemic" title="Racemic">racemic</a> <a href="/wiki/Alanine" title="Alanine">alanine</a> in 70% yield. <a href="/wiki/Ethanolamine" title="Ethanolamine">Ethanolamine</a> is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with <a href="/wiki/Ethylene_oxide" title="Ethylene oxide">ethylene oxide</a>: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce <a href="/wiki/Diethanolamine" title="Diethanolamine">diethanolamine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Triethanolamine" title="Triethanolamine">triethanolamine</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Amide" title="Amide">Amides</a> can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with <a href="/wiki/Carboxylic_acid" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acid</a> derivatives. <a href="/wiki/Acyl_chloride" title="Acyl chloride">Acyl chlorides</a> are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride" title="Hydrogen chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> formed. <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">Esters</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anhydride" title="Anhydride">anhydrides</a> also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be <a href="/wiki/Dehydration" title="Dehydration">dehydrated</a> to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200 °C are required.</p>
<p>The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by <a href="/wiki/Metal" title="Metal">metals</a>, thus <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> burns in the gas with the formation of <a href="/wiki/Magnesium_nitride" title="Magnesium nitride">magnesium nitride</a> Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and when the gas is passed over heated <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, sodamide, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, and potassamide, KNH<sub>2</sub>, are formed. Where necessary in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature" title="IUPAC nomenclature">substitutive nomenclature</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IUPAC" title="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> recommendations prefer the name "azane" to ammonia: hence <a href="/wiki/Chloramine" title="Chloramine">chloramine</a> would be named "chloroazane" in substitutive nomenclature, not "chloroammonia".</p>
<p>Pentavalent ammonia is known as λ-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure, and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.</p>

For historical reasons, ammonia is named <b>ammine</b> in the nomenclature of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coordination_compound" title="Coordination compound">coordination compounds</a>. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as <a href="/wiki/Schweizer%27s_reagent" title="Schweizer's reagent">Schweizer's reagent</a>, and has the remarkable ability to dissolve <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a>.

Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: <a href="/wiki/Silver_chloride" title="Silver chloride">silver chloride</a> (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, <a href="/wiki/Silver_bromide" title="Silver bromide">silver bromide</a> (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas <a href="/wiki/Silver_iodide" title="Silver iodide">silver iodide</a> (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.</p>
<p>Ammine complexes of <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a>(III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Werner" title="Alfred Werner">Alfred Werner</a>'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers (<i>fac</i>- and <i>mer</i>-) of the complex [CrCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vertex" title="wikt:vertex">vertices</a> of an <a href="/wiki/Octahedron" title="Octahedron">octahedron</a>.

<p>An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>The Romans gave the name <i>sal ammoniacus</i> (salt of Amun) to the ammonium chloride deposits that they collected near the Temple of <a href="/wiki/Amun" title="Amun">Amun</a> (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> Ἄμμων <i>Ammon</i>) in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Libya" title="Ancient Libya">ancient Libya</a>.

<p>In the form of sal ammoniac <i>(نشادر, nushadir)</i> ammonia was important to the <a href="/wiki/Alchemy_and_chemistry_in_medieval_Islam" title="Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam">Muslim alchemists</a> as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian chemist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/J%C4%81bir_ibn_Hayy%C4%81n" title="Jābir ibn Hayyān">Jābir ibn Hayyān</a>, and to the European <a href="/wiki/Alchemy" title="Alchemy">alchemists</a> since the 13th century, being mentioned by <a href="/wiki/Albertus_Magnus" title="Albertus Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a>.

At a later period, when sal ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with <a href="/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, the name "spirit of hartshorn" was applied to ammonia.</p>
<p>Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Priestley" title="Joseph Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> in 1774 and was termed by him "alkaline air".

<p>Household ammonia is a solution of NH<sub>3</sub> in water (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_hydroxide" title="Ammonium hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a>) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10% ammonia.</p>

<p>Because of ammonia's vaporization properties, it is a useful <a href="/wiki/Refrigerant" title="Refrigerant">refrigerant</a>. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbons</a> (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high <a href="/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency" title="Energy conversion efficiency">energy efficiency</a> and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern <a href="/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration" title="Vapor-compression refrigeration">vapor-compression refrigeration</a> it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in <a href="/wiki/Absorption_refrigerator" title="Absorption refrigerator">absorption refrigerators</a>.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="For_remediation_of_gaseous_emissions">For remediation of gaseous emissions</span></h4>
<p>Ammonia is used to scrub SO<sub>2</sub> from the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR (<a href="/wiki/Selective_catalytic_reduction" title="Selective catalytic reduction">selective catalytic reduction</a>), relies on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vanadia" title="Vanadia">vanadia</a>-based catalyst.<br/>
Ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of <a href="/wiki/Phosgene" title="Phosgene">phosgene</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_fuel">As a fuel</span></h4>


<p>The raw <a href="/wiki/Energy_density" title="Energy density">energy density</a> of liquid ammonia is 11.5 MJ/L, which is about a third that of <a href="/wiki/Diesel_fuel" title="Diesel fuel">diesel</a>. Although it can be used as a fuel, for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread.</p>
<p>Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a <a href="/wiki/Working_fluid" title="Working fluid">working fluid</a>, have been proposed and occasionally used. The principle is similar to that used in a <a href="/wiki/Fireless_locomotive" title="Fireless locomotive">fireless locomotive</a>, but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by <a href="/wiki/Goldsworthy_Gurney" title="Goldsworthy Gurney">Goldsworthy Gurney</a> in the UK and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Charles_Avenue_Streetcar" title="St. Charles Avenue Streetcar">St. Charles Avenue Streetcar</a> line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s, and during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium.</p>
<p>Ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engines" title="Internal combustion engines">internal combustion engines</a>. Its high octane rating of 120 and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production.  Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.</p>
<p>However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing <a href="/wiki/Otto_cycle" title="Otto cycle">Otto cycle</a> engines because of its very narrow <a href="/wiki/Ammonia#Combustion" title="Ammonia">flammability range</a> and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage. In terms of raw ammonia supplies, plants would have to be built to increase production levels, requiring significant capital and energy sources. Although it is the second most produced chemical, the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage. It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. The 60 MW <a href="/wiki/Norsk_Hydro_Rjukan" title="Norsk Hydro Rjukan">Rjukan dam</a> in <a href="/wiki/Telemark" title="Telemark">Telemark</a>, Norway produced ammonia via electrolysis of water for many years from 1913 producing fertilizer for much of Europe.</p>
<p>Despite this, several tests have been done. In 1981, a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel. In 2007, a University of Michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from Detroit to San Francisco as part of a demonstration, requiring only one fill-up in Wyoming.</p>
<p>Compared to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen_as_a_fuel" title="Hydrogen as a fuel">hydrogen as a fuel</a>, ammonia is much more energy efficient, and it would be a much lower cost to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen as ammonia than as compressed and/or cryogenic hydrogen. The conversion of ammonia to hydrogen via the sodium-amide process, either as a catalyst for combustion or as fuel for a <a href="/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_fuel_cell" title="Proton exchange membrane fuel cell">proton exchange membrane fuel cell</a>, is another possibility.  Conversion to hydrogen would allow the storage of hydrogen at nearly 18 wt% compared to ~5% for gaseous hydrogen under pressure.</p>
<p>Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia. The <a href="/wiki/Reaction_Motors_XLR99" title="Reaction Motors XLR99">Reaction Motors XLR99</a> rocket engine that powered the <span class="nowrap"><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/X-15" title="X-15">X-15</a></span> hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lifting_gas">Lifting gas</span></h4>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Safety_precautions">Safety precautions</span></h2>

<p>The U. S. <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)</a> has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume. NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death. Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toxicity">Toxicity</span></h3>
<p>The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to <a href="/wiki/Carbamoyl_phosphate" title="Carbamoyl phosphate">carbamoyl phosphate</a> by the enzyme <a href="/wiki/Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase" title="Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase">carbamoyl phosphate synthetase</a>, and then enters the <a href="/wiki/Urea_cycle" title="Urea cycle">urea cycle</a> to be either incorporated into <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> or excreted in the urine. <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">Fish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amphibian" title="Amphibian">amphibians</a> lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Directive_67/548/EEC" title="Directive 67/548/EEC">classified</a> as <i>dangerous for the environment</i>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Coking_wastewater">Coking wastewater</span></h4>
<p>Ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams, as a liquid by-product of the production of <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a> from <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>. In some cases, the ammonia is discharged to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_environment" title="Marine environment">marine environment</a> where it acts as a pollutant. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Whyalla_steelworks" title="Whyalla steelworks">Whyalla steelworks</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Australia" title="South Australia">South Australia</a> is one example of a coke-producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aquaculture">Aquaculture</span></h4>
<p>Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.</p>
<p>During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.</p>

<p>Similar to <a href="/wiki/Propane" title="Propane">propane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anhydrous" title="Anhydrous">anhydrous</a> ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. A storage vessel capable of 250 <a href="/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" title="Pounds per square inch">psi</a> (1.7 <a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" title="Pascal (unit)">MPa</a>) is suitable to contain the liquid.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Household_use">Household use</span></h3>
<p>Solutions of ammonia (5–10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and <a href="/wiki/Mucous_membrane" title="Mucous membrane">mucous membranes</a> (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Laboratory_use_of_ammonia_solutions">Laboratory use of ammonia solutions</span></h3>

<p>The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: "dilute" ammonia solutions are usually 5–10% by weight (&lt;5.62 mol/L); "concentrated" solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm, and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Directive_67/548/EEC" title="Directive 67/548/EEC">European Union classification</a> of ammonia solutions is given in the table.</p>


<p>The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated ("0.880") solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care; this is not usually a problem for 25% ("0.900") solutions.</p>
<p>Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with <a href="/wiki/Halogen" title="Halogen">halogens</a>, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with <a href="/wiki/Silver" title="Silver">silver</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> or <a href="/wiki/Iodide" title="Iodide">iodide</a> salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in <a href="/wiki/Qualitative_inorganic_analysis" title="Qualitative inorganic analysis">qualitative inorganic analysis</a>, and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (&lt;6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Laboratory_use_of_anhydrous_ammonia_.28gas_or_liquid.29">Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid)</span></h3>
<p>Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic (<b>T</b>) and dangerous for the environment (<b>N</b>). The gas is flammable (<a href="/wiki/Autoignition_temperature" title="Autoignition temperature">autoignition temperature</a>: 651 °C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%).

<p><i>This section is about industrial synthesis. For synthesis in certain organisms, see section <a href="#Biosynthesis">§ Biosynthesis</a> below.</i></p>

<p>Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of <a href="/wiki/Chemical_plant" title="Chemical plant">chemical plants</a> worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia_production" title="Ammonia production">ammonia production</a> is a significant component of the world energy budget. The USGS reports global ammonia production in 2014 was 176 million tonnes. China accounted for 32.6% of that (increasingly from coal as part of <a href="/wiki/Urea" title="Urea">urea</a> synthesis), followed by Russia at 8.1%, India at 7.6%, and the United States at 6.4%. About 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Before the start of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, most ammonia was obtained by the <a href="/wiki/Dry_distillation" title="Dry distillation">dry distillation</a> of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including <a href="/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">camel</a> <a href="/wiki/Manure" title="Manure">dung</a>, where it was <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distilled</a> by the reduction of <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_acid" title="Nitrous acid">nitrous acid</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nitrite" title="Nitrite">nitrites</a> with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>, and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alkaline" title="Alkaline">alkaline</a> hydroxides such as <a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" title="Calcium oxide">quicklime</a>, the salt most generally used being the chloride (<a href="/wiki/Sal_ammoniac" title="Sal ammoniac">sal ammoniac</a>) thus:</p>

<p>Hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the <a href="/wiki/Water_gas" title="Water gas">water gas</a> reaction followed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_gas_shift" title="Water gas shift">water gas shift</a> reaction, produced by passing steam through red-hot <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a>, to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, followed by removal of the carbon dioxide "washing" the gas mixture with water under pressure (25 <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)" title="Atmosphere (unit)">standard atmospheres</a> (2,500 <a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" title="Pascal (unit)">kPa</a>)); or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification.</p>
<p>Modern ammonia-producing plants depend on industrial <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_production" title="Hydrogen production">hydrogen production</a> to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a <a href="/wiki/Magnetite" title="Magnetite">magnetite</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> or over a promoted Fe catalyst under high pressure (100 standard atmospheres (10,000 kPa)) and temperature (450 °C) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Haber_process" title="Haber process">Haber–Bosch process</a>):</p>

<p>Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale. At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at <a href="/wiki/Vemork" title="Vemork">Vemork</a>, via the electrolysis route. Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.</p>
<p>As a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a>, hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes (such as biomass or food-industry waste), using <a href="/wiki/Catalytic_reforming" title="Catalytic reforming">catalytic reforming</a>. This releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 10–20% of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost (allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming, such as cold-plasma). Catalytic (thermal) reforming is possible in small, distributed (even mobile) plants, to take advantage of low-value, stranded biomass/biowaste or natural gas deposits. Conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage, as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand, without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage.</p>
<p>It is also easier to store ammonia on board vehicles than to store hydrogen, as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or LPG.</p>

Comparison of the physical properties of NH<sub>3</sub> with those of water shows NH<sub>3</sub> has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dielectric_constant" title="Dielectric constant">dielectric constant</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_conductivity" title="Electrical conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH<sub>3</sub> and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH<sub>3</sub> molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H<sub>2</sub>O molecule. The ionic self-<a href="/wiki/Dissociation_constant" title="Dissociation constant">dissociation constant</a> of liquid NH<sub>3</sub> at −50 °C is about 10 mol·l.</p>

<p>The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen, <a href="/wiki/Standard_electrode_potential" title="Standard electrode potential"><i>E</i>°</a> (N<sub>2</sub> + 6NH<sub>4</sub> + 6e ⇌ 8NH<sub>3</sub>), is only +0.04 V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the <a href="/wiki/Amide" title="Amide">metal amide</a> and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.</p>

<p>Ammonia is both a <a href="/wiki/Metabolic_waste" title="Metabolic waste">metabolic waste</a> and a metabolic input throughout the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>. It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N<sub>2</sub> gas. Therefore, <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixation</a> is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing <a href="/wiki/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a>, benefit from <a href="/wiki/Symbiosis" title="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationships with <a href="/wiki/Rhizobia" title="Rhizobia">rhizobia</a> that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biosynthesis">Biosynthesis</span></h3>
<p>In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> called <a href="/wiki/Nitrogenase" title="Nitrogenase">nitrogenases</a>. The overall process is called <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>. Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods that are competitive with the <a href="/wiki/Haber_process" title="Haber process">Haber process</a> will be developed, intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe<sub>7</sub>MoS<sub>9</sub> ensemble.</p>
<p>Ammonia is also a metabolic product of <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acid</a> <a href="/wiki/Deamination" title="Deamination">deamination</a> catalyzed by enzymes such as <a href="/wiki/Glutamate_dehydrogenase_1#Function" title="Glutamate dehydrogenase 1">glutamate dehydrogenase 1</a>. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to <a href="/wiki/Urea" title="Urea">urea</a>, which is much less toxic, particularly less <a href="#Basicity">basic</a>. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a>. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete <a href="/wiki/Uric_acid" title="Uric acid">uric acid</a> solely as nitrogenous waste.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_physiology">In physiology</span></h3>
<p>Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal <a href="/wiki/Physiology" title="Physiology">physiology</a>. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the <a href="/wiki/Urea_cycle" title="Urea cycle">urea cycle</a>. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in <a href="/wiki/Cirrhosis" title="Cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (<a href="/wiki/Hyperammonemia" title="Hyperammonemia">hyperammonemia</a>). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as <a href="/wiki/Ornithine_transcarbamylase" title="Ornithine transcarbamylase">ornithine transcarbamylase</a>, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and <a href="/wiki/Coma" title="Coma">coma</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy" title="Hepatic encephalopathy">hepatic encephalopathy</a>, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_aciduria" title="Organic aciduria">organic acidurias</a>.</p>
<p>Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from <a href="/wiki/Glutamine" title="Glutamine">glutamine</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%CE%91-ketoglutarate" title="Α-ketoglutarate">α-ketoglutarate</a> may be degraded to produce two molecules of <a href="/wiki/Bicarbonate" title="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a>, which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interstellar_space">Interstellar space</span></h3>
<p>Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on <a href="/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwave</a> emissions from the direction of the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">galactic core</a>. This was the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyatomic" title="Polyatomic">polyatomic</a> molecule to be so detected. The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_cloud" title="Molecular cloud">molecular clouds</a>. The relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium.</p>
<p>The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:</p>

<p>The detection of triply <a href="/wiki/Deuterium" title="Deuterium">deuterated</a> ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.</p>
<p>Since its interstellar discovery, NH<sub>3</sub> has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium. With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions, NH<sub>3</sub> has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles. Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia.</p>
<p>The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades. Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interstellar_formation_mechanisms">Interstellar formation mechanisms</span></h4>

<p>The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments. The [NH<sub>3</sub>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] ratio has been estimated to range from 10 in small dark clouds up to 10 in the dense core of the <a href="/wiki/Orion_Molecular_Cloud_Complex" title="Orion Molecular Cloud Complex">Orion Molecular Cloud Complex</a>. Although a total of 18 total production routes have been proposed, the principal formation mechanism for interstellar NH<sub>3</sub> is the reaction:</p>

<p>The rate constant, <i>k</i>, of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment, with a value of 5.2×10 at 10 K. The rate constant was calculated from the formula <i>k = a(T/300)</i>. For the primary formation reaction, <i>a</i> = 1.05×10 and <i>B</i> = −0.47. Assuming an NH<sub>4</sub> abundance of 3×10 and an electron abundance of 10 typical of molecular clouds, the formation will proceed at a rate of 1.6×10 cms in a molecular cloud of total density 10 cm.</p>
<p>All other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller, making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant. As an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play, the reaction:</p>

<p>has a rate constant of 2.2×10. Assuming H<sub>2</sub> densities of 10 and NH<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> ratio of 10, this reaction proceeds at a rate of 2.2×10, more than 3 orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above.</p>
<p>Some of the other possible formation reactions are:</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interstellar_destruction_mechanisms">Interstellar destruction mechanisms</span></h4>
<p>There are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of NH<sub>3</sub>. Of these, 39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among C, N, and O compounds. A review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms:</p>

<p>with rate constants of 4.39×10 and 2.2×10, respectively. The above equations (1,2) run at a rate of 8.8×10 and 4.4×10, respectively. These calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of [NH<sub>3</sub>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] = 10, [H<sub>3</sub>]/[H<sub>2</sub>] = 2×10, [HCO]/[H<sub>2</sub>] = 2×10, and total densities of n = 10, typical of cold, dense, molecular clouds. Clearly, between these two primary reactions, equation (1) is the dominant destruction reaction, with a rate ~10,000 times faster than equation (2). This is due to the relatively high abundance of H<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Single_antenna_detections">Single antenna detections</span></h4>
<p>Radio observations of NH<sub>3</sub> from the <a href="/wiki/Effelsberg_100-m_Radio_Telescope" title="Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope">Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope</a> reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO. The 25 m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in <a href="/wiki/H_II_region" title="H II region">H II regions</a>, HNH<sub>2</sub>O <a href="/wiki/Maser" title="Maser">masers</a>, H-H objects, and other objects associated with star formation. A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.</p>
<p>Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), <a href="/wiki/Orion_(constellation)" title="Orion (constellation)">Orion A</a>, W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre. The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interferometric_studies">Interferometric studies</span></h4>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Very_Large_Array" title="Very Large Array">VLA</a> observations of NH<sub>3</sub> in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1 <a href="/wiki/Parsec" title="Parsec">pc</a> in L1551, S140, and <a href="/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation)" title="Cepheus (constellation)">Cepheus A</a>. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.</p>
<p>Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in <a href="/wiki/IC_342" title="IC 342">IC 342</a>. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO. NH<sub>3</sub> was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96-0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Infrared_detections">Infrared detections</span></h4>
<p>Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Becklin-Neugebauer_Object" title="Becklin-Neugebauer Object">Becklin-Neugebauer Object</a> and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.</p>
<p>A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the <a href="/wiki/Kuiper_Airborne_Observatory" title="Kuiper Airborne Observatory">Kuiper Airborne Observatory</a>, covering the 100 to 300 cm spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.</p>
<p>A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH<sub>3</sub>. In general, the cores are not spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.</p>
<p>Ammonia has been detected in the <a href="/wiki/Draco_(constellation)" title="Draco (constellation)">Draco Nebula</a> and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic <a href="/wiki/Infrared_cirrus" title="Infrared cirrus">infrared cirrus</a>. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Observations_of_nearby_dark_clouds">Observations of nearby dark clouds</span></h4>
<p>By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between <a href="/wiki/Excitation_temperature" title="Excitation temperature">excitation temperature</a> and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10 and 10 cm in dark clouds. Mapping of NH<sub>3</sub> gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 <a href="/wiki/Parsec" title="Parsec">pc</a> and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="UC_HII_regions">UC HII regions</span></h4>
<p>Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Extragalactic_detection">Extragalactic detection</span></h4>
<p>Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies, and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (~50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy—hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).</p>
