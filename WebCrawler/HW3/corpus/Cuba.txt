<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The name <i>Cuba</i> comes from the <a href="/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_language" title="Taíno language">Taíno language</a>. The exact meaning of the name is unclear but it may be translated either as 'where fertile land is abundant' (<i>cubao</i>), or 'great place' (<i>coabana</i>). Authors who believe that <a href="/wiki/Origin_theories_of_Christopher_Columbus" title="Origin theories of Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus was Portuguese</a> state that <i>Cuba</i> was named by Columbus for the <a href="/wiki/Cuba,_Portugal" title="Cuba, Portugal">town of Cuba</a> in the district of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beja_(Portugal)" title="Beja (Portugal)">Beja</a> in <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prehistory">Prehistory</span></h3>

<p>Before the arrival of the Spanish, Cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indigenous_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous of the Americas">American Indian</a> people. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people" title="Taíno people">Taíno</a> (an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arawak_peoples" title="Arawak peoples">Arawak</a> people), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guanajatabey" title="Guanajatabey">Guanajatabey</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ciboney_people" title="Ciboney people">Ciboney people</a>.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland of South America, with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 BP.</p>
<p>The Taíno arrived from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hispanola" title="Hispanola">Hispanola</a> sometime in the 3rd century A.D. When Columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in Cuba, having an estimated population of 150,000.</p>
<p>The name "Cuba" comes from the native Taíno language. It is derived from either <i>coabana</i> meaning "great place," or from <i>cubao</i> meaning "where fertile land is abundant".</p>
<p>The Taíno were farmers, while the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a>.</p>

<p>After first landing on an island then called <a href="/wiki/Guanahani" title="Guanahani">Guanahani</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> on October 12, 1492, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> commanded his three ships: <i>La Pinta,</i> <i>La Niña</i> and the <i>Santa María,</i> to land on Cuba's northeastern coast on October 28, 1492. (This was near what is now Bariay, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holguin_province" title="Holguin province">Holguin province</a>.) Columbus claimed the island for the new Kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> and named it <i>Isla Juana</i> after <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Juan,_Prince_of_Asturias" title="Juan, Prince of Asturias">Juan, Prince of Asturias</a>.</p>

<p>In 1511, the first Spanish settlement was founded by <a href="/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_de_Cu%C3%A9llar" title="Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar">Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar</a> at <a href="/wiki/Baracoa" title="Baracoa">Baracoa</a>. Other towns soon followed, including <a href="/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">San Cristobal de la Habana</a>, founded in 1515, which later became the capital. The native Taíno were forced to work under the <a href="/wiki/Encomienda" title="Encomienda">encomienda</a> system, which resembled a feudal system in Medieval Europe. Within a century the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to multiple factors, primarily Eurasian <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infectious_disease" title="Infectious disease">infectious diseases</a>, to which they had no natural resistance (immunity), aggravated by harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation. In 1529, a <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of those few natives who had previously survived <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>.</p>
<p>On May 18, 1539, Conquistador <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hernando_De_Soto" title="Hernando De Soto">Hernando De Soto</a> departed from Havana, Cuba at the head of some 600 followers into a vast expedition through the Southeastern United States, starting at La <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, in search of gold, treasure, fame and power. On September 1, 1548, Dr. Gonzalo Perez de Angulo was appointed governor of Cuba. He arrived in Santiago, Cuba on November 4, 1549 and immediately declared the liberty of all natives. He became Cuba's first permanent governor to reside in Havana instead of Santiago, and he built Havana's first church made of masonry. After the French took Havana in 1555, the governor's son, Francisco de Angulo, went to Mexico.</p>
<p>Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in <a href="/wiki/Barbados" title="Barbados">Barbados</a>; 300,000 in <a href="/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia" title="Colony of Virginia">Virginia</a>, both British colonies; and 450,000 in French <a href="/wiki/Saint-Domingue" title="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a>, which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a>, which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Havana_(1762)" title="Battle of Havana (1762)">a British expedition</a> of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> to capture Cuba. The British arrived on June 6, and by August had Havana under <a href="/wiki/Siege" title="Siege">siege</a>. When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, <a href="/wiki/George_Keppel,_3rd_Earl_of_Albemarle" title="George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle">George Keppel</a>, the 3rd <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Albemarle" title="Earl of Albemarle">Earl of Albemarle</a>, entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the under developed sugar plantations.</p>

<p>Though Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)" title="Treaty of Paris (1763)">Peace of Paris</a> together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British. Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain_in_the_Seven_Years%27_War" title="Great Britain in the Seven Years' War">Britain's other gains in the war</a>.</p>
<p>The real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Revolution" title="Haitian Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a>. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing "pearl of the Antilles" that Haiti had been before the revolution. As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, "At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba. As slavery and colonialism collapsed in the French colony, the Spanish island underwent transformations that were almost the mirror image of Haiti's." Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820 some 325,000 Africans were imported to Cuba as slaves, which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.</p>

<p>Although a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved, at times slaves arose in revolt. In 1812 the Aponte Slave Rebellion took place but it was suppressed.</p>
<p>The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980, of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 <a href="/wiki/Free_people_of_color" title="Free people of color">free people of color</a> (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves. This was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in <a href="/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, for instance, or the other Caribbean islands. Historians such as Swedish Magnus Mõrner, who studied slavery in Latin America, found that <a href="/wiki/Manumission" title="Manumission">manumissions</a> increased when slave economies were in decline, as in 18th-century Cuba and early 19th-century Maryland of the United States.</p>
<p>In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, there had developed the practice of <i>coartacion,</i> or "buying oneself out of slavery," a "uniquely Cuban development," according to historian Herbert S. Klein. Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers." A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.</p>
<p>In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal. Its economy was based on serving the empire. By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color, 39% of its non-White population of 550,000. By contrast, Virginia with about the same number of blacks, had only 58,042 or 11% who were free; the rest were enslaved. In the antebellum years, Virginia discouraged manumissions after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_Slave_Rebellion" title="Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion">Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion</a> of 1831 and strengthened restrictions against free blacks, as did other southern states. In addition, there was a high demand for slaves, and Virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade, to be shipped or taken overland to the Deep South, which had greatly expanded its cotton production.</p>

<p>Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Manuel_de_C%C3%A9spedes" title="Carlos Manuel de Céspedes">Carlos Manuel de Céspedes</a>. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. On December 27, 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service. The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Years%27_War" title="Ten Years' War">Ten Years' War</a>. Two thousand Cuban Chinese joined the rebels. Chinese had been imported as indentured laborers. A monument in Havana honours the Cuban Chinese who fell in the war.</p>
<p>The United States declined to recognize the new Cuban government, although many European and Latin American nations did so. In 1878, the <a href="/wiki/Pact_of_Zanj%C3%B3n" title="Pact of Zanjón">Pact of Zanjón</a> ended the conflict, with Spain promising greater autonomy to Cuba. In 1879–1880, Cuban patriot <a href="/wiki/Calixto_Garc%C3%ADa" title="Calixto García">Calixto García</a> attempted to start another war known as the <a href="/wiki/Little_War_(Cuba)" title="Little War (Cuba)">Little War</a> but did not receive enough support. <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_Cuba" title="Slavery in Cuba">Slavery in Cuba</a> was abolished in 1875 and was completed in 1886.</p>
<p>An exiled dissident named <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD" title="José Martí">José Martí</a> founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> in 1892. The aim of the party was to achieve Cuban independence from Spain. In January 1895 Martí traveled to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Fernando_de_Monte_Cristi" title="San Fernando de Monte Cristi">Montecristi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Santo_Domingo" title="Santo Domingo">Santo Domingo</a> to join the efforts of <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A1ximo_G%C3%B3mez" title="Máximo Gómez">Máximo Gómez</a>. Martí recorded his political views in the <i><a href="/wiki/Manifesto_of_Montecristi" title="Manifesto of Montecristi">Manifesto of Montecristi</a></i>. Fighting against the Spanish army began in Cuba on February 24, 1895, but Martí was unable to reach Cuba until April 11, 1895. Martí was killed in the battle of Dos Rios on May 19, 1895. His death immortalized him as Cuba's national hero.</p>

<p>Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guerrilla" title="Guerrilla">guerrilla</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sabotage" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a> tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression. General <a href="/wiki/Valeriano_Weyler" title="Valeriano Weyler">Valeriano Weyler</a>, military governor of Cuba, herded the rural population into what he called <i>reconcentrados</i>, described by international observers as "fortified towns". These are often considered the prototype for 20th-century <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a>. Between 200,000 and 400,000 Cuban civilians died from starvation and disease in the camps, numbers verified by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_Cross" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> and United States Senator <a href="/wiki/Redfield_Proctor" title="Redfield Proctor">Redfield Proctor</a>, a former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War" title="United States Secretary of War">Secretary of War</a>. American and European protests against Spanish conduct on the island followed.</p>
<p>The U.S. battleship <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)" title="USS Maine (ACR-1)">Maine</a></i> was sent to protect U.S. interests, but soon after arrival, she exploded in Havana harbor and sank quickly, killing nearly three quarters of her crew. The cause and responsibility for her sinking remained unclear after a board of inquiry. Popular opinion in the U.S., fueled by an active press, concluded that the Spanish were to blame and demanded action. Spain and the United States declared war on each other in late April 1898.</p>

Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, as the Republic of Cuba. Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the <a href="/wiki/Platt_Amendment" title="Platt Amendment">Platt Amendment</a>, the U.S. leased the <a href="/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay" title="Guantánamo Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a> naval base from Cuba.</p>

The U.S. intervened by occupying Cuba and named <a href="/wiki/Charles_Edward_Magoon" title="Charles Edward Magoon">Charles Edward Magoon</a> as Governor for three years. Cuban historians have characterized Magoon's governorship as having introduced political and social corruption. In 1908, self-government was restored when <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Miguel_G%C3%B3mez" title="José Miguel Gómez">José Miguel Gómez</a> was elected President, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs.

<p>In 1924, <a href="/wiki/Gerardo_Machado" title="Gerardo Machado">Gerardo Machado</a> was elected president. During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and American-owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists. The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution. The <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a> led to a collapse in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression.

A general strike (in which the Communist Party sided with Machado), uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Manuel_de_C%C3%A9spedes_y_Quesada" title="Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada">Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada</a>.</p>

A five-member executive committee (the <a href="/wiki/Pentarchy_of_1933" title="Pentarchy of 1933">Pentarchy of 1933</a>) was chosen to head a provisional government. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ramon_Grau_San_Martin" title="Ramon Grau San Martin">Ramon Grau San Martin</a> was then appointed as provisional president. Grau resigned in 1934, leaving the way clear for Batista, who dominated Cuban politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents. The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of "virtually unremitting social and political warfare".</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/1940_Constitution_of_Cuba" title="1940 Constitution of Cuba">new constitution</a> was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labour and health care. Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944. He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office. His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration. Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War II, although president Batista suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spanish_State" title="Spanish State">Francoist Spain</a> in order to overthrow its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Authoritarian" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> regime.</p>
<p>Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election. Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944. Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme Court. <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Pr%C3%ADo_Socarr%C3%A1s" title="Carlos Prío Socarrás">Carlos Prío Socarrás</a>, a protégé of Grau, became president in 1948. The two terms of the Auténtico Party saw an influx of investment which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas.</p>

<p>After running unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952, Batista staged a coup. He outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952. After the coup, Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption.</p>
<p>In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards. On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change. In 1956, <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht <a href="/wiki/Granma_(yacht)" title="Granma (yacht)"><i>Granma</i></a> in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government. It was not until 1958 that Castro's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/July_26th_Movement" title="July 26th Movement">July 26th Movement</a> emerged as the leading revolutionary group.</p>
<p>By late 1958 the rebels had broken out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general popular insurrection. After Castro's fighters captured <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clara,_Cuba" title="Santa Clara, Cuba">Santa Clara</a>, Batista fled with his family to the Dominican Republic on January 1, 1959. Later he went into exile on the Portuguese island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril, near Lisbon. Fidel Castro's forces entered the capital on January 8, 1959. The liberal <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Urrutia_Lle%C3%B3" title="Manuel Urrutia Lleó">Manuel Urrutia Lleó</a> became the provisional president.</p>
<p>From 1959 to 1966 Cuban insurgents fought a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_against_the_Bandits" title="War against the Bandits">six-year rebellion</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Escambray_Mountains" title="Escambray Mountains">Escambray Mountains</a> against the Castro government. The government's vastly superior numbers eventually crushed the insurgency. The rebellion lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the Cuban Revolution. The U.S. State Department has estimated that 3,200 people were executed from 1959 to 1962. According to <a href="/wiki/Amnesty_International" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, death sentences from 1959–87 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were actually carried out. Other estimates for the total number of political executions range from 4,000 to 33,000. The vast majority of those executed following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the Cuban population.</p>

<p>The United States government initially reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America. Castro's legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. The promulgation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agrarian_Reform_Laws_of_Cuba" title="Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba">Agrarian Reform Law</a>, expropriating thousands of acres of farmland (including from large U.S. landholders), further worsened relations. In response, between 1960 and 1964 the U.S imposed a range of sanctions, eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all Cuban-owned assets in the U.S. In February 1960, Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier <a href="/wiki/Anastas_Mikoyan" title="Anastas Mikoyan">Anastas Mikoyan</a>.</p>
<p>In March 1960, Eisenhower gave his approval to a CIA plan to arm and train a group of Cuban refugees to overthrow the Castro regime. The invasion (known as the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion" title="Bay of Pigs Invasion">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a>) took place on April 14, 1961. About 1,400 Cuban exiles disembarked at the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs" title="Bay of Pigs">Bay of Pigs</a>, but failed in their attempt to overthrow Castro.</p>
<p>In January 1962, Cuba was suspended from the <a href="/wiki/Organization_of_American_States" title="Organization of American States">Organization of American States</a> (OAS), and later the same year the OAS started to impose sanctions against Cuba of similar nature to the US sanctions. The <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> occurred in October 1962. By 1963, Cuba was moving towards a full-fledged Communist system modeled on the USSR.</p>

<p>During the 1970s, Fidel Castro dispatched tens of thousands of troops in support of Soviet-supported wars in Africa. He supported the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Popular_Movement_for_the_Liberation_of_Angola" title="Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola">MPLA</a> in <a href="/wiki/Angola" title="Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mengistu_Haile_Mariam" title="Mengistu Haile Mariam">Mengistu Haile Mariam</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>.</p>
<p>The standard of living in the 1970s was "extremely spartan" and discontent was rife. Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech. In 1975 the OAS lifted its sanctions against Cuba, with the approval of 16 member states, including the U.S. The U.S., however, maintained its own sanctions.</p>
<p>Castro's rule was severely tested in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse in 1991 (known in Cuba as the <a href="/wiki/Special_Period" title="Special Period">Special Period</a>). The country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies worth <span class="nowrap">$4 billion</span> to <span class="nowrap">$6 billion</span> annually, resulting in effects such as food and fuel shortages. The government did not accept American donations of food, medicines, and cash until 1993. On August 5, 1994, state security dispersed protesters in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maleconazo_uprising" title="Maleconazo uprising">spontaneous protest</a> in Havana.</p>

<p>Cuba has found a new source of aid and support in the People's Republic of China. <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez" title="Hugo Chávez">Hugo Chávez</a>, former <a href="/wiki/President_of_Venezuela" title="President of Venezuela">President of Venezuela</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Evo_Morales" title="Evo Morales">Evo Morales</a>, <a href="/wiki/President_of_Bolivia" title="President of Bolivia">President of Bolivia</a>, have become allies and both countries are major oil and gas exporters. In 2003, the government arrested and imprisoned a large number of civil activists, a period known as the <a href="/wiki/Black_Spring_(Cuba)" title="Black Spring (Cuba)">"Black Spring"</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2008, Fidel Castro announced his resignation as President of Cuba. On February 24 his brother, <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" title="Raúl Castro">Raúl Castro</a>, was declared the new President. In his inauguration speech, Raúl promised that some of the restrictions on freedom in Cuba would be removed. In March 2009, Raúl Castro removed some of <a href="/wiki/2009_Cuban_government_dismissals" title="2009 Cuban government dismissals">his brother's appointees</a>.</p>
<p>On June 3, 2009, the <a href="/wiki/Organization_of_American_States" title="Organization of American States">Organization of American States</a> adopted a resolution to end the 47-year ban on Cuban membership of the group. The resolution stated, however, that full membership would be delayed until Cuba was "in conformity with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS." Fidel Castro restated his position that he was not interested in joining after the OAS resolution had been announced.</p>

<p>Effective January 14, 2013, Cuba ended the requirement established in 1961, that any citizens who wish to travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation. In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution; it approved exit visas only on rare occasions. Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and they are allowed to take their young children with them for the first time. However, a passport costs on average five months' salary. Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad are most likely to be able to take advantage of the new policy. In the first year of the program, over 180,000 left Cuba and returned.</p>
<p>As of December 2014, talks with Cuban officials and American officials including President Barack Obama have resulted in the exchange of releasing Alan Gross, fifty-two political prisoners, and an unnamed non-citizen agent of the United States in return for the release of three Cuban agents currently imprisoned in the United States. Additionally, while the embargo between the United States and Cuba will not be immediately lifted, it will be relaxed to allow import, export, and certain commerce within a limit between the two.</p>

<p>Cuba's national legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power (<i>Asamblea Nacional de Poder Popular</i>), is the supreme organ of power; 609 members serve five-year terms. The assembly meets twice a year; between sessions legislative power is held by the 31 member Council of Ministers. Candidates for the Assembly are approved by public referendum. All Cuban citizens over 16 who have not been convicted of a criminal offense can vote. Article 131 of the Constitution states that voting shall be "through free, equal and secret vote". Article 136 states: "In order for deputies or delegates to be considered elected they must get more than half the number of valid votes cast in the electoral districts".</p>
<p>No <a href="/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Cuba" title="List of political parties in Cuba">political party</a> is permitted to nominate candidates or campaign on the island, including the Communist Party. The Communist Party of Cuba has held six party congress meetings since 1975. In 2011, the party stated that there were 800,000 members, and representatives generally constitute at least half of the Councils of state and the National Assembly. The remaining positions are filled by candidates nominally without party affiliation. Other political parties campaign and raise finances internationally, while activity within Cuba by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opposition_to_Fidel_Castro" title="Opposition to Fidel Castro">opposition groups</a> is minimal.</p>
<p>In February 2013, Raúl Castro, current Cuban President, announced his resignation for 2018, that will end his current 5-year term, and hope to implement permanent term limits for future Cuban Presidents, including age limits.</p>

<p>Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the most advanced and successful countries in Latin America. Cuba's capital, Havana, was a "glittering and dynamic city". The country's economy in the early part of the century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy. Cuba ranked 5th in the hemisphere in per capita income, 3rd in life expectancy, 2nd in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, and 1st in the number of television sets per inhabitant. Cuba's literacy rate, 76%, was the fourth highest in Latin America. Cuba also ranked 11th in the world in the number of doctors per capita. Several private clinics and hospitals provided services for the poor. Cuba's income distribution compared favorably with that of other Latin American societies. However, income inequality was a profound issue between city and countryside, especially between whites and blacks. Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside. A thriving middle class, according to PBS, held the promise of prosperity and social mobility. According to Cuba historian Louis Perez of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, "Havana was then what Las Vegas has become."</p>

<p>After the Cuban revolution and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its exports. The removal of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid depression known in Cuba as the <a href="/wiki/Special_Period" title="Special Period">Special Period</a>. Cuba took limited free market-oriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. These steps included allowing some self-employment in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors, the legalization of the use of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_dollar" title="US dollar">US dollar</a> in business, and the encouragement of <a href="/wiki/Tourism_in_Cuba" title="Tourism in Cuba">tourism</a>. Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system (the <i><a href="/wiki/Organop%C3%B3nicos" title="Organopónicos">organopónicos</a></i>) to compensate for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union. It's widely viewed that the <a href="/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba" title="United States embargo against Cuba">U.S. embargo</a> which initiated as a result of discontent with nationalization of U.S.-citizen-held property and later perceived human rights violations hurts the Cuban economy. In 2009, the Cuban Government estimated they lose $685 million annually from the US embargo.</p>
<p>The leadership of Cuba has called for reforms in the country's <a href="/wiki/Agriculture_in_Cuba" title="Agriculture in Cuba">agricultural system</a>. In 2008, Raúl Castro began enacting agrarian reforms to boost food production, as at that time 80% of food was imported. The reforms enacted are aimed at expanding land usage and increasing efficiency. Venezuela supplies Cuba with an estimated 110,000 barrels (17,000 m) a day of oil in exchange for money and the services of some 44,000 Cubans, most of them medical personnel, in Venezuela. Estimates place Venezuelan assistance at over 20% of the Cuban GDP for 2008–2010, similar to the aid flows from the Soviet Union in 1985–1988.</p>

<p>In 2005, Cuba had exports of <span class="nowrap">US$2.4 billion</span>, ranking 114 of 226 world countries, and imports of <span class="nowrap">US$6.9 billion</span>, ranking 87 of 226 countries. Its major export partners are Canada 17.7%, China 16.9%, <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> 12.5%, <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> 9%, and Spain 5.9% (2012). Cuba's major exports are sugar, nickel, tobacco, fish, medical products, citrus fruits, and coffee; imports include food, fuel, clothing, and machinery. Cuba presently holds debt in an amount estimated to be <span class="nowrap">$13 billion</span>, approximately 38% of GDP. According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heritage_Foundation" title="Heritage Foundation">Heritage Foundation</a>, Cuba is dependent on credit accounts that rotate from country to country. Cuba's prior 35% supply of the world's export market for sugar has declined to 10% due to a variety of factors, including a global sugar commodity price drop that made Cuba less competitive on world markets. It was announced in 2008 that wage caps would be abandoned to improve the nation's productivity.</p>
<p>In 2010, Cubans were allowed to build their own houses. According to Raúl Castro, they will be able to improve their houses with this new permission, but the government will not endorse these new houses or improvements. There is virtually no homelessness in Cuba, and 85% of Cubans own their own homes and pay no property taxes or interest on their mortgages. Mortgage payments can’t exceed 10% of the combined household income.</p>
<p>On August 2, 2011, <i>The New York Times</i> reported Cuba as reaffirming their intent to legalize "buying and selling" of private property before the year's end. According to experts, the private sale of property could "transform Cuba more than any of the economic reforms announced by President Raúl Castro's government". It will cut more than one million state jobs, including party bureaucrats who resist the changes. The new economic reforms effectively created a new economic system, referred by some as the "New Cuban Economy". In October 2013, Raul said he intends to merge the two currencies. As of August 2016, the dual currency system remains in force.</p>
<p>In August 2012, a specialist of the "Cubaenergia Company" announced the opening of Cuba's first Solar Power Plant. As a member of the Cubasolar Group, there was also a mention of 10 additional plants in 2013.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Resources">Resources</span></h3>
<p>Cuba's natural resources include sugar, tobacco, fish, citrus fruits, <a href="/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Cuba" title="Coffee production in Cuba">coffee</a>, beans, rice, potatoes, and livestock. The output of Cuba's nickel mines that year was 71,000 tons, approaching 4% of world production. As of 2013 its reserves were estimated at 5.5 million tons, over 7% of the world total. <a href="/wiki/Sherritt_International" title="Sherritt International">Sherritt International</a> of Canada operates a large nickel mining facility in <a href="/wiki/Moa,_Cuba" title="Moa, Cuba">Moa</a>. Cuba is also a major producer of refined <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a>, a by-product of nickel mining operations.</p>
<p>Oil exploration in 2005 by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey" title="United States Geological Survey">US Geological Survey</a> revealed that the North Cuba Basin could produce approximately 4.6 billion barrels (730,000,000 m) to 9.3 billion barrels (1.48<span style="margin:0 .15em 0 .25em">×</span>10 m) of oil. In 2006, Cuba started to test-drill these locations for possible exploitation.</p>

<p>Tourism was initially restricted to enclave resorts where tourists would be segregated from Cuban society, referred to as "enclave tourism" and "tourism apartheid". Contacts between foreign visitors and ordinary Cubans were <i>de facto</i> illegal between 1992 and 1997. The rapid growth of tourism during the Special Period had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba, and led to speculation about the emergence of a two-tier economy.</p>
<p>Cuba has tripled its market share of Caribbean tourism in the last decade; as a result of significant investment in tourism infrastructure, this growth rate is predicted to continue. <span class="nowrap">1.9 million</span> tourists visited Cuba in 2003, predominantly from Canada and the European Union, generating revenue of <span class="nowrap">US$2.1 billion</span>. Cuba recorded 2,688,000 international tourists in 2011, the third-highest figure in the Caribbean (behind the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Medical_tourism" title="Medical tourism">medical tourism</a> sector caters to thousands of European, Latin American, Canadian, and American consumers every year.</p>
<p>Allegations of widespread <a href="/wiki/Sex_tourism" title="Sex tourism">sex tourism</a> are downplayed by the Cuban Justice minister. According to a Government of Canada travel advice website, "Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists, including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years."</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> is 77 km (48 mi) to the east, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> (140 km/87 mi) and the <a href="/wiki/Cayman_Islands" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a> to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the <a href="/wiki/Colorados_Archipelago" title="Colorados Archipelago">Colorados Archipelago</a> on the northwestern coast, the <a href="/wiki/Sabana-Camag%C3%BCey_Archipelago" title="Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago">Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago</a> on the north-central Atlantic coast, the <a href="/wiki/Jardines_de_la_Reina" title="Jardines de la Reina">Jardines de la Reina</a> on the south-central coast and the <a href="/wiki/Canarreos_Archipelago" title="Canarreos Archipelago">Canarreos Archipelago</a> on the southwestern coast.</p>

<p>The main island, named Cuba, is 1,250 km (780 mi) long, constituting most of the nation's land area (104,556 km (40,369 sq mi)) and is the largest island in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area" title="List of islands by area">17th-largest island</a> in the world by land area.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_of_Cuba" title="Climate of Cuba">Climate of Cuba</a></div>

<p>With most of the island south of the <a href="/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer" title="Tropic of Cancer">Tropic of Cancer</a>, the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is 21 °C (69.8 °F) in January and 27 °C (80.6 °F) in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> combine to make the country prone to frequent <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricanes</a>. These are most common in September and October.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biodiversity">Biodiversity</span></h3>
<p>Cuba signed the Rio <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="Convention on Biological Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> on June 12, 1992, and became a party to the convention on March 8, 1994. It has subsequently produced a <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity_action_plan" title="Biodiversity action plan">National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan</a>, with one revision which was received by the convention on January 24, 2008.</p>
<p>The revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item, and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery. There is, however, virtually no information in that document about biodiversity itself. The country's fourth national report to the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="Convention on Biological Diversity">CBD</a>, however, contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: <a href="/wiki/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a> (17,801 species), <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> (270 species), <a href="/wiki/Chromista" title="Chromista">chromista</a> (707 species), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Lichen" title="Lichen">lichen</a>-forming species (5844 species), <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a> (9107 species) and <a href="/wiki/Protozoa" title="Protozoa">protozoa</a> (1440 species).</p>
<p>As elsewhere in the world, vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented. The numbers recorded from Cuba for those groups are therefore likely to be close to the numbers which actually occur in Cuba. For most if not all of the other groups, however, the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed, often considerably, the numbers of those recorded so far.</p>

<div class="barbox tright" style="border:1px solid silver; font-size:88%; padding:0.4em; width:auto; background: white;">

</div>

<p>According to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women. Its <a href="/wiki/Birth_rate" title="Birth rate">birth rate</a> (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006) is one of the lowest in the <a href="/wiki/Western_Hemisphere" title="Western Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. Although the country has grown by around 4 million people since 1961, the rate of increase had simultaneously began to fall during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, with a fertility rate of 1.43 children per woman.</p>
<p>Indeed, this drop in fertility is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere, and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion: Cuba's abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996, compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean, 27 in Latin America overall, and 48 in Europe. Similarly, the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contraception" title="Contraception">contraceptives</a> is also widespread, estimated at 79% of the female population (in the upper third of countries in the Western Hemisphere).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethnoracial_groups">Ethnoracial groups</span></h3>
<p>Cuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Miami" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a> determined that 62% of Cubans are black, the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="/wiki/Minority_Rights_Group_International" title="Minority Rights Group International">Minority Rights Group International</a> determined that "An objective assessment of the situation of <a href="/wiki/Afro-Cuban" title="Afro-Cuban">Afro-Cubans</a> remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 34% to 62%".</p>
<p>An study from 2014 found the <a href="/wiki/Autosome" title="Autosome">autosomal</a> genetic ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American; 35% of maternal lineages derived from Cuban Native Americans, compared to 39% from Africa and 26% from Europe, but male lineages were exclusively European (82%) and African (18%), indicating the historical bias towards mating between foreign men and native women rather than the inverse.</p>

<p>Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canarian_people" title="Canarian people">Canarian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catalans" title="Catalans">Catalan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andalusians" title="Andalusians">Andalusian</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galician_people" title="Galician people">Galician</a>, and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. Between 1899-1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain. Other prominent immigrant groups included French, <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_people" title="Portuguese people">Portuguese</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Italian_people" title="Italian people">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russians" title="Russians">Russian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greeks" title="Greeks">Greek</a>, <a href="/wiki/British_people" title="British people">British</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a>, as well as small number of descendants of U.S. citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>Post-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exile" title="Cuban exile">large and influential diaspora community</a>. During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes — constituting 10% of the total population — <a href="/wiki/Cuban_migration_to_Miami" title="Cuban migration to Miami">emigrated to the United States</a>, a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. from the Caribbean as a whole during that period. Other common destinations include Spain, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cubans_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Cubans in the United Kingdom">the United Kingdom</a>, Canada, <a href="/wiki/Cuban_immigration_to_Mexico" title="Cuban immigration to Mexico">Mexico</a>, and Sweden, among others. Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts. On September 9, 1994, the U.S. and Cuban governments agreed that the U.S. would grant at least 20,000 visas annually in exchange for Cuba's pledge to prevent further unlawful departures on boats.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_Cuba" title="Religion in Cuba">Religion in Cuba</a></div>

<p>In 2010, the religious affiliation of the country was estimated by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pew_Forum" title="Pew Forum">Pew Forum</a> to be 65% Christian (60% <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> or about 6.9 million in 2016, 5% <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Evangelical" title="Evangelical">Evangelical</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> or about 575,000 in 2016), 23% unaffiliated, 17% <a href="/wiki/Folk_religion" title="Folk religion">folk religion</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa" title="Santería">santería</a>), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions.</p>
<p>Cuba is officially a secular state. Religious freedom increased through the 1980s, with the government amending the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> is the largest religion, with its origins rooted in Spanish colonization. Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics in 2006, it nonetheless remains the dominant faith. Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 1998 and 2011, respectively, and Pope Francis visited Cuba in September 2015. Prior to each papal visit, the Cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture.</p>
<p>The government's relaxation of restrictions on <a href="/wiki/House_church" title="House church">house churches</a> in the 1990s led to "an explosion of <a href="/wiki/Pentecostalism" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostalism</a>", with some groups claiming as many as 100,000 members.

<p>The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Syncretisms" title="Syncretisms">syncretisms</a> of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with <a href="/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa" title="Santería">Santería</a>, a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of <i>Cobre</i>) is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess <a href="/wiki/Oshun" title="Oshun">Oshun</a>.</p>
<p>Cuba also hosts small communities of <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a> (500 in 2012), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Muslims" title="Muslims">Muslims</a>, and members of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD" title="Bahá'í">Bahá'í</a> Faith.</p>

The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tres_(musical_instrument)" title="Tres (musical instrument)">Tres</a> was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute).

Havana was the heart of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rap" title="Rap">rap</a> scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.</p>
<p>During that time, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reggaet%C3%B3n" title="Reggaetón">reggaetón</a> was growing in popularity.

Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor.

<p>Cuba's <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> at birth is 78 years. Historically, Cuba has ranked high in numbers of medical personnel and has made significant contributions to world health since the 19th century. Today, Cuba has <a href="/wiki/Universal_health_care" title="Universal health care">universal health care</a> and although shortages of medical supplies persist, there is no shortage of medical personnel. Primary care is available throughout the island and infant and maternal mortality rates compare favorably with those in developed nations.</p>
<p>Post-Revolution Cuba initially experienced an overall worsening in terms of disease and infant mortality rates in the 1960s when half its 6,000 doctors left the country. Recovery occurred by the 1980s, and the country's healthcare has been widely praised. The Communist government asserted that universal health care was to become a priority of state planning and progress was made in rural areas. Like the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Cuba" title="Economy of Cuba">Cuban economy</a>, Cuban medical care suffered from severe material shortages following the end of Soviet subsidies in 1991, followed by a tightening of the U.S. embargo in 1992.</p>
<p>Challenges include low salaries for doctors, poor facilities, poor provision of equipment, and the frequent absence of essential drugs. Cuba has the highest doctor-to-population ratio in the world and has sent thousands of doctors to more than 40 countries around the world. According to the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>, Cuba is "known the world over for its ability to train excellent doctors and nurses who can then go out to help other countries in need". As of September 2014 there are around 50,000 Cuban-trained health care workers aiding 66 nations. Cuban physicians have played a leading role in combating the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa" title="Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa">Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa</a>.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the life expectancy in Cuba is 78.3 years (76.2 for males and 80.4 for females). This ranks Cuba 37th in the world and 3rd in the Americas, behind only Canada and Chile, and just ahead of the United States. Infant mortality in Cuba declined from 32 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1957, to 10 in 1990–95. Infant mortality in 2000–2005 was 6.1 per 1,000 live births. Its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infant_mortality_rate" title="Infant mortality rate">infant mortality rate</a> is 5.13.</p>
<p>In Cuba, there is a need to import certain <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug" title="Pharmaceutical drug">pharmaceutical drugs</a>. Therefore, the Quimefa Pharmaceutical Business Group (FARMACUBA) was developed under the Ministry of Basic Industry (MINBAS). This group also handles the exporting of pharmaceuticals, and provide technical information for the production of these drugs. Isolated from the West, Cuba developed the successful lung cancer vaccine, <a href="/wiki/CimaVax-EGF" title="CimaVax-EGF">Cimavax</a>, which now is available to US researchers for the first time, along with other novel Cuban cancer treatments. The vaccine has been available for free to the Cuban population since 2011.
