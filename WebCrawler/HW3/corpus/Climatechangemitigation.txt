<p><b>Climate change mitigation</b> consists of actions to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">climate change</a>. Climate change mitigation generally involves reductions in human (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthropogenic" title="Anthropogenic">anthropogenic</a>) emissions of <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> (GHGs). Mitigation may also be achieved by increasing the capacity of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sink" title="Carbon sink">carbon sinks</a>, e.g., through <a href="/wiki/Reforestation" title="Reforestation">reforestation</a>. Mitigation policies can substantially reduce the risks associated with human-induced global warming.</p>
<p>"Mitigation is a public good; climate change is a case of the '<a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>'". Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (See <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Cooperation" title="International Cooperation">International Cooperation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_Trading" title="Emissions Trading">Emissions Trading</a>), suggesting the need for collective action. Some adaptation actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries."</p>
<p>Examples of mitigation include <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_phase-out" title="Fossil fuel phase-out">phasing out fossil fuels</a> by switching to <a href="/wiki/Low-carbon_power" title="Low-carbon power">low-carbon energy</a> sources, such as <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear energy</a>, and expanding forests and other "sinks" to remove greater amounts of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere">carbon dioxide</a> from the atmosphere. <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">Energy efficiency</a> may also play a role, for example, through improving the <a href="/wiki/Building_insulation" title="Building insulation">insulation of buildings</a>. Another approach to climate change mitigation is <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Most countries are parties to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of GHGs at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system. Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change, but deciding which impacts are dangerous requires value judgments.</p>
<p>In 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-<a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">industrial</a> level. With the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Agreement" title="Paris Agreement">Paris Agreement</a> of 2015 this was confirmed, but was revised with a new target laying down "parties will do the best" to achieve warming below 1.5 °C. The current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °C. Other mitigation policies have been proposed, some of which are more stringent or modest than the 2 °C limit.</p>

<p>One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change" title="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avoiding_dangerous_climate_change" title="Avoiding dangerous climate change">preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system</a>. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_and_ecosystems" title="Climate change and ecosystems">ecosystems</a> can adapt naturally to climate change, <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture" title="Climate change and agriculture">food production</a> is not threatened, and <a href="/wiki/Economics_of_global_warming" title="Economics of global warming">economic development</a> can proceed in a sustainable fashion.</p>
<p>There are a number of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. These include <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (<a href="/wiki/Chemical_formula" title="Chemical formula">chemical formula</a>: CO<sub>2</sub>), <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> (<span class="chemf nowrap">CH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span>), <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> (<span class="chemf nowrap">N<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
2</span>O</span>), and a group of gases referred to as <a href="/wiki/Halocarbon" title="Halocarbon">halocarbons</a>. The emissions reductions necessary to stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of these gases varies. CO<sub>2</sub> is the most important of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases (see <a href="/wiki/Radiative_forcing" title="Radiative forcing">radiative forcing</a>).</p>
<p>There is a difference between stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>. Stabilizing emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at current levels would not lead to a stabilization in the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. In fact, stabilizing emissions at current levels would result in the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> continuing to rise over the 21st century and beyond (see the graphs opposite).</p>
<p>The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere far faster than natural processes can remove it (see <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere">carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere</a> for a more complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) into the tub faster than water escapes through the plughole (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water in the tub (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.</p>
<p>According to some studies, stabilizing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would require anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to be reduced by 80% relative to the peak emissions level. An 80% reduction in emissions would stabilize CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for around a century, but even greater reductions would be required beyond this. Other research has found that, after leaving room for emissions for food production for 9 billion people and to keep the global temperature rise below 2 °C, emissions from energy production and transport will have to peak almost immediately in the developed world and decline at ca. 10% per annum until zero emissions are reached around 2030. In developing countries energy and transport emissions would have to peak by 2025 and then decline similarly.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gases humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed. Stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation#Non-CO2_greenhouse_gases" title="Climate change mitigation">non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs</a>.</p>

<p>Projections of future greenhouse gas emissions are highly uncertain. In the absence of policies to mitigate climate change, GHG emissions could rise significantly over the 21st century.</p>
<p>Numerous assessments have considered how atmospheric GHG concentrations could be stabilized. The lower the desired stabilization level, the sooner global GHG emissions must peak and decline. GHG concentrations are unlikely to stabilize this century without major policy changes.</p>

<p>To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon <a href="/wiki/Emission_intensity" title="Emission intensity">emission intensity</a> power sources, such as conventional <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>—<a href="/wiki/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>—with <a href="/wiki/Low-carbon_power" title="Low-carbon power">low-carbon power</a> sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources. Both <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> together provide the majority of the generated <a href="/wiki/Low-carbon_power" title="Low-carbon power">low-carbon power</a> fraction of global total power consumption.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Emission_intensity" title="Emission intensity">Emission intensity</a></div>

<p>Assessments often suggest that GHG emissions can be reduced using a portfolio of low-carbon technologies. At the core of most proposals is the reduction of <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> (GHG) emissions through reducing energy waste and switching to <a href="/wiki/Low-carbon_power" title="Low-carbon power">low-carbon power</a> sources of energy. As the cost of reducing GHG emissions in the <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> sector appears to be lower than in other sectors, such as in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transportation" title="Transportation">transportation</a> sector, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy.</p>
<p>"Economic tools can be useful in designing climate change mitigation policies." "While the limitations of economics and social welfare analysis, including cost–benefit analysis, are widely documented, economics nevertheless provides useful tools for assessing the pros and cons of taking, or not taking, action on climate change mitigation, as well as of adaptation measures, in achieving competing societal goals. Understanding these pros and cons can help in making policy decisions on climate change mitigation and can influence the actions taken by countries, institutions and individuals."</p>

Many fossil fuel driven vehicles can be converted to use electricity, the U.S. has an estimated capacity of supporting 73% light duty vehicles (LDV).

<p><a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization" title="Renewable energy commercialization">Renewable energy use</a> has grown much faster than anyone anticipated.

<p>Since about 2001 the term "nuclear renaissance" has been used to refer to a possible <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> industry revival, driven by rising <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Price_of_petroleum" title="Price of petroleum">fossil fuel prices</a> and new concerns about meeting <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emission limits. However, in March 2011 the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster" title="Fukushima nuclear disaster">Fukushima nuclear disaster</a> in Japan and associated shutdowns at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2011_Japanese_nuclear_incidents" title="2011 Japanese nuclear incidents">other nuclear facilities</a> raised questions among some commentators over the future of nuclear power. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Platts" title="Platts">Platts</a> has reported that "the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world".</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Nuclear_Association" title="World Nuclear Association">World Nuclear Association</a> has reported that nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999. Several previous international studies and assessments, suggested that as part of the portfolio of other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low-carbon_energy" title="Low-carbon energy">low-carbon energy</a> technologies, nuclear power will continue to play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, nuclear power usage is estimated to have prevented the atmospheric emission of 64 giga<a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">CO2-equivalent</a> as of 2013.

While some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future GHG emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">efficiency of enrichment methods</a>. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global <a href="/wiki/Uranium_market" title="Uranium market">uranium market</a> of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter high figure being derived from a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust" by the authors of the paper, as the "ore grade" in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes.</p>

<p>Analysis in 2015 by Professor and Chair of Environmental Sustainability <a href="/wiki/Barry_Brook_(scientist)" title="Barry Brook (scientist)">Barry W. Brook</a> and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely, from the electric grid of the world, has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in France and Sweden during each nation's building programs in the 1980s, within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely, "allow[ing] the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.". In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all <a href="/wiki/World_energy_consumption" title="World energy consumption">global energy</a>, that is not solely electricity, but transportation <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Synfuels" title="Synfuels">synfuels</a> etc. could be generated within approximately 30 years, if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation's already proven decadal rates(in units of installed <a href="/wiki/Nameplate_capacity" title="Nameplate capacity">nameplate capacity</a>, <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/GW" title="GW">GW</a> per year, per unit of global <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GDP" title="GDP">GDP</a>(GW/year/$).</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a <i><a href="/wiki/100%25_renewable_energy" title="100% renewable energy">100% renewable energy</a></i> world, which would require an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude" title="Orders of magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> more costly global investment per year, an investment rate that has no historical precedent, having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost, and with far greater land area that would be required to be devoted to the wind, wave and solar projects, along with the inherent assumption that humanity will use less, and not more, energy in the future. As Brook notes the "principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives."</p>
<p>Nuclear power may be uncompetitive compared with fossil fuel energy sources in countries without a <a href="/wiki/Carbon_tax" title="Carbon tax">carbon tax</a> program, and in comparison to a fossil fuel plant of the same power output, nuclear power plants take a longer amount of time to construct.</p>
<p>Two new, first of their kind, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Pressurized_Reactor" title="European Pressurized Reactor">EPR</a> reactors under construction in Finland and France have been delayed and are running over-budget. However learning from experience, two further EPR reactors under construction in China are on, and ahead, of schedule respectively. As of 2013, according to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IAEA" title="IAEA">IAEA</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Nuclear_Society" title="European Nuclear Society">European Nuclear Society</a>, worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries. China has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction, as of 2013, with plans to build many more, while in the US the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60 years, and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration. There are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in South Korea, India, and Russia. At least 100 older and smaller reactors will "most probably be closed over the next 10–15 years". This is probable only if one does not factor in the ongoing <a href="/wiki/Light_Water_Reactor_Sustainability_Program" title="Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program">Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program</a>, created to permit the extension of the life span of the USA's 104 nuclear reactors to 60 years.

Two new "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Passive_safety" title="Passive safety">passive safety</a>" <a href="/wiki/AP1000" title="AP1000">AP1000</a> reactors are, as of 2013, being constructed at <a href="/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant" title="Vogtle Electric Generating Plant">Vogtle Electric Generating Plant</a>.</p>
<p>Public opinion about nuclear power varies widely between countries. A poll by Gallup International (2011) assessed public opinion in 47 countries. The poll was conducted following a <a href="/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" title="2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami">tsunami and earthquake</a> which caused an <a href="/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" title="Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster">accident</a> at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. 49% stated that they held favourable views about nuclear energy, while 43% held an unfavourable view. Another global survey by Ipsos (2011) assessed public opinion in 24 countries. Respondents to this survey showed a clear preference for renewable energy sources over coal and nuclear energy (refer to graph opposite). Ipsos (2012) found that solar and wind were viewed by the public as being more environmentally friendly and more viable long-term energy sources relative to nuclear power and natural gas. However, solar and wind were viewed as being less reliable relative to nuclear power and natural gas. In 2012 a poll done in the UK found that 63% of those surveyed support nuclear power, and with opposition to nuclear power at 11%. In Germany, strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-nuclear" title="Anti-nuclear">anti-nuclear</a> sentiment led to eight of the seventeen operating reactors being permanently shut down following the March 2011 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster" title="Fukushima nuclear disaster">Fukushima nuclear disaster</a>.</p>

<p>Most mitigation proposals imply—rather than directly state—an eventual reduction in global fossil fuel production. Also proposed are direct quotas on global fossil fuel production.</p>
<p>Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub> and methane—CH<sub>4</sub>) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain.</p>
<p>A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.</p>
<p>A 2011 study by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley, found that while carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al. (2013) and Alvarez et al. (2012) note that estimated that leakage from gas infrastructure is likely to be underestimated. These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a "cleaner" fuel is questionable. A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_pump">Heat pump</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Heat_pump" title="Heat pump">heat pump</a></div>

<p>A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move <a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy" title="Thermal energy">thermal energy</a> opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.</p>
<p>While <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_conditioner" title="Air conditioner">air conditioners</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freezer" title="Freezer">freezers</a> are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many <a href="/wiki/HVAC" title="HVAC">HVAC</a> (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic <a href="/wiki/Heat_pump_and_refrigeration_cycle" title="Heat pump and refrigeration cycle">refrigeration-type cycle</a> used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground. In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">more efficient</a> in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.</p>
<p>It has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by 8% annually. Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the <a href="/wiki/Primary_energy" title="Primary energy">primary energy</a> demand and 90% of CO2 emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier. Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.</p>
<p>With significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">Efficient energy use</a> and <a href="/wiki/Energy_conservation" title="Energy conservation">Energy conservation</a></div>

<p>Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, <a href="/wiki/Building_insulation" title="Building insulation">insulating a home</a> allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fluorescent_lights" title="Fluorescent lights">fluorescent lights</a> or natural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Skylight_(window)" title="Skylight (window)">skylights</a> reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulbs" title="Incandescent light bulbs">incandescent light bulbs</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lights" title="Compact fluorescent lights">Compact fluorescent lights</a> use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption" title="World energy resources and consumption">energy consumption</a>. For example, the state of <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national U.S. consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Energy_conservation" title="Energy conservation">Energy conservation</a> is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy service, for example through behavioural change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a>, improved energy efficiency in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy-efficient_buildings" title="Energy-efficient buildings">buildings</a>, industrial processes and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sustainable_transportation" title="Sustainable transportation">transportation</a> could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Demand_side_switching_sources">Demand side switching sources</span></h4>
<p>Fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed. Energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions. Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>. There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric <a href="/wiki/Heat_pump" title="Heat pump">heat pump</a> has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient <a href="/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance" title="Coefficient of performance">coefficient of performance</a> of heat pumps.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water is common.</p>
<p>The economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in <a href="/wiki/Demand_response" title="Demand response">demand response</a>. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.</p>
<p>Alternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through <a href="/wiki/Power_to_gas" title="Power to gas">power to gas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a>, or other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_neutral_fuels" title="Carbon neutral fuels">carbon neutral fuels</a>. A 2015 study by Energy+Environmental Economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas, electrification, and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in Southern California.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Demand_side_grid_management">Demand side grid management</span></h4>
<p>Expanding intermittent electrical sources such as <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>, creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental <a href="/wiki/Super_grid" title="Super grid">super grids</a> costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power,there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a <a href="/wiki/Smart_grid" title="Smart grid">smart grid</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Net_energy_metering#Time_of_use_metering" title="Net energy metering">Time of use</a> metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dynamic_demand" title="Dynamic demand">Dynamic demand</a> plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would need to have a <a href="/wiki/Smart_meter" title="Smart meter">smart meter</a> in order for the utility to calculate credits.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Demand_response" title="Demand response">Demand response</a> devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. The <a href="/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid" title="Vehicle-to-grid">vehicle-to-grid</a> suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.</p>

In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction. Food and services are more significant in poor countries, while mobility and manufactured goods are more significant in rich countries.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Avoided_desertification">Avoided desertification</span></h4>

<p>Restoring grasslands store CO<sub>2</sub> from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth. However, grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and the dying plant would stay in place. A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day a two in order to mimick natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally. Additionally, when part of leaf matter is consumed by a herding animal, a corresponding amount of root matter is sloughed off too as it would not be able to sustain the previous amount of root matter and while most of the lost root matter would rot and enter the atmosphere, part of the carbon is sequestered into the soil. It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world’s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland by 1% would offset nearly 12 years of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. <a href="/wiki/Allan_Savory" title="Allan Savory">Allan Savory</a>, as part of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holistic_management" title="Holistic management">holistic management</a>, claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification, prehistoric lands supported large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">Carbon capture and storage</a></div>
<p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says CCS could contribute between 10% and 55% of the cumulative worldwide carbon-mitigation effort over the next 90 years. The International Energy Agency says CCS is "the most important single new technology for CO<sub>2</sub> savings" in power generation and industry. Though it requires up to 40% more energy to run a CCS coal power plant than a regular coal plant, CCS could potentially capture about 90% of all the carbon emitted by the plant. Norway, which first began storing CO<sub>2</sub>, has cut its emissions by almost a million tons a year, or about 3% of the country's 1990 levels. As of late 2011, the total CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year. This is broadly equivalent to preventing the emissions from more than six million cars from entering the atmosphere each year.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">climate engineering</a></div>
<p>Geoengineering is seen by some as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by others as an entirely separate response to climate change. In a <a href="/wiki/Scientific_literature" title="Scientific literature">literature</a> assessment, Barker <i>et al.</i> (2007) described geoengineering as a type of mitigation policy. IPCC (2007) concluded that geoengineering options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, remained largely unproven. It was judged that reliable cost estimates for geoengineering had not yet been published.</p>
<p>Chapter 28 of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences" title="United States National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> report <i>Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base</i> (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry." They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question — what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.". In July 2011 a report by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Government_Accountability_Office" title="United States Government Accountability Office">United States Government Accountability Office</a> on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal" title="Carbon dioxide removal">Carbon dioxide removal</a> has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing.

<p>It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">geological storage</a> of carbon may make <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_air_capture" title="Carbon dioxide air capture">carbon dioxide air capture</a> viable commercially.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-CO2_greenhouse_gases">Non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases</span></h3>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is not the only GHG relevant to mitigation, and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other GHGs emitted by human activities (<a href="/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">anthropogenic</a> GHGs). The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs. These gases are CO<sub>2</sub>, <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> (CH<sub>4</sub>), <a href="/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O), the <a href="/wiki/Halocarbon" title="Halocarbon">hydrofluorocarbons</a> (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride" title="Sulfur hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a> (SF<sub>6</sub>).</p>
<p>Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Global_warming_potential" title="Greenhouse gas">main GHG article</a> for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount. Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N<sub>2</sub>O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N<sub>2</sub>O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">Methane</a> is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> in the amount of heat it can trap, especially in the short term. Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source. Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> released by livestock via <a href="/wiki/Flatulence" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eructation" title="Eructation">eructation</a>.</p>
<p>Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infrared_radiation" title="Infrared radiation">infrared radiation</a>). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF<sub>6</sub> is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO<sub>2</sub> on a per-kilogram basis. A measure for this physical property is the <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Global warming potential">global warming potential</a> (GWP), and is used in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>Although not designed for this purpose, the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Protocol" title="Montreal Protocol">Montreal Protocol</a> has probably benefited climate change mitigation efforts. The Montreal Protocol is an international <a href="/wiki/Treaty" title="Treaty">treaty</a> that has successfully reduced emissions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ozone-depleting_substance" title="Ozone-depleting substance">ozone-depleting substances</a> (for example, <a href="/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">CFCs</a>), which are also greenhouse gases.</p>

Increased use of <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public transport</a> can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometer. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urban_development" title="Urban development">urban development</a> in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent. Inefficient <a href="/wiki/Land_use" title="Land use">land use</a> development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.</p>
<p>At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These <a href="/wiki/Smart_growth" title="Smart growth">smart growth</a> practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space.

<p>For institutions of higher learning in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Costs">Costs</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Stern_Review" title="Stern Review">Stern Review</a> proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GDP" title="GDP">GDP</a>, (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Gross_world_product" title="Gross world product">GWP</a>), with an average estimate of approximately 1%. Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP. For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">PPP</a> was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010, thus 2% is approximately $1.5 trillion. The Review emphasises that these costs are contingent on steady reductions in the cost of low-carbon technologies. Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.</p>
<p>One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marginal_abatement_costs" title="Marginal abatement costs">marginal abatement costs</a> of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefits">Benefits</span></h3>

<p>Yohe <i>et al.</i> (2007) assessed the literature on sustainability and climate change. With high confidence, they suggested that up to the year 2050, an effort to cap greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 550 ppm would benefit developing countries significantly. This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">effects of global warming</a>. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_capacity" title="Adaptive capacity">adaptive capacity</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sharing">Sharing</span></h3>
<p>One of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies. There is no scientific consensus over how to share these costs and benefits (Toth <i>et al.</i>, 2001). In terms of the politics of mitigation, the UNFCCC's ultimate objective is to stabilize concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere at a level that would <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avoiding_dangerous_climate_change" title="Avoiding dangerous climate change">prevent "dangerous" climate change</a> (Rogner <i>et al.</i>, 2007).</p>
<p>GHG emissions are an important correlate of wealth, at least at present (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 91–92). Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heating" title="Heating">heating</a> to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like <a href="/wiki/Car" title="Car">cars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_heating" title="Central heating">central heating</a>, etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human <a href="/wiki/Welfare_economics" title="Welfare economics">welfare</a> according to wealth.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Distributing_emissions_abatement_costs">Distributing emissions abatement costs</span></h4>
<p>There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 103–105):</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">Egalitarianism</a></b>: this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.</li>
<li><b>Basic needs</b>: this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">consumption</a>. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.</li>
<li><b>Proportionality and polluter-pays principle</b>: Proportionality reflects the ancient <a href="/wiki/Aristotelianism" title="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a> principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li><i>Historical responsibilities</i>: this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg <i>et al.</i>, 1996, p. 29).</li>
<li><i>Comparable burdens and ability to pay</i>: with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNDP" title="UNDP">UNDP</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a>.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Willingness_to_pay" title="Willingness to pay">Willingness to pay</a></i>: with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.</li>

<li><b>Ad hoc</b>: Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, p. 106), for example, suggested that allocations based partly on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GNP" title="GNP">GNP</a> could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.</li>
<li><b>Equal per capita entitlements</b>: this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, pp. 106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.</li>
<li><b>Status quo</b>: with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri <i>et al.</i>, 1996, p. 107). An analogy for this approach can be made with <a href="/wiki/Fishery" title="Fishery">fisheries</a>, which is a common, limited resource.

<p>Many countries, both developing and developed, are aiming to use cleaner technologies (World Bank, 2010, p. 192). Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency. It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist. The <a href="/wiki/Commitment_to_Development_Index" title="Commitment to Development Index">Commitment to Development Index</a> is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons. Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a></div>
<p>The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>, which came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Amendment" title="wikt:Amendment">amendment</a> to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Kyoto_Protocol_signatories" title="List of Kyoto Protocol signatories">Countries that have ratified this protocol</a> have committed to reduce their emissions of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in <a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">emissions trading</a> if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Temperature_targets">Temperature targets</span></h3>

<p>Actions to mitigate climate change are sometimes based on the goal of achieving a particular temperature target. One of the targets that has been suggested is to limit the future increase in global mean temperature (global warming) to below 2 °C, relative to the pre-industrial level. The 2 °C target was adopted in 2010 by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Most countries of the world are Parties to the UNFCCC. The target had been adopted in 1996 by the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Council of the European Union">European Union Council</a>.</p>

<p>Temperatures have increased by 0.8 °C compared to the pre-industrial level, and another 0.5–0.7 °C is already <a href="/wiki/Climate_commitment" title="Climate commitment">committed</a>. The 2 °C rise is typically associated in <a href="/wiki/Climate_model" title="Climate model">climate models</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">carbon dioxide equivalent</a> concentration of 400–500 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_per_million" title="Parts per million">ppm</a> by volume; the current (January 2015) level of carbon dioxide alone is 400 ppm by volume, and rising at 1–3 ppm annually. Hence, to avoid a very likely breach of the 2 °C target, CO<sub>2</sub> levels would have to be stabilised very soon; this is generally regarded as unlikely, based on current programs in place to date. The importance of change is illustrated by the fact that world economic energy efficiency is improving at only half the rate of world <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a>.</p>

<p>There is disagreement among experts over whether or not the 2 °C target can be met. For example, according to Anderson and Bows (2011), "there is little to no chance" of meeting the target. On the other hand, according to Alcamo <i>et al.</i> (2013):</p>
<ul>
<li>Policies adopted by parties to the UNFCCC are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5 °C target. However, these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately.</li>
<li>Cost-effective 2 °C scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020, with deep cuts in emissions thereafter, leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41% compared to 1990 levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements. For example, limiting global warming to 1 °C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2 °C limit. However, a 1 °C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2 °C limit.</p>
<p>According to some analysts, the 2 °C "guardrail" is inadequate for the needed degree and timeliness of mitigation. On the other hand, some economic studies suggest more modest mitigation policies. For example, the emissions reductions proposed by Nordhaus (2010) might lead to global warming (in the year 2100) of around 3 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>In 2015, two official UNFCCC scientific expert bodies came to the conclusion that, "in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5°C". This expert position was, together with the strong diplomatic voice of the poorest countries and the island nations in the Pacific, the driving force leading to the decision of the <a href="/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference" title="2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference">Paris Conference</a> 2015, to lay down this 1.5 °C long-term target on top of the existing 2 °C goal.</p>

<p>An emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee, charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. Most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in OECD countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles, rather than on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions directly.</p>
<p>Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective. Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction. Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.</p>

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Mark_Z._Jacobson" title="Mark Z. Jacobson">Mark Z.

Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kWh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.</p>

<p>However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme" title="European Union Emission Trading Scheme">European Union Emission Trading Scheme</a> (EU ETS) is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35 billion Euros (US$43 billion) per year.

A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e).</p>
<p>Twenty three <a href="/wiki/Multinational_corporation" title="Multinational corporation">multinational corporations</a> have come together in the <a href="/wiki/G8_Climate_Change_Roundtable" title="G8 Climate Change Roundtable">G8 Climate Change Roundtable</a>, a business group formed at the January 2005 <a href="/wiki/World_Economic_Forum" title="World Economic Forum">World Economic Forum</a>.

The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Implementation">Implementation</span></h3>
<p>Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Funding">Funding</span></h4>
<p>Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions. A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation. Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues. The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which land degradation and persistent organic pollutant were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF’s implementing agencies.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Problems">Problems</span></h4>
<p>There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation. It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are, Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.</p>
<p>The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as <a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">Cap and Trade</a>, could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as apposed to one overall enforcement agency.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Occurrence">Occurrence</span></h4>
<p>Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA’s and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs. The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies. Many developed countries are implementing ‘first generation’ institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale. There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.</p>

<p>In 2007, Transportation Secretary <a href="/wiki/Mary_Peters_(politician)" title="Mary Peters (politician)">Mary Peters</a>, with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California’s first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Climate_Change_Science_Program" title="U.S. Climate Change Science Program">U.S. Climate Change Science Program</a> is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bush_administration_(2000)" title="Bush administration (2000)">Bush administration</a> pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the <a href="/wiki/Government_Accountability_Project" title="Government Accountability Project">Government Accountability Project</a>, the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by U.S. scientists pursuant to U.S. law. Some U.S. scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.</p>
<p>In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the <a href="/wiki/Regional_Greenhouse_Gas_Initiative" title="Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> in the Northeast and the <a href="/wiki/Global_Warming_Solutions_Act_of_2006" title="Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006">Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006</a> in California.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Developing_countries">Developing countries</span></h4>
<p>In order to reconcile <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a> with mitigating carbon emissions, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's <a href="/wiki/Clean_Development_Mechanism" title="Clean Development Mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism</a> (CDM). The <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>'s Prototype Carbon Fund is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_private_partnership" title="Public private partnership">public private partnership</a> that operates within the CDM.</p>
<p>An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation. One of the outcomes of the UNFCC <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Climate_Conference" title="Copenhagen Climate Conference">Copenhagen Climate Conference</a> was the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord" title="Copenhagen Accord">Copenhagen Accord</a>, in which developed countries promised to provide US $30 million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources. Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> have found four main understandings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals#Controversy_over_funding_of_0.7.25_of_GNI" title="Millennium Development Goals">‘0.7%’ ODA target</a>;</li>
<li>Increase on previous year's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Official_Development_Assistance" title="Official Development Assistance">Official Development Assistance</a> (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;</li>
<li>Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and</li>
<li>Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main point being that there is a conflict between the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a>.</p>
<p>However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.</p>
<p>In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNEP" title="UNEP">UNEP</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WTO" title="WTO">WTO</a> urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Doha_round" title="Doha round">Doha trade round</a> "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-governmental_approaches">Non-governmental approaches</span></h2>
<p>While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and <a href="/wiki/Business_action_on_climate_change" title="Business action on climate change">businesses</a> can also play a part in the mitigation effort.</p>

Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)" title="Clean Air Act (United States)">Clean Air Act</a>, and against the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Export-Import_Bank_of_the_United_States" title="Export-Import Bank of the United States">Export-Import Bank</a> and <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Private_Investment_Corporation" title="Overseas Private Investment Corporation">OPIC</a> for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NEPA" title="NEPA">NEPA</a>.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations as <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Urgenda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Urgenda (page does not exist)">Urgenda</a> and the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Vzw_Klimaatzaak&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Vzw Klimaatzaak (page does not exist)">vzw Klimaatzaak</a> in Belgium have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda has all ready won their case against the Dutch government.</p>
<p>According to a 2004 study commissioned by <a href="/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth" title="Friends of the Earth">Friends of the Earth</a>, <a href="/wiki/ExxonMobil" title="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.</p>
<p>In 2015, <a href="/wiki/Exxon" title="Exxon">Exxon</a>, received a subpoena. According to the Washington Post and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, <a href="/wiki/Eric_Schneiderman" title="Eric Schneiderman">Eric Schneiderman</a>, opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had mislead the public and investors about the risks of climate change.</p>
