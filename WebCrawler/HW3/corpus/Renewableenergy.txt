<p><b>Renewable energy</b> is generally defined as energy that is collected from <a href="/wiki/Renewable_resource" title="Renewable resource">resources</a> which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wind" title="Wind">wind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rain" title="Rain">rain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tidal_power" title="Tidal power">tides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wave_power" title="Wave power">waves</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_energy" title="Geothermal energy">geothermal heat</a>. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>, air and water heating/cooling, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transportation" title="Transportation">transportation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stand-alone_power_system" title="Stand-alone power system">rural (off-grid)</a> energy services.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="/wiki/REN21" title="REN21">REN21</a>'s 2016 report, renewables contributed 19.2% to humans' <a href="/wiki/World_energy_consumption" title="World energy consumption">global energy consumption</a> and 23.7% to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from <a href="/wiki/Biofuel#traditional" title="Biofuel">traditional biomass</a>, 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% hydro electricity and 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biomass</a>. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in 2015, with countries like <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China" title="Renewable energy in China">China</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States" title="Renewable energy in the United States">United States</a> heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels. Globally, there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_photovoltaics" title="Solar photovoltaics">solar photovoltaics</a> being the largest renewable employer.</p>
<p>Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-renewable_energy" title="Non-renewable energy">other energy sources</a>, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> is resulting in significant <a href="/wiki/Energy_security_and_renewable_technology" title="Energy security and renewable technology">energy security</a>, <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">climate change mitigation</a>, and economic benefits. The results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> (GHG) emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change, a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies. In international <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_opinion_surveys" title="Public opinion surveys">public opinion surveys</a> there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond. Some places and at least two countries, Iceland and Norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already, and many other countries have the set a goal to reach <a href="/wiki/100%25_renewable_energy" title="100% renewable energy">100% renewable energy</a> in the future. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> the government decided to <a href="/wiki/Energy_transition" title="Energy transition">switch the total energy supply</a> (electricity, mobility and heating/cooling) to 100% renewable energy by 2050.</p>
<p>While many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rural" title="Rural">rural</a> and remote areas and <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_developing_countries" title="Renewable energy in developing countries">developing countries</a>, where energy is often crucial in <a href="/wiki/Human_development_(humanity)" title="Human development (humanity)">human development</a>. <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>' Secretary-General <a href="/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. As most of renewables provide electricity, renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further <a href="/wiki/Electrification" title="Electrification">electrification</a>, which has several benefits: For example, electricity can be converted to heat without losses and even reach higher temperatures than fossil fuels, can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the point of consumpion. In addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements, because most renewables don't have a steam cycle with high losses (fossil power plants usually have losses of 40 to 65%).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires, dates from 790,000 years ago. Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later, sometime between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago. Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships on the Nile. Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human <a href="/wiki/Manual_labour" title="Manual labour">labor</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animal_power" title="Animal power">animal power</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_power" title="Water power">water power</a>, wind, in grain crushing <a href="/wiki/Windmill" title="Windmill">windmills</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Firewood" title="Firewood">firewood</a>, a traditional biomass. A graph of energy use in the United States up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010.</p>
<p>In the 1860s and '70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Augustine_Mouchot&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Augustine Mouchot (page does not exist)">Augustine Mouchot</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources, so necessary for it. Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places. Will man, then, return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all? History will show what will come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1885, <a href="/wiki/Werner_von_Siemens" title="Werner von Siemens">Werner von Siemens</a>, commenting on the discovery of the <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_effect" title="Photovoltaic effect">photovoltaic effect</a> in the solid state, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Die_protestantische_Ethik_und_der_Geist_des_Kapitalismus" title="Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus">Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus</a>, published in 1905.</p>
<p>Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 <i><a href="/wiki/Scientific_American" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i> article: "in the far distant future, <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">natural fuels</a> having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race".</p>
<p>The theory of <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a> was published in 1956. In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Depletion_of_oil" title="Depletion of oil">depletion of oil</a>, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil, and the first electricity generating <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a> appeared. Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.</p>
<p>The IEA 2014 World Energy Outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1,700 gigawatts in 2014 to 4,550 gigawatts in 2040. Fossil fuels received about $550 billion in subsidies in 2013, compared to $120 billion for all renewable energies.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">Wind power</a></div>

<p>Airflows can be used to run <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a>. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600Â kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5â€“3 MW have become the most common for commercial use; the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high <a href="/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a> sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically <a href="/wiki/Capacity_factor" title="Capacity factor">full load hours</a> of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.</p>
<p>Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines. In 2014 global wind generation was 706 terawatt-hours or 3% of the worlds total electricity.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">Hydroelectricity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">Hydropower</a></div>

<p>In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity. Since water is about 800 times <a href="/wiki/Density_of_air" title="Density of air">denser than air</a>, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea <a href="/wiki/Swell_(ocean)" title="Swell (ocean)">swell</a>, can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in third world countries. The largest of which is the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a>(2003) in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Itaipu_Dam" title="Itaipu Dam">Itaipu Dam</a>(1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Small_hydro" title="Small hydro">Small hydro</a> systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to <span class="nowrap">50 MW</span> of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity" title="Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity">Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity</a> plants derive <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> from rivers without the creation of a large <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoir</a>. This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Joseph_Dam" title="Chief Joseph Dam">Chief Joseph Dam</a> on the Columbia river in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. For counties having the <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources" title="List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources">largest percentage</a> of electricity from renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW: the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> in China, <a href="/wiki/Itaipu_Dam" title="Itaipu Dam">Itaipu Dam</a> across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and <a href="/wiki/Guri_Dam" title="Guri Dam">Guri Dam</a> in Venezuela.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wave_power" title="Wave power">Wave power</a>, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and <a href="/wiki/Tidal_power" title="Tidal power">tidal power</a>, converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially.

Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy#Dish_designs" title="Solar thermal energy">CSP-Stirling</a> has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.</p>
<p>In 2011, the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits.

<p>High Temperature Geothermal energy is from <a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy" title="Thermal energy">thermal energy</a> generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> of minerals (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_gradient" title="Geothermal gradient">geothermal gradient</a>, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of <a href="/wiki/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a> from the core to the surface. The adjective <i>geothermal</i> originates from the Greek roots <i>geo</i>, meaning earth, and <i>thermos</i>, meaning heat.</p>
<p>The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's coreÂ â€“ 4,000 miles (6,400Â km) down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000Â Â°F (5,000Â Â°C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to 700Â Â°F (371Â Â°C).</p>
<p>From <a href="/wiki/Hot_spring" title="Hot spring">hot springs</a>, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>.</p>
<p>Low Temperature Geothermal refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a <a href="/wiki/Thermal_Battery" title="Thermal Battery">Thermal Battery</a> to facilitate <a href="/wiki/Renewable_thermal_energy" title="Renewable thermal energy">Renewable thermal energy</a> for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. In this form of Geothermal, a <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pump" title="Geothermal heat pump">Geothermal Heat Pump</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ground-coupled_heat_exchanger" title="Ground-coupled heat exchanger">Ground-coupled heat exchanger</a> are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy. New York City has even just passed a law to require GHP anytime is shown to be economical with 20 year financing including the Socialized Cost of Carbon.</p>

<p>Biomass is <a href="/wiki/Biomaterial" title="Biomaterial">biological material</a> derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called <a href="/wiki/Lignocellulosic_biomass" title="Lignocellulosic biomass">lignocellulosic biomass</a>. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: <i>thermal</i>, <i>chemical</i>, and <i>biochemical</i> methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues â€“ such as dead trees, branches and <a href="/wiki/Tree_stump" title="Tree stump">tree stumps</a> â€“, yard clippings, wood chips and even <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a>. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial <a href="/wiki/Chemical_industry" title="Chemical industry">chemicals</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a>. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including <a href="/wiki/Miscanthus" title="Miscanthus">miscanthus</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Switchgrass" title="Switchgrass">switchgrass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Populus" title="Populus">poplar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bamboo" title="Bamboo">bamboo</a>, and a variety of tree species, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Eucalyptus" title="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_palm" title="Oil palm">oil palm</a> (<a href="/wiki/Palm_oil" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>).</p>
<p>Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy. Some examples of these plants are wheat, which typically yield 7.5â€“8 tonnes of grain per hectare, and straw, which typically yield 3.5â€“5 tonnes per hectare in the UK. The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a> to <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel.</p>
<p>Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> gas or transportation fuels like <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gasÂ â€“ also called <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a> or <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a>. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Also, biomass to liquids (BTLs) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research. There is a great deal of research involving <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Algal_fuel" title="Algal fuel">algal fuel</a> or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it's a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, <a href="/wiki/Butanol" title="Butanol">butanol</a>, and methane, as well as biodiesel and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> (sugar cane residue) and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">Biofuels</a> include a wide range of fuels which are derived from <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>. The term covers <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels#Solid_biofuels" title="Biofuels">solid</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels#Ethanol" title="Biofuels">liquid</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels#Biogas" title="Biofuels">gaseous</a> fuels. Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as biodiesel. Gaseous biofuels include <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Synthetic_gas" title="Synthetic gas">synthetic gas</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioethanol" title="Bioethanol">Bioethanol</a> is an alcohol made by <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation" title="Ethanol fermentation">fermenting</a> the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops. These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, <a href="/wiki/Sweet_sorghum" title="Sweet sorghum">sweet sorghum</a>. The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by <a href="/wiki/International_Crops_Research_Institute_for_the_Semi-Arid_Tropics" title="International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</a> for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_the_United_States" title="Ethanol fuel in the United States">United States</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_Brazil" title="Ethanol fuel in Brazil">Brazil</a>. The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the <a href="/wiki/European_Environment_Agency" title="European Environment Agency">European Environment Agency</a>, biofuels do not address global warming concerns. Biodiesel is made from <a href="/wiki/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oils</a>, <a href="/wiki/Animal_fat" title="Animal fat">animal fats</a> or recycled greases. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using <a href="/wiki/Transesterification" title="Transesterification">transesterification</a> and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010.</p>
<p>Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO<sub>x</sub>), nitrous oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution. Biomass combustion is a major contributor. The life cycle of the plants is sustainable, the lives of people less so.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Growth_of_renewables">Growth of renewables</span></h3>

<p>From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10â€“60% annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years. More wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected PV increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60% annual average growth rate. In 2010, renewable power constituted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities.</p>
<p>Projections vary, but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100% of the world's energy with <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a> by the year 2030.</p>
<p>According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. Cedric Philibert, senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the IEA said: "Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060Â â€“ and half of all energy needsÂ â€“ with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation". "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity", Philibert said.</p>
<p>In 2014 global <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> capacity expanded 16% to 369,553 MW. Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage, 11.4% in the EU, and it is widely used in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_China" title="Wind power in China">Asia</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_States" title="Wind power in the United States">United States</a>. In 2015, worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 227 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatts" title="Gigawatts">gigawatts</a> (GW), sufficient to supply 1 percent of global <a href="/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption" title="Electric energy consumption">electricity demands</a>. <a href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy" title="Solar thermal energy">Solar thermal energy</a> stations operate in the USA and Spain, and as of 2016, the largest of these is the 392 MW <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Electric_Generating_System" title="Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System">Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System</a> in California. The world's largest <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">geothermal power</a> installation is <a href="/wiki/The_Geysers" title="The Geysers">The Geysers</a> in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW. <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Brazil" title="Renewable energy in Brazil">Brazil</a> has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">ethanol fuel</a> from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the USA.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_trends">Economic trends</span></h3>

<p>Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."</p>
<p>Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LCOE" title="LCOE">LCOE</a>) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (<a href="/wiki/Photovoltaics" title="Photovoltaics">PV</a>), concentrated solar power (<a href="/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power" title="Concentrated solar power">CSP</a>) and some biomass technologies. Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today". A series of studies by the US <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> modeled the "grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power." In the models, inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of "between $0.47 and $1.28 to each MegaWatt hour generated"; however, the savings in the cost of the fuels saved "adds up to $7 billion, meaning the added costs are, at most, two percent of the savings."</p>

<p>In 2010, the United States led the world in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geothermal_electricity" title="Geothermal electricity">geothermal electricity</a> production with 3,086 MW of installed capacity from 77 power plants; the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at <a href="/wiki/The_Geysers" title="The Geysers">The Geysers</a>, a geothermal field in California. The Philippines follows the US as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world, with 1,904 MW of capacity online; geothermal power makes up approximately 18% of the country's electricity generation.</p>

<p>Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.</p>
<p>Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.</p>
<p>Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. As of 2010, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Some <a href="/wiki/Small_Island_Developing_States" title="Small Island Developing States">Small Island Developing States</a> (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability.</p>
<p>Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a> made in household-scale digesters for <a href="/wiki/Lighting" title="Lighting">lighting</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a>, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves. Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to <a href="/wiki/Poverty_reduction" title="Poverty reduction">poverty reduction</a> by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.</p>

As of March 2010, IRENA has 143Â member states who all are considered as founding members, of which 14 have also ratified the statute.</p>
<p>As of 2011, 119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy. National targets now exist in at least 98 countries. There is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels.</p>
<p>United Nations' Secretary-General <a href="/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. In October 2011, he "announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access, energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy. The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="100.25_renewable_energy">100% renewable energy</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/100%25_renewable_energy" title="100% renewable energy">100% renewable energy</a></div>
<p>The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization" title="Renewable energy commercialization">Renewable energy use</a> has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and <a href="/wiki/Robert_H._Socolow" title="Robert H. Socolow">Robert H. Socolow</a> have developed a series of "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stabilization_wedges" title="Stabilization wedges">stabilization wedges</a>" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges".</p>
<p>Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a <a href="/wiki/Science_(journal)" title="Science (journal)">Science</a> paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist <a href="/wiki/Bent_S%C3%B8rensen_(physicist)" title="Bent SÃ¸rensen (physicist)">Bent SÃ¸rensen</a>. It was followed by several other proposals, until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europa and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor <a href="/wiki/Henrik_Lund_(academic)" title="Henrik Lund (academic)">Henrik Lund</a> published a first paper in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the <a href="/wiki/Energy_transition" title="Energy transition">transition</a> to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europa, America, Australia and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>In 2011 <a href="/wiki/Mark_Z._Jacobson" title="Mark Z. Jacobson">Mark Z. Jacobson</a>, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal <a href="/wiki/Energy_Policy_(journal)" title="Energy Policy (journal)">Energy Policy</a>. They found producing all new energy with <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a> by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". They also found that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs â€¦ Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand." .</p>
<p>The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 <i>Post Carbon Pathways</i> report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_denial" title="Climate change denial">climate change denial</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby" title="Fossil fuels lobby">fossil fuels lobby</a>, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Emerging_technologies">Emerging technologies</span></h2>
<p>Other renewable energy technologies are still under development, and include <a href="/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic ethanol</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hot-dry-rock" title="Hot-dry-rock">hot-dry-rock</a> geothermal power, and <a href="/wiki/Marine_energy" title="Marine energy">marine energy</a>. These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields. Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL), both of which are funded by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> and supported by various corporate partners.

<p>Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intermittent_power_source" title="Intermittent power source">intermittent</a>, but is not true for concentrated solar, geothermal and biofuels, that have continuity. In any case, the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks.</p>
<p>There have been "not in my back yard" (<a href="/wiki/NIMBY" title="NIMBY">NIMBY</a>) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some <a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">wind farms</a>, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction. In the USA, the Massachusetts <a href="/wiki/Cape_Wind" title="Cape Wind">Cape Wind</a> project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive. According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the <a href="/wiki/Ardrossan_Wind_Farm" title="Ardrossan Wind Farm">Ardrossan Wind Farm</a> in Scotland has enhanced the area.</p>
<p>A recent UK Government document states that "projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake". In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities, particularly through <a href="/wiki/Cooperative" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a> structures, and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment.</p>
