However, it requires a multi-faceted definition because it can manifest itself through various different ways. For example, some projects may show more discernable signs of green development than others, (solar panels are more visibly "green" than the use of local materials). Nevertheless, green development is based on solution multipliers: features of a project that provide additional benefits, which ultimately reduce the projects’ environmental impacts. More specifically, green development can be defined by three sub-categories: environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and community and cultural sensitivity. Environmental responsiveness respects the intrinsic value of nature, and minimizes damage to an ecosystem. Environmental efficiency refers to the use of fewer resources to conserve energy and the environment. Community and cultural sensitivity considers how the cultural values of a community relate to real estate development.</p>
<p>The above green development concepts have been derived from the all-inclusive tome released by The Rocky Mountain Institute, entitled Green Development: Integrating Ecology and Real Estate.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Green development emerged as a result of the environmental movement in the 1970s. Green development in real estate however, had its infancy in 1897 with a report from the World Commission on Environment and Development, entitled Our Common Future. The report includes 16 principles of environmental management, designed to foster green development. It also discusses the traditional model of macroeconomic growth, and its disregard for environmental consequences. From this initial movement, the future experienced a back-and-forth relationship with green methodologies; environmental issues often came second behind purely economic factors. Incessant environmental concern and legislation, including in real estate development began to emerge, i.e. Green development. However, a common concern of green real estate development is that it may increase costs and time, hence the ongoing argument of whether sustainability can also be economically feasible. National environmental attention has since, worked its way down to real estate developers, and become quite a hot topic.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legislation_Contributing_to_Green_Development">Legislation Contributing to Green Development</span></h2>
<p>In response to increasing public concern regarding environmental issues, the government adopted a series of environmental controls in the real estate market. For example, in California, such legislation included the National Environmental Policy Act, the NEPA process, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The National Environmental Policy Act, signed in 1970, changed how federal agencies made decisions because it required them to propose environmental analysis before starting a project. The Clean Air Act (1970) requires the EPA to set national models for clean air. The Clean Water Act (1972) was designed to minimize pollution in natural bodies of water, and also to create bodies of water that are clean enough for recreational activities such as fishing or swimming. The Coastal Zone Management Act (1972) manages the nations coastal resources such as Great Lakes and estuaries. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), is also known as "Superfund." It is commonly referred to as "Superfund" because it comprises two trust funds that provide help to improve areas that have been polluted by hazardous waste. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 allows the government to lien a property that is being cleaned up. Additionally, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is California's most comprehensive piece of legislation regarding the environment. This act applies to all decisions made by cities and counties in California, and includes the mandate of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), to both public and private projects. Subsequently, any new real estate development is subject to a detailed environmental analysis before starting a project.</p>
<p>Another piece of legislation promoting a more sustainable approach to development is California's Senate Bill (SB) 375 (2008). It aims to achieve California's climate goals via more efficient land use and development patterns. More specifically, SB 375 seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through close coordination between land-use and transportation. One way this is achieved is through demand-side measures. This strategy would decrease driving demand, and therefore reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and ultimately reduce GHG emissions. For example, a demand-side policy component may include placing public transit stops near development, in order to maximize walkability.</p>
<p>Additionally, California state law requires minimum energy conservation levels for all new and/or existing development projects. The seller of a home is required to include information regarding energy conservation retrofitting and thermal insulation in the sales the contract.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Broad_Development_Patterns">Broad Development Patterns</span></h3>
<p>One manifestation of the Senate Bill 375 is Growth Management, which is an urban panning strategy, defined by a close coordination between land-use controls and capital investment and heavily motivated by environmental issues. It is defined by "the regulation of the amount, timing, location, and character of development."  As the name may suggest, growth management may not imply limiting any growth. "Growth control" carries the connotation of managing or limiting growth, and "no growth" would indicate stopping growth all together. Moreover, Growth Management requires the cooperation of all three of these connotations.</p>
<p>Urban Growth Boundaries (UBG's), are popular growth management strategies. They are designed to encourage growth within a given boundary and discourage it outside the boundary. The goal of the UGB is to promote dense development, in order to decrease urban sprawl. This growth management technique ultimately seeks to revitalize central cities, and create vibrant, walk-able spaces for community development.</p>
<p>These clustered development patterns are solution multipliers. Reducing demand for infrastructure can save money and resources. These multipliers can increase walkability, which fosters social interaction and community togetherness.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intelligent_Building">Intelligent Building</span></h3>
<p>In the US, commercial and residential buildings are the highest consumers of electricity and HVAC systems comprise a large portion of this usage. In fact, the US Department of Energy projects that 70% of the electricity used in the US is from buildings. Intelligent Building methods such as Occupancy Detection Systems, Wireless Sensor Networks, and HVAC Control Systems aim to more efficient energy usage. A team of researchers at the University of San Diego, project that their smart building automation systems will save 10%-15% in building energy.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Holly_Street_Village_Apartments">The Holly Street Village Apartments</span></h3>
<p>The city of Pasadena has recently adopted a general plan based on seven guiding principles: community needs and quality of life, preservation of Pasadena's historic character, economic vitality, a healthy family community, lack of need for automobiles, promoted as a cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment and educational center for the region, and community participation.</p>
<p>This project included environmental concern and social considerations in the process of construction. The Holly Street Village Apartments in Pasadena address several of the principles outlined in Pasadena's general plan. It incorporates mixed-use development with ground-floor retail center including a deli, a convenience store and an art gallery. Also, the Holly Street Village Apartments is located near a light rail station. The goal of these strategies is to reduce the demand for automobiles, and making it easier for people to use public transportation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Inn_of_the_Anazasi">Inn of the Anazasi</span></h3>
<p>Zimmer Associates International, a real estate development firm, completed the Inn of the Anasazi in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1991. Robert Zimmer (co-founder) and his partners, Steve Conger and Michael Fuller, set a goal to construct a building that would, "showcase energy- and resource-saving technologies, strengthen local community, offer first class elegance, and financially reward its participants.”  The interior design of the hotel pays respect to the ancient Anasazi Indians, including locally crafted furniture, hand-made rugs, and Native American, Hispanic and cowboy wall art. The use of adobe on the exterior of the hotel includes the historic pueblo style. Also, Zimmer and his partners repurposed a steel-framed building that had previously been used in the 1960s as a juvenile detention center, instead of starting the project from the beginning. Other "green" characteristics of this Santa Fe hotel are skylights, energy-efficient lighting, and water-saving fixtures. Also, the Inn of the Anasazi stimulates the regional economy by purchasing locally grown organic food from Hispanic farmers. Lastly the Inn encourage that the staff participate in local nonprofit organizations and events that sponsor diverse local cultures. The Inn of the Anasazi integrates "social and environmental goals with financial considerations…” </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taipei_101">Taipei 101</span></h3>
<p>Taipei 101 is a 1,667-foot tall skyscraper located in Taiwan, and has received LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the US Green Building Council as the highest score in history. Taipei is an acronym for “technology,” “art,” “innovation,” “people,” “environment,” and “identity. Dr. Hubert Keiber, CEO of Siemens Building Automation in Taipei, stresses energy efficiency on the grounds that energy is the single largest expense for commercial buildings. Since 2011, the Taipei 101 has become the world’s most environmentally responsible skyscraper, reducing water use, energy use, and carbon emissions all by 10%. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Boulder.2C_Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</span></h3>
<p>Growth management/limitation (discussed previously) manifests itself in Boulder, Colorado. The city of Boulder very tightly restricts housing development by limiting housing permits to 400 per year, which is 1 percent of the city's total housing stock. Additionally, the city has purchased land outside of the city limits, designated for permanent, green open space. This 400-unit cap seriously hinders population growth in the city. This shortage of housing has several repercussions. First of all, it increases housing prices. Also, because Boulder restricts housing development more than it does commercial development, the number of available workers in Boulder grows faster than the housing stock. This results in many workers who commute from beyond the city limits.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critiques_of_Green_Development">Critiques of Green Development</span></h2>
<p>A common critique of green development is that it negatively affects the way real estate developers do business, as it can increase cost and create delay. For example, becoming LEED certified (Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design), can contribute to additional costs. This includes additional building design and construction fees, interior design and construction fees, building operations and maintenance fees, neighborhood development fees, home and campus fees, and volume program fees. Additionally, green development has been critiqued on a residential level. High-performance homes have proven to save energy in the long run, but they rapidly increase up-front capital costs, via tankless water heaters, radiant barriers and reflective insulation systems, and high efficiency air conditioning systems. Also, developers are often unable to develop on certain portions of land due to conservation easements. These easements are purchased by governments or non-governmental organizations, in order to “preserve land in its natural, scenic, agricultural, historical, forested, or open-space condition.”  However, some developers argue that conservation easements leave landowners with limited uses. </p>
