<p>The <a href="/wiki/History_of_Denmark" title="History of Denmark">unified kingdom of Denmark</a> emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for <a href="/wiki/Dominium_maris_baltici" title="Dominium maris baltici">control of the Baltic Sea</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Etymology_of_Denmark" title="Etymology of Denmark">Etymology of Denmark</a></div>
<p>The etymology of the word Denmark, and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom, is a subject which attracts debate. This is centred primarily on the prefix <i>"Dan"</i> and whether it refers to the <a href="/wiki/Danes_(Germanic_tribe)" title="Danes (Germanic tribe)">Dani</a> or a historical person <a href="/wiki/Dan_(king)" title="Dan (king)">Dan</a> and the exact meaning of the -<i>"mark"</i> ending.</p>
<p>Most handbooks derive the first part of the word, and the name of the people, from a word meaning "flat land", related to German <i>Tenne</i> "threshing floor", English <i>den</i> "cave". The <i>-mark</i> is believed to mean <a href="/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a> or <a href="/wiki/Border" title="Border">borderland</a> (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/March_(territory)" title="March (territory)">marches</a>), with probable references to the border forests in south <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Schleswig" title="Duchy of Schleswig">Schleswig</a>.</p>
<p>The first recorded use of the word <i>Danmark</i> within Denmark itself is found on the two <a href="/wiki/Jelling_stones" title="Jelling stones">Jelling stones</a>, which are <a href="/wiki/Runestone" title="Runestone">runestones</a> believed to have been erected by <a href="/wiki/Gorm_the_Old" title="Gorm the Old">Gorm the Old</a> (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 955</span>) and <a href="/wiki/Harald_Bluetooth" title="Harald Bluetooth">Harald Bluetooth</a> (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 965</span>). The larger stone of the two is popularly cited as Denmark's baptismal certificate (<i>dåbsattest</i>), though both use the word "Denmark", in the form of <a href="/wiki/Accusative_case" title="Accusative case">accusative</a> <span class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr" style="font-family: 'BabelStone Runic Beagnoth', 'BabelStone Runic Beorhtnoth', 'BabelStone Runic Beorhtric', 'BabelStone Runic Beowulf', 'BabelStone Runic Berhtwald', 'BabelStone Runic Byrhtferth', Junicode, Kevinch, 'Free Monospaced', Code2000, Hnias, 'Noto Sans Runic', 'Segoe UI Historic', 'Segoe UI Symbol';" title="runes">ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ</span> "tanmaurk" (<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[danmɒrk]</span>) on the large stone, and <a href="/wiki/Genitive_case" title="Genitive case">genitive</a> <span class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr" style="font-family: 'BabelStone Runic Beagnoth', 'BabelStone Runic Beorhtnoth', 'BabelStone Runic Beorhtric', 'BabelStone Runic Beowulf', 'BabelStone Runic Berhtwald', 'BabelStone Runic Byrhtferth', Junicode, Kevinch, 'Free Monospaced', Code2000, Hnias, 'Noto Sans Runic', 'Segoe UI Historic', 'Segoe UI Symbol';" title="runes">ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ</span> "tanmarkar" (pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[danmarkaɽ]</span>) on the small stone.

<p>The earliest <a href="/wiki/Archaeology_of_Denmark" title="Archaeology of Denmark">archaeological findings in Denmark</a> date back to the <a href="/wiki/Eemian" title="Eemian">Eem interglacial period</a> from 130,000–110,000 <a href="/wiki/B.C._(comic_strip)" title="B.C. (comic strip)">BC</a>. Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC. The <a href="/wiki/Nordic_Bronze_Age" title="Nordic Bronze Age">Nordic Bronze Age</a> (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by <a href="/wiki/Tumulus" title="Tumulus">burial mounds</a>, which left an abundance of findings including <a href="/wiki/Lur" title="Lur">lurs</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Trundholm_sun_chariot" title="Trundholm sun chariot">Sun Chariot</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pre-Roman_Iron_Age" title="Pre-Roman Iron Age">Pre-Roman Iron Age</a> (500 BC – AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal <a href="/wiki/Danes_(Germanic_tribe)" title="Danes (Germanic tribe)">Danes</a> came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Germanic_Iron_Age" title="Germanic Iron Age">Germanic Iron Age</a>, in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Iron_Age" title="Roman Iron Age">Roman Iron Age</a> (AD 1–400). The <a href="/wiki/Roman_province" title="Roman province">Roman provinces</a> maintained <a href="/wiki/Trade_route" title="Trade route">trade routes</a> and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and <a href="/wiki/Roman_currency" title="Roman currency">Roman coins</a> have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong <a href="/wiki/Celtic_nations" title="Celtic nations">Celtic</a> cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the <a href="/wiki/Gundestrup_cauldron" title="Gundestrup cauldron">Gundestrup cauldron</a>.</p>
<p>The tribal Danes came from the east <a href="/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Denmark" title="List of islands of Denmark">Danish islands</a> (<a href="/wiki/Zealand" title="Zealand">Zealand</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Scania" title="Scania">Scania</a> and spoke an early form of <a href="/wiki/North_Germanic_languages" title="North Germanic languages">North Germanic</a>. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of <a href="/wiki/Jutland" title="Jutland">Jutland</a> and the nearest islands were settled by tribal <a href="/wiki/Jutes" title="Jutes">Jutes</a>. The Jutes migrated to <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> eventually, some as mercenaries by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brythonic_languages" title="Brythonic languages">Brythonic</a> King <a href="/wiki/Vortigern" title="Vortigern">Vortigern</a>, and were granted the south-eastern territories of <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Wight" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a> and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnically cleansed</a> by the invading <a href="/wiki/Angles" title="Angles">Angles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>, who formed the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>.

<p>A short note about the <i>Dani</i> in "<a href="/wiki/Getica" title="Getica">Getica</a>" by the historian <a href="/wiki/Jordanes" title="Jordanes">Jordanes</a> is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_group" title="Ethnic group">ethnic groups</a> from whom modern <a href="/wiki/Danes" title="Danes">Danes</a> are descended. The <a href="/wiki/Danevirke" title="Danevirke">Danevirke</a> defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king. A <a href="/wiki/Younger_Futhark" title="Younger Futhark">new runic alphabet</a> was first used around the same time and <a href="/wiki/Ribe" title="Ribe">Ribe</a>, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.</p>

<p>From the 8th to the 10th century the wider <a href="/wiki/History_of_Scandinavia" title="History of Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> region was the source of <a href="/wiki/Vikings" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern <a href="/wiki/British_Isles" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>. They conquered and settled parts of <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> (known as the <a href="/wiki/Danelaw" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>) under King <a href="/wiki/Sweyn_Forkbeard" title="Sweyn Forkbeard">Sweyn Forkbeard</a> in 1013, and <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> where Danes and Norwegians founded <a href="/wiki/Normandy" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> with <a href="/wiki/Rollo" title="Rollo">Rollo</a> as head of state. More <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pence" title="Pence">pence</a> of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.</p>

<p>Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in <a href="/wiki/Frankish_language" title="Frankish language">Frankish</a> sources as kings (<i>reges</i>). Under the reign of <a href="/wiki/Gudfred" title="Gudfred">Gudfred</a> in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the <a href="/wiki/Lands_of_Denmark" title="Lands of Denmark">lands</a> of Jutland, <a href="/wiki/Scania" title="Scania">Scania</a> and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm. The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to <a href="/wiki/Gorm_the_Old" title="Gorm the Old">Gorm the Old</a>, who established his reign in the early 10th century. As attested by the <a href="/wiki/Jelling_stones" title="Jelling stones">Jelling stones</a>, the Danes were <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christianised" title="Christianised">Christianised</a> around 965 by <a href="/wiki/Harald_Bluetooth" title="Harald Bluetooth">Harald Bluetooth</a>, the son of <a href="/wiki/Gorm_the_Old" title="Gorm the Old">Gorm</a>. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Christian power</a> in Europe, the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fortresses" title="Fortresses">fortresses</a> around Denmark called <a href="/wiki/Viking_ring_fortress" title="Viking ring fortress">Trelleborg</a> and built a further <a href="/wiki/Danevirke" title="Danevirke">Danevirke</a>. In the early 11th century, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Canute_the_Great" title="Canute the Great">Canute the Great</a> won and united Denmark, England, and <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High</a> and <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, Denmark also included <a href="/wiki/Sk%C3%A5neland" title="Skåneland">Skåneland</a> (the areas of Scania, <a href="/wiki/Halland" title="Halland">Halland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Blekinge" title="Blekinge">Blekinge</a> in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled <a href="/wiki/Danish_Estonia" title="Danish Estonia">Danish Estonia</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Duchy" title="Duchy">duchies</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Schleswig" title="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> and <a href="/wiki/Holstein" title="Holstein">Holstein</a>. Most of the latter two now form the state of <a href="/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein" title="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a> in northern Germany.</p>
<p>In 1397, Denmark entered into a <a href="/wiki/Personal_union" title="Personal union">personal union</a> with <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sweden%E2%80%93Finland" title="Sweden–Finland">Sweden</a>, united under Queen <a href="/wiki/Margaret_I_of_Denmark" title="Margaret I of Denmark">Margaret I</a>. The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear "senior" partner of the union. Thus, much of the next 125 years of <a href="/wiki/History_of_Scandinavia" title="History of Scandinavia">Scandinavian history</a> revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as <a href="/wiki/List_of_Swedish_monarchs" title="List of Swedish monarchs">Swedish King</a> <a href="/wiki/Gustav_I_of_Sweden" title="Gustav I of Sweden">Gustav Vasa</a> conquered the city of <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the <a href="/wiki/Count%27s_Feud" title="Count's Feud">Count's Feud</a> civil war, <a href="/wiki/Reformation_in_Denmark%E2%80%93Norway_and_Holstein" title="Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein">Denmark converted</a> to <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.</p>

<p>After Sweden permanently <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foundation_of_modern_Sweden" title="Foundation of modern Sweden">broke away</a> from the personal union, Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King <a href="/wiki/Christian_IV_of_Denmark" title="Christian IV of Denmark">Christian IV</a> attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 <a href="/wiki/Kalmar_War" title="Kalmar War">Kalmar War</a> but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union.

King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably <a href="/wiki/Gl%C3%BCckstadt" title="Glückstadt">Glückstadt</a> (founded as a rival to <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Oslo" title="Oslo">Christiania</a>.

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a>, Christian tried to become the leader of the <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lutter" title="Battle of Lutter">Battle of Lutter</a>. The result was that the Catholic army under <a href="/wiki/Albrecht_von_Wallenstein" title="Albrecht von Wallenstein">Albrecht von Wallenstein</a> was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_L%C3%BCbeck" title="Treaty of Lübeck">to withdraw from the war</a>. Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but King <a href="/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden" title="Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus</a>' intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark's influence in the region was declining. In 1643, Swedish armies <a href="/wiki/Torstenson_War" title="Torstenson War">invaded Jutland</a> and claimed Scania in 1644.</p>
<p>In the 1645 <a href="/wiki/Second_Treaty_of_Br%C3%B6msebro_(1645)" title="Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)">Treaty of Brømsebro</a>, Denmark surrendered Halland, <a href="/wiki/Gotland" title="Gotland">Gotland</a>, the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway. In 1657, King <a href="/wiki/Frederick_III_of_Denmark" title="Frederick III of Denmark">Frederick III</a> declared war on Sweden and marched on <a href="/wiki/Bremen-Verden" title="Bremen-Verden">Bremen-Verden</a>. This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charles_X_Gustav" title="Charles X Gustav">Charles X Gustav</a> of Sweden conquered both <a href="/wiki/Jutland" title="Jutland">Jutland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Funen" title="Funen">Funen</a>, and much of <a href="/wiki/Zealand" title="Zealand">Zealand</a> before signing the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Roskilde" title="Treaty of Roskilde">Peace of Roskilde</a> in February 1658 which gave Sweden control of Scania, <a href="/wiki/Blekinge" title="Blekinge">Blekinge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tr%C3%B8ndelag" title="Trøndelag">Trøndelag</a>, and the island of <a href="/wiki/Bornholm" title="Bornholm">Bornholm</a>. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked Denmark and in August 1658, he began a two-year-long siege of <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> but failed to take the capital. In the following peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.</p>

<p>Denmark tried to regain control of Scania in the <a href="/wiki/Scanian_War" title="Scanian War">Scanian War</a> (1675–1679) but it ended in failure. Following the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern_War" title="Great Northern War">Great Northern War</a> (1700–21), Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Schleswig" title="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> and <a href="/wiki/Holstein" title="Holstein">Holstein</a> ruled by the house of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holstein-Gottorp" title="Holstein-Gottorp">Holstein-Gottorp</a> in 1721 and 1773, respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Country_neutrality_(international_relations)" title="Country neutrality (international relations)">neutral status</a> allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Denmark traded with both <a href="/wiki/First_French_Empire" title="First French Empire">France</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a> and joined the <a href="/wiki/Second_League_of_Armed_Neutrality" title="Second League of Armed Neutrality">League of Armed Neutrality</a> with <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russia</a>, Sweden, and <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Prussia</a>. The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen_(1801)" title="Battle of Copenhagen (1801)">1801</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen_(1807)" title="Battle of Copenhagen (1807)">1807</a>, in one case carrying off the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Danish_Navy" title="Royal Danish Navy">Danish fleet</a>, in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital. This led to the so-called Danish-British <a href="/wiki/Gunboat_War" title="Gunboat War">Gunboat War</a>. British control over the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" title="Bankruptcy">bankrupt</a>.</p>
<p>The Danish-Norwegian union was dissolved by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Kiel" title="Treaty of Kiel">Treaty of Kiel</a> in 1814; the Danish monarchy "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king. After the dissolution of the union with Norway, Denmark kept the possessions of <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> (which retained the Danish monarchy until 1944), the <a href="/wiki/Faroe_Islands" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, all of which had been governed by Norway for centuries. Apart from the Nordic colonies, Denmark continued to rule over <a href="/wiki/Danish_India" title="Danish India">Danish India</a> from 1620 to 1869, the <a href="/wiki/Danish_Gold_Coast" title="Danish Gold Coast">Danish Gold Coast</a> (Ghana) from 1658 to 1850, and the <a href="/wiki/Danish_West_Indies" title="Danish West Indies">Danish West Indies</a> from 1671 to 1917.</p>

<p>A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848" title="Revolutions of 1848">Revolutions of 1848</a>, Denmark peacefully became a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a <a href="/wiki/Rigsdagen" title="Rigsdagen">two-chamber parliament</a>. Denmark faced war against both <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habsburg_Austria" title="Habsburg Austria">Habsburg Austria</a> in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Second_Schleswig_War" title="Second Schleswig War">Second Schleswig War</a>, lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to <a href="/wiki/Cession" title="Cession">cede</a> <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Schleswig-Holstein" title="Province of Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig and Holstein</a> to <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century. After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">Industrialisation</a> came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century. The <a href="/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Denmark" title="History of rail transport in Denmark">nation's first railroads</a> were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">Trade unions</a> developed starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.</p>
<p>Denmark maintained its neutral stance during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. After the defeat of Germany, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Versailles powers</a> offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German <a href="/wiki/Irredentism" title="Irredentism">irredentism</a>, Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plebiscite" title="Plebiscite">plebiscite</a>; the two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Schleswig_Plebiscites" title="Schleswig Plebiscites">Schleswig Plebiscites</a> took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and 3,984 square kilometres (1,538 sq mi).</p>
<p>In 1939 Denmark signed a 10-year non-aggression pact with <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> but <a href="/wiki/Operation_Weser%C3%BCbung" title="Operation Weserübung">Germany invaded Denmark</a> on 9 April 1940 and the Danish government quickly surrendered. <a href="/wiki/Denmark_in_World_War_II" title="Denmark in World War II">World War II in Denmark</a> was characterised by economic co-operation with Germany until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and <a href="/wiki/Royal_Danish_Navy" title="Royal Danish Navy">its navy</a> scuttled most of its ships and sent many of its officers to Sweden, which was neutral. The <a href="/wiki/Danish_resistance_movement" title="Danish resistance movement">Danish resistance</a> performed a <a href="/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews" title="Rescue of the Danish Jews">rescue operation</a> that managed to evacuate several thousand <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Denmark" title="History of the Jews in Denmark">Jews</a> and their families to safety in Sweden before the Germans could send them to death camps. Some Danes supported <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> by joining the <a href="/wiki/National_Socialist_Workers%27_Party_of_Denmark" title="National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark">Danish Nazi Party</a> or volunteering to fight with Germany as part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frikorps_Danmark" title="Frikorps Danmark">Frikorps Danmark</a>. Iceland severed ties to Denmark and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Founding_of_the_republic_of_Iceland" title="Founding of the republic of Iceland">became an independent republic</a> in 1944; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liberation_of_Denmark" title="Liberation of Denmark">Germany surrendered</a> in May 1945; in 1948, the Faroe Islands gained <a href="/wiki/Home_rule" title="Home rule">home rule</a>; in 1949, Denmark became a founding member of <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a>.</p>

<p>Denmark was a founding member of <a href="/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association" title="European Free Trade Association">European Free Trade Association</a> (EFTA). During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Outer_Seven" title="Outer Seven">Outer Seven</a>, as opposed to the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Six" title="Inner Six">Inner Six</a> of what was then the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC). In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>) after a <a href="/wiki/Danish_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1972" title="Danish European Communities membership referendum, 1972">public referendum</a>.

<p>Constitutional change in 1953 led to a <a href="/wiki/Unicameralism" title="Unicameralism">single-chamber</a> parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Centre-left" title="Centre-left">centre-left</a> <a href="/wiki/Social_Democrats_(Denmark)" title="Social Democrats (Denmark)">Social Democrats</a> led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the <a href="/wiki/Nordic_model" title="Nordic model">Nordic welfare model</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<p>Denmark has a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperateness" title="Temperateness">temperate</a> climate, characterised by mild winters, with mean temperatures in January of 1.5 °C (34.7 °F), and cool summers, with a mean temperature in August of 17.2 °C (63.0 °F). The most extreme temperatures recorded in Denmark, since 1874 when recordings began, was 36.4 °C (97.5 °F) in 1975 and −31.02 °C (−23.84 °F) in 1982. Denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation, on average receiving a total of 765 millimetres (30 in) per year; autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest. The position between a continent and an ocean means that weather often changes.</p>
<p>Because of Denmark's northern location, there are large seasonal variations in daylight. There are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45 am and sunset 3:45 pm (standard time), as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30 am and sunset at 10 pm (<a href="/wiki/Daylight_saving_time" title="Daylight saving time">daylight saving time</a>).</p>

<p>Denmark belongs to the <a href="/wiki/Boreal_Kingdom" title="Boreal Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a> and can be subdivided into two <a href="/wiki/Ecoregion" title="Ecoregion">ecoregions</a>: the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests. Almost all of Denmark's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primeval_forest" title="Primeval forest">primeval temperate forests</a> have been destroyed or fragmented, chiefly for agricultural purposes during the last millennia. The deforestation has created large swaths of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heathland" title="Heathland">heathland</a> and devastating <a href="/wiki/Saltation_(geology)" title="Saltation (geology)">sand drifts</a>. In spite of this, there are several larger <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_growth_forest" title="Second growth forest">second growth woodlands</a> in the country and, in total, 12.9% of the land is now forested.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Roe_deer" title="Roe deer">Roe deer</a> occupy the countryside in growing numbers, and large-antlered <a href="/wiki/Red_deer" title="Red deer">red deer</a> can be found in the sparse woodlands of Jutland. Denmark is also home to smaller mammals, such as <a href="/wiki/European_polecat" title="European polecat">polecats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hares</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hedgehog" title="Hedgehog">hedgehogs</a>. Approximately 400 bird species inhabit Denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country. Large marine mammals include healthy populations of <a href="/wiki/Harbour_porpoise" title="Harbour porpoise">Harbour porpoise</a>, growing numbers of <a href="/wiki/Pinniped" title="Pinniped">pinnipeds</a> and occasional visits of large whales, including <a href="/wiki/Blue_whale" title="Blue whale">blue whales</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orca" title="Orca">orcas</a>. <a href="/wiki/Cod" title="Cod">Cod</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herring" title="Herring">herring</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plaice" title="Plaice">plaice</a> are abundant fish in Danish waters and form the basis for <a href="/wiki/Fishing_industry_in_Denmark" title="Fishing industry in Denmark">a large fishing industry</a>.</p>
<p>Land and water pollution are two of Denmark's most significant <a href="/wiki/Environmental_issue" title="Environmental issue">environmental issues</a>, although much of the country's household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled.

However, the national <a href="/wiki/Ecological_footprint" title="Ecological footprint">ecological footprint</a> is 8.26 global hectares per person, which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010. Contributing factors to this value are an exceptional high value for cropland but also a relatively high value for grazing land, which may be explained by the substantially high meat production in Denmark (115.8 kilograms (255 lb) meat annually per capita) and the large economic role of the meat and dairy industries. In December 2014, the <a href="/wiki/Climate_Change_Performance_Index" title="Climate Change Performance Index">Climate Change Performance Index</a> for 2015 placed Denmark at the top of the table, explaining that although emissions are still quite high, the country was able to implement effective climate protection policies.</p>

<p>Denmark, with a total area of 43,094 <a href="/wiki/Square_kilometre" title="Square kilometre">square kilometres</a> (16,639 sq mi), is divided into five administrative regions (<a href="/wiki/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a>: <span lang="da"><i>regioner</i></span>). The regions are further subdivided into <a href="/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Denmark" title="List of municipalities of Denmark">98 municipalities</a> (<i><span lang="da">kommuner</span></i>). The easternmost land in Denmark, the <a href="/wiki/Ertholmene" title="Ertholmene">Ertholmene</a> archipelago, with an area of 39 hectares (0.16 sq m), is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Denmark)" title="Ministry of Defence (Denmark)">Ministry of Defence</a>.</p>
<p>The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the sixteen <a href="/wiki/Counties_of_Denmark" title="Counties of Denmark">former counties</a>. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, reducing the number from 270. Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule. The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils, elected proportionally every four years; the most recent <a href="/wiki/Danish_local_elections,_2013" title="Danish local elections, 2013">Danish local elections</a> were held on 19 November 2013. Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout, including the <a href="/wiki/Police_of_Denmark" title="Police of Denmark">police districts</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Courts_of_Denmark" title="Courts of Denmark">court districts</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ward_(country_subdivision)" title="Ward (country subdivision)">electoral wards</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Regions">Regions</span></h3>
<p>The governing bodies of the regions are the <a href="/wiki/Local_government" title="Local government">regional councils</a> with forty-one members elected for four-year terms. The head of the council is the regional council chairman (<i><span lang="da">regionsrådsformand</span></i>), who is elected by the council. The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Health_care_in_Denmark" title="Health care in Denmark">national health service</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_services" title="Social services">social services</a> and <a href="/wiki/Regional_development" title="Regional development">regional development</a>. Unlike the counties they replaced, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is primarily financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 (<i><span lang="da">sundhedsbidrag</span></i>) combined with funds from both government and municipalities. From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Area" title="Area">area</a> and populations of the regions vary widely; for example, the <a href="/wiki/Capital_Region_of_Denmark" title="Capital Region of Denmark">Capital Region</a>, which encompasses the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_metropolitan_area" title="Copenhagen metropolitan area">Copenhagen metropolitan area</a> with the exception of the subtracted province East Zeeland but includes the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> island of <a href="/wiki/Bornholm" title="Bornholm">Bornholm</a>, has a population three times larger than that of <a href="/wiki/North_Denmark_Region" title="North Denmark Region">North Denmark Region</a>, which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern Jutland. Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities, such as <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_Municipality" title="Copenhagen Municipality">Copenhagen Municipality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frederiksberg_Municipality" title="Frederiksberg Municipality">Frederiksberg</a>, had been given a status equivalent to that of counties, making them first-level administrative divisions. These <i><a href="/wiki/Sui_generis" title="Sui generis">sui generis</a></i> municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Denmark is a <a href="/wiki/Unitary_state" title="Unitary state">unitary state</a> that comprises, in addition to Denmark proper, two <a href="/wiki/Autonomous_administrative_division" title="Autonomous administrative division">autonomous</a> constituent countries in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/North_Atlantic_Ocean" title="North Atlantic Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a>: <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Faroe_Islands" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>. They have been integrated parts of the <a href="/wiki/Danish_Realm" title="Danish Realm">Danish Realm</a> since the 18th century; however, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm have extensive political powers and have assumed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legislative" title="Legislative">legislative</a> and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields. The Faroe Islands gained <a href="/wiki/Home_rule" title="Home rule">home rule</a> in 1948 and Greenland in 1979, having previously had the status of <a href="/wiki/Counties_of_Denmark" title="Counties of Denmark">counties</a>.</p>
<p>The two territories have their own home governments and parliaments and are effectively <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self-governing" title="Self-governing">self-governing</a> in regards to domestic affairs. <a href="/wiki/High_Commissioner" title="High Commissioner">High Commissioners</a> (<i><span lang="da">Rigsombudsmand</span></i>) act as representatives of the Danish government in the Faroese <a href="/wiki/L%C3%B8gting" title="Løgting">Løgting</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Greenland" title="Parliament of Greenland">Greenlandic Parliament</a>, but they cannot vote.

<p>Politics in Denmark operates under a framework laid out in the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Denmark" title="Constitution of Denmark">Constitution of Denmark</a>. First written in 1849, it establishes a sovereign state in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, with a representative <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a>.

<p>The Danish Parliament is called the Folketing (<a href="/wiki/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a>: <span lang="da"><i>Folketinget</i></span>). It is the <a href="/wiki/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislature</a> of the Kingdom of Denmark, passing <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" title="Act of Parliament">Acts</a> that apply in Denmark and, in limited cases, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the <a href="/wiki/Government_budget" title="Government budget">state's budgets</a>, approving the state's accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international cooperation. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law)" title="Bill (proposed law)">Bills</a> may be initiated by the Government or by <a href="/wiki/Member_of_parliament" title="Member of parliament">members of parliament</a>. All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Assent" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a> within thirty days in order to become law.</p>

<p>Denmark is a <a href="/wiki/Representative_democracy" title="Representative democracy">representative democracy</a> with <a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage" title="Universal suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. Membership of the Folketing is based on <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a> of political parties, with a 2% electoral threshold. Danes elect 175 members to the Folketing, with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the Prime Minister to ask the Monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a <a href="/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence" title="Motion of no confidence">vote of no confidence</a>, the Folketing may force a single minister or the entire government to resign.</p>
<p>The Government of Denmark operates as a <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_(government)" title="Cabinet (government)">cabinet government</a>, where executive authority is exercised—formally on behalf of the Monarch—by Prime Minister and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cabinet_minister" title="Cabinet minister">cabinet ministers</a>, who head <a href="/wiki/List_of_Danish_government_ministries" title="List of Danish government ministries">ministries</a>. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the <a href="/wiki/Confidence_and_supply" title="Confidence and supply">confidence</a> of a majority in the Folketing; this is usually the current leader of the largest <a href="/wiki/Political_party" title="Political party">political party</a> or, more effectively, through a <a href="/wiki/Political_alliance" title="Political alliance">coalition of parties</a>. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coalition_governments" title="Coalition governments">coalition governments</a>, themselves sometimes <a href="/wiki/Minority_government" title="Minority government">minority governments</a> dependent on non-government parties.</p>

<p>The judicial system of Denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law" title="Criminal law">criminal</a> jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Articles sixty-two and sixty-four of the Constitution ensure <a href="/wiki/Judicial_independence" title="Judicial independence">judicial independence</a> from government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes and practice. The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark has one system, Greenland another, and the Faroe Islands a third. However, decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Denmark" title="Supreme Court of Denmark">Danish Supreme Court</a> is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Denmark wields considerable influence in Northern Europe and is a <a href="/wiki/Middle_power" title="Middle power">middle power</a> in international affairs. In recent years, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing, <a href="/wiki/Whaling" title="Whaling">whaling</a>, and geopolitical concerns.

Denmark held the <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Presidency of the Council of the European Union">Presidency of the Council of the European Union</a> on seven occasions, most recently from January to June 2012.

It has been a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) since 1949, and membership remains highly popular.</p>
<p>As a member of <a href="/wiki/Development_Assistance_Committee" title="Development Assistance Committee">Development Assistance Committee</a> (DAC), Denmark has for a long time been among the countries of the world, contributing the largest percentage of gross national income to <a href="/wiki/Development_aid" title="Development aid">development aid</a>.

<p>Denmark is a long-time supporter of international <a href="/wiki/Peacekeeping" title="Peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a>, but since the <a href="/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia" title="NATO bombing of Yugoslavia">NATO bombing of Yugoslavia</a> in 1999 and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%9314)" title="War in Afghanistan (2001–14)">War in Afghanistan</a> in 2001, Denmark has also found a new role as a warring nation, participating actively in several wars and invasions. This relatively new situation has stirred some internal critique, but the Danish population has generally been very supportive, in particular of the War in Afghanistan.

<p>Once a predominantly <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> country on account of its <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">arable</a> landscape, since 1945 Denmark has greatly expanded its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_base" title="Industrial base">industrial base</a> so that by 2006 industry contributed about 25% of GDP and agriculture less than 2%.

Even when other countries, such as Germany and France, raised protection for their agricultural sector because of increased American competition resulting in much lower agricultural prices after 1870, Denmark retained its free trade policies, as the country profited from the cheap imports of cereals (used as feedstuffs for their cattle and pigs) and could increase their exports of butter and meat of which the prices were more stable.

<p>Denmark's currency, the <i><a href="/wiki/Danish_krone" title="Danish krone">krone</a></i> (DKK), is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate" title="Fixed exchange rate">pegged</a> at approximately 7.46 kroner per euro through the <a href="/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism" title="European Exchange Rate Mechanism">ERM</a>. Although a <a href="/wiki/Danish_euro_referendum,_2000" title="Danish euro referendum, 2000">September 2000 referendum</a> rejected adopting the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a>, the country follows the policies set forth in the <a href="/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union" title="Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union">Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union</a> and meets the economic <a href="/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria" title="Euro convergence criteria">convergence criteria</a> needed to adopt the euro.

As a result of its acclaimed "flexicurity" model, Denmark has the most free <a href="/wiki/Labour_economics" title="Labour economics">labour market</a> in Europe, according to the World Bank. Employers can hire and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs, <a href="/wiki/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> compensation is very high (security). Establishing a business can be done in a matter of hours and at very low costs. No restrictions apply regarding overtime work, which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Denmark has a competitive <a href="/wiki/Corporate_tax" title="Corporate tax">corporate tax</a> rate of 24.5% and a special time-limited tax regime for expatriates. The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25% <a href="/wiki/Value-added_tax" title="Value-added tax">value-added tax</a>, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) is estimated to be 46% in 2011.</p>
<p>As of 2014, 6% of the population was reported to live below the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Poverty_line" title="Poverty line">poverty line</a>, when adjusted for taxes and transfers. Denmark has the 2nd lowest relative poverty rate in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a>, below the 11.3% OECD average. The share of the population reporting that they feel that they cannot afford to buy sufficient food in Denmark is less than half of the OECD average. With an employment rate of 72.8%, Denmark ranks 7th highest among the OECD countries, and above the OECD average of 66.2%. The number of unemployed people is forecast to be 65,000 in 2015. The number of people in the <a href="/wiki/Legal_working_age" title="Legal working age">working age</a> group, less disability pensioners etc., will grow by 10,000 to 2,860,000, and jobs by 70,000 to 2,790,000; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Part-time" title="Part-time">part-time</a> jobs are included. Because of the present high demand and short supply of skilled labour, for instance for factory and service jobs, including hospital nurses and physicians, the annual average <a href="/wiki/Working_time" title="Working time">working hours</a> have risen, especially compared with the <a href="/wiki/Recession" title="Recession">recession</a> 1987–1993.

<p>The level of <a href="/wiki/Unemployment_benefits" title="Unemployment benefits">unemployment benefits</a> is dependent on former employment (the maximum benefit is at 90% of the wage) and at times also on membership of an unemployment fund, which is almost always—but need not be—administered by a trade union, and the previous payment of contributions.

<p>Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport.

However, this has had little effect, and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars, as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes.

The <a href="/wiki/World_Happiness_Report" title="World Happiness Report">World Happiness Report</a> frequently ranks Denmark's population as the happiest in the world. This has been attributed to the country's highly regarded education and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Health_care_in_Denmark" title="Health care in Denmark">health care</a> systems, and its low level of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Income_inequality" title="Income inequality">income inequality</a>.</p>
<p>Denmark is an historically <a href="/wiki/Homogeneity_(statistics)" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneous</a> nation. However, as with its Scandinavian neighbours, Denmark has recently transformed from a nation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Net_migration" title="Net migration">net emigration</a>, up until World War II, to a nation of net immigration. Today, <a href="/wiki/Immigration_to_Denmark" title="Immigration to Denmark">immigration to Denmark</a> consists particularly of <a href="/wiki/Asylum_seeker" title="Asylum seeker">asylum seekers</a> and persons who arrive as family dependants. In addition, Denmark annually receives a number of citizens from <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">Western countries</a>, notably Nordic countries, the EU, and North America, who seek residency to work or study for a definite period of time. Recently, substantial numbers of workers—several tens of thousands—from the <a href="/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="2004 enlargement of the European Union">new EU accession countries</a>, especially Poland and the Baltic nations, have arrived to perform menial labour in construction, agriculture, consumer industries, and cleaning.

<p>Danish <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">mass media</a> date back to the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, <a href="/wiki/Anders_Bording" title="Anders Bording">Anders Bording</a>, the father of Danish journalism, began a <a href="/wiki/State_media" title="State media">state paper</a>. In 1834, the first liberal, factual newspaper appeared, and the 1849 Constitution established lasting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_Denmark" title="Freedom of the press in Denmark">freedom of the press in Denmark</a>. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or trade union. Modernisation, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_occupation_of_Denmark" title="German occupation of Denmark">German occupation</a> during World War II brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis. During the war, the underground produced 550 newspapers—small, surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance.</p>

<p>Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of product due largely to funding by the state-supported <a href="/wiki/Danish_Film_Institute" title="Danish Film Institute">Danish Film Institute</a>. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the <a href="/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent era</a>; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the <a href="/wiki/Dogme_95" title="Dogme 95">Dogme 95</a> movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker <a href="/wiki/Carl_Theodor_Dreyer" title="Carl Theodor Dreyer">Carl Th.

From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance_architecture" title="Renaissance architecture">Renaissance</a> style. During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the <a href="/wiki/Baroque_architecture" title="Baroque architecture">Baroque</a> style, both in the capital and the provinces. <a href="/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture" title="Neoclassical architecture">Neoclassicism</a> from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style.
