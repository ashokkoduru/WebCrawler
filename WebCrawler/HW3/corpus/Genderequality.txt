<p><b>Gender equality</b>, also known as <b>sex equality</b>, <b>gender egalitarianism</b>, <b>sexual equality</b>, or <b>equality of the genders</b>, is the view that everyone should receive <a href="/wiki/Social_equality" title="Social equality">equal treatment</a> and not be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gender_discrimination" title="Gender discrimination">discriminated against based on their gender</a>. This is one of the objectives of the United Nations <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, which seeks to create equality in law and in social situations, such as in <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democratic</a> activities and securing <a href="/wiki/Equal_pay_for_equal_work" title="Equal pay for equal work">equal pay for equal work</a>. In practice, the objective of gender equality is for people to acquire, if they so choose, equal treatment throughout a society, not just in politics, the workplace, or any other policy-designated sphere. To avoid complication, <a href="/wiki/Third_gender" title="Third gender">genders besides women and men</a> will <i>not</i> be discussed in this article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>An early advocate for gender equality was <a href="/wiki/Christine_de_Pizan" title="Christine de Pizan">Christine de Pizan</a>, who in her 1405 book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Book_of_the_City_of_Ladies" title="The Book of the City of Ladies">The Book of the City of Ladies</a></i> wrote that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Shakers" title="Shakers">Shakers</a></div>

<p>As a group, the <a href="/wiki/Shakers" title="Shakers">Shakers</a>, an evangelical group which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict <a href="/wiki/Celibacy" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a>, were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quaker" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal, so he brought <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Wright" title="Lucy Wright">Lucy Wright</a> into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or otherwise owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright was the head of the Shaker ministry until her own death in 1821.</p>
<p>Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were "the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand". Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:</p>

<p>The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. They showed that equality could be achieved and how to do it.</p>
<p>In the wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the <a href="/wiki/Suffragette" title="Suffragette">suffrage movement</a> in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_property_rights" title="Women's property rights">women's property rights</a>, particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, <a href="/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Act_1882" title="Married Women's Property Act 1882">Married Women's Property Act 1882</a>.)</p>

<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, a more general movement for gender equality developed based on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Women%27s_liberation" title="Women's liberation">women's liberation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Feminism" title="Feminism">feminism</a>.

<li>The <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Europe" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a>'s <i>Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017</i>, which has five strategic objectives:</li>
</ul>

<p>Such <a href="/wiki/Legislation" title="Legislation">legislation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> policies have been critical to bringing about changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least "somewhat important," and a global median of 65% believe it is "very important" that women have the same rights as men. Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries. For example, many countries now permit women to serve in the <a href="/wiki/Armed_forces" title="Armed forces">armed forces</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police forces</a> and to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fire_fighter" title="Fire fighter">fire fighters</a> – occupations traditionally reserved for men. Although these continue to be male dominated occupations an increasing number of women are now active, especially in directive fields such as politics, and occupy high positions in business.</p>
<p>Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_work" title="Women's work">women's work</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Nursing" title="Nursing">nursing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maid" title="Maid">cleaning</a> and <a href="/wiki/Child_care" title="Child care">child care</a>. In domestic situations, the role of <a href="/wiki/Parenting" title="Parenting">Parenting</a> or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a <a href="/wiki/Career" title="Career">career</a> after <a href="/wiki/Childbirth" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a>. For further information, see <a href="/wiki/Shared_earning/shared_parenting_marriage" title="Shared earning/shared parenting marriage">Shared earning/shared parenting marriage</a>.</p>
<p>Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names#Feminism_and_preserving_one.27s_personal_name" title="Married and maiden names">non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage</a>.</p>
<p>A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in <a href="/wiki/Religious_law" title="Religious law">religiously orientated societies</a>. For example, <a href="/wiki/Cairo_Declaration_on_Human_Rights_in_Islam#Contents" title="Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam">the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam</a> declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights, and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries. In some <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian churches</a>, the practice of <a href="/wiki/Churching_of_women" title="Churching of women">churching of women</a> may still have elements of <a href="/wiki/Ritual_purification" title="Ritual purification">ritual purification</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ordination_of_women" title="Ordination of women">Ordination of women</a> to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden. Some Christians or Muslims believe in <a href="/wiki/Complementarianism" title="Complementarianism">Complementarianism</a>, a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion_and_female_infanticide#Cultural_preference" title="Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide">cultural preference for a male child</a> has resulted in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Missing_women_of_Asia" title="Missing women of Asia">shortfall of women</a> in the population. <a href="/wiki/Feminism_in_Japan" title="Feminism in Japan">The feminist movement in Japan</a> has made many strides and has resulted in Rethe <a href="/wiki/Gender_Equality_Bureau" title="Gender Equality Bureau">Gender Equality Bureau</a>, but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.</p>
<p>The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex, because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in <i>certain</i> areas of life but not in other areas. An example is <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, which has offered very high opportunities to women in public/professional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of <a href="/wiki/Violence_against_women" title="Violence against women">violence against women</a>, with the situation in this country having been called a <a href="/wiki/Paradox" title="Paradox">paradox</a>. <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> received harsh criticism for inadequate laws in regard to <a href="/wiki/Sexual_violence" title="Sexual violence">sexual violence</a> in a 2008 report produced by <a href="/wiki/Amnesty_International" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, which described Danish laws as "inconsistent with international human rights standards". This led to Denmark reforming its sexual offenses legislation in 2013. Indeed, there is a need of caution when categorizing countries by the level of gender equality that they have achieved. According to Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon "gender policy is not one issue but many" and:</p>

<p>Not all ideas for gender equality have been popularly adopted. For example: <a href="/wiki/Topfreedom" title="Topfreedom">topfreedom</a>, the right to be bare breasted in public, frequently applies only to males and has remained a marginal issue. <a href="/wiki/Breastfeeding_in_public" title="Breastfeeding in public">Breastfeeding in public</a> is more commonly tolerated, especially in semi-private places such as restaurants.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gender_biases">Gender biases</span></h2>
<p>There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of "progress" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men, and that official public policies (such as sate policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of the male dominated system. One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular those of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.</p>
<p>A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of "othering" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the "violent others" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures. These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world. They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in <a href="/wiki/Family_law" title="Family law">family law</a> in the 1980s. Another criticism is that there is a selective public discourse with regard to different types of oppression of women, with some forms of violence such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Honor_killings" title="Honor killings">honor killings</a> (most common in certain geographic regions such as parts of Asia and North Africa) being frequently the object of public debate, while other forms of violence, such as the lenient punishment for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crimes_of_passion" title="Crimes of passion">crimes of passion</a> across <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, do not receive the same attention in the West. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for <a href="/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, pointed out that "crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived [in those relevant parts of the world] as excusable or understandable". It is also argued that the criticism of particular laws of many developing countries ignores the influence of <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> on those legal systems, especially of the French <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Code" title="Napoleonic Code">Napoleonic Code</a>, which was extremely powerful in its influence over the world (historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world) and which designated married women a subordinate role, and provided for leniency with regard to 'crimes of passion' (which was the case in France until 1975).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Gender_inequality" title="Gender inequality">Gender inequality</a></div>
<p>World bodies have defined gender equality in terms of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_rights" title="Women's rights">women's rights</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a>. <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> describes that gender equality "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike."</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFPA" title="UNFPA">UNFPA</a> stated that, "despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence."</p>
<p>Thus, promoting gender equality is seen as an encouragement to greater <a href="/wiki/Prosperity" title="Prosperity">economic prosperity</a>. For example, nations of the <a href="/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a> that deny equality of opportunity to women were warned in a 2008 <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>-sponsored report that this disempowerment is a critical factor crippling these nations' return to the first rank of global leaders in commerce, <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">learning</a> and <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">culture</a>. That is, Western bodies are less likely to conduct commerce with nations in the Middle East that retain culturally accepted attitudes towards the status and function of women in their society in an effort to <a href="/wiki/Cultural_globalization" title="Cultural globalization">force them to change their beliefs</a> in the face of relatively underdeveloped economies.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> opened the <a href="/wiki/European_Institute_for_Gender_Equality" title="European Institute for Gender Equality">European Institute for Gender Equality</a> (EIGE) in <a href="/wiki/Vilnius" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> to promote gender equality and to fight <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sex_discrimination" title="Sex discrimination">sex discrimination</a>.</p>

<p>A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Violence_against_women" title="Violence against women">Violence against women</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Violence_against_women" title="Violence against women">Violence against women</a> is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly <i>because</i> they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs. The UN <a href="/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Elimination_of_Violence_Against_Women" title="Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women">Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a> defines violence against women as "<i>any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life</i>" and states that:</p>

<p>According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on IPV victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.</p>
<p>Forms of violence against women include <a href="/wiki/Sexual_violence" title="Sexual violence">sexual violence</a> (including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_rape" title="War rape">war rape</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marital_rape" title="Marital rape">marital rape</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Date_rape_by_drugs_or_alcohol&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Date rape by drugs or alcohol (page does not exist)">date rape by drugs or alcohol</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse" title="Child sexual abuse">child sexual abuse</a>, the latter often in the context of <a href="/wiki/Child_marriage" title="Child marriage">child marriage</a>), <a href="/wiki/Domestic_violence" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forced_marriage" title="Forced marriage">forced marriage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation" title="Female genital mutilation">female genital mutilation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forced_prostitution" title="Forced prostitution">forced prostitution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sex_trafficking" title="Sex trafficking">sex trafficking</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honor_killing" title="Honor killing">honor killings</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dowry_killing" title="Dowry killing">dowry killings</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Acid_attacks" title="Acid attacks">acid attacks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stoning" title="Stoning">stoning</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flogging" title="Flogging">flogging</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forced_sterilization" title="Forced sterilization">forced sterilization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forced_abortion" title="Forced abortion">forced abortion</a>, violence related to accusations of <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, mistreatment of widows (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Widow_inheritance" title="Widow inheritance">widow inheritance</a>). Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issues for achieving gender equality. The Council of Europe adopted the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_preventing_and_combating_violence_against_women_and_domestic_violence" title="Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence">Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence</a> (Istanbul Convention).</p>
<p>In Western countries which are overall safe (i.e. where gang murders, armed kidnappings, civil unrest, and other similar acts are rare) the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partners/ex-partners: as of 2004-2009, former and current partners were responsible for more than 80% of all cases of <a href="/wiki/Femicide" title="Femicide">murders of women</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. By contrast, in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere, often in a general climate of indifference and impunity. In addition, many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders, aggravating the problem.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life; according to UNFPA:</p>

<p>In most countries, it is only in recent decades that violence against women (in particular when committed in the family) has received significant legal attention. The <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_preventing_and_combating_violence_against_women_and_domestic_violence" title="Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence">Istanbul Convention</a> acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, this form of violence. In its <a class="external text" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm" rel="nofollow">explanatory report</a> at para 219, it states:</p>

<p>In <i>Opuz v Turkey</i>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> recognized violence against women as a form discrimination against women, para 200: "[T]he Court considers that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother may be regarded as <i>gender-based violence which is a form of discrimination against women</i>." This is also the position of the Istanbul Convention which reads:</p>

<p>In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family.

<p>The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_World_Conference_on_Women" title="Fourth World Conference on Women">Fourth World Conference on Women</a> in Beijing and the UN <a href="/wiki/International_Conference_on_Population_and_Development" title="International Conference on Population and Development">International Conference on Population and Development</a> Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against <a href="/wiki/HIV/AIDS" title="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maternal_mortality" title="Maternal mortality">Maternal mortality</a> is a major problem in many parts of the world. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFPA" title="UNFPA">UNFPA</a> states that countries have an obligation to protect women's right to health, but many countries do not do that. Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFPA" title="UNFPA">UNFPA</a> says that, "since 1990, the world has seen a 45 per cent decline in maternal mortality – an enormous achievement. But in spite of these gains, almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes." According to UNFPA:</p>

<p>The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forced_sterilization" title="Forced sterilization">forced sterilization</a>, forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Forced_marriage" title="Forced marriage">forced marriage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Child_marriage" title="Child marriage">child marriage</a>), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sex_outside_marriage" title="Sex outside marriage">sex outside marriage</a>), lack of criminalization of <a href="/wiki/Marital_rape" title="Marital rape">marital rape</a>, violence in regard to the choice of partner (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Honor_killings" title="Honor killings">honor killings</a> as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations). Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death." All these practices infringe on the right of achieving reproductive and sexual health. High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/wiki/Navi_Pillay" title="Navi Pillay">Navi Pillay</a> has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating:</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adolescent" title="Adolescent">Adolescent</a> girls are at the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors (females' risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males').</p>
<p>Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common; according to the WHO: "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence." The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Richard_A._Posner" title="Richard A. Posner">Richard A. Posner</a> writes that "Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wife's chastity or his daughter's virginity". Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the <a href="/wiki/Family_honor" title="Family honor">honor of the family</a>, rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members. <a href="/wiki/Catharine_MacKinnon" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a> argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences; she writes "To know what is wrong with rape, know what is right about sex. If this, in turn, is difficult, the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one. Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse, while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance."</p>
<p>One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex, and men are seen as entitled to their bodies, until and unless women object. Rebecca Cook wrote in <i>Submission of Interights to the European Court of Human Rights in the case of <a href="/wiki/M.C._v._Bulgaria" title="M.C. v. Bulgaria">M.C. v.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_movement" title="Freedom of movement">Freedom of movement</a></div>
<p>The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies and has varied by culture, historical era, social class and other other socioeconomic characteristics. <a href="/wiki/Seclusion" title="Seclusion">Seclusion</a> of women within the home was a common practise among the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Upper_classes" title="Upper classes">upper classes</a> of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century is was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain. </p>
<p>Women's <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_movement" title="Freedom of movement">freedom of movement</a> continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marriage_laws" title="Marriage laws">marriage laws</a>. For instance, in <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission. In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.</p>
<p>The CEDAW states at Article 15 (4) that:</p>

<p>In addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms - for example <a href="/wiki/Purdah" title="Purdah">purdah</a>, a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> as well as upper-caste Hindus in <a href="/wiki/North_India" title="North India">Northern India</a>, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rajputs" title="Rajputs">Rajputs</a>, which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions; or <a href="/wiki/Namus" title="Namus">namus</a>, a cultural concept strongly related to <a href="/wiki/Family_honor" title="Family honor">family honor</a>.</p>
<p>The custom of <a href="/wiki/Bride_price" title="Bride price">bride price</a> can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.</p>
<p>Restrictions on freedom of movement also exist due to traditional practices such as <a href="/wiki/Baad_(practice)" title="Baad (practice)">baad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Swara_(custom)" title="Swara (custom)">swara</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Vani_(custom)" title="Vani (custom)">vani</a>, common especially among <a href="/wiki/Pashtun_tribes" title="Pashtun tribes">Pashtun tribes</a> in Pakistan and Afghanistan, whereby a girl is given from one family to another (often though a marriage), in order to settle the disputes and feuds between the families. The girl, who now belongs to the second family, has very little autonomy and freedom, her role being to serve the new family.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gendered_arrangements_of_work_and_care">Gendered arrangements of work and care</span></h3>
<p>Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role. Policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers as a tool of changing gender relations. <a href="/wiki/Shared_earning/shared_parenting_marriage" title="Shared earning/shared parenting marriage">Shared earning/shared parenting marriage</a>, that is, a relationship where the partners collaborate at sharing their responsibilities inside and outside of the home, is often encouraged in Western countries.</p>
<p>Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe - parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland; as well as the Netherlands and Ireland. In 2011, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jose_Manuel_Barroso" title="Jose Manuel Barroso">Jose Manuel Barroso</a>, then president of the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce". The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals; despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the <a href="/wiki/European_Communities" title="European Communities">European Communities</a> report <i>Women in the European Community</i>, found that the Netherlands and Ireland had the lowest labour particupation of married women and the most public disapproval of it. In Ireland, until 1973, there was a <a href="/wiki/Marriage_bar" title="Marriage bar">marriage bar</a>. In the Netherlands, from the 1990s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but with most of the women <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Part_time_job" title="Part time job">working part time</a>. As of 2014, the Netherlands and Switzerland were the only OECD members where most employed women worked part-time, while in the United Kingdom, women made up two thirds of workers on long term sick leave, despite making up only half of the workforce and even after excluding maternity leave.</p>
<p>A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maternity_rights" title="Maternity rights">maternity rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_rights" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a> of women. Different countries have different rules regarding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maternity_leave" title="Maternity leave">maternity leave</a>, paternity leave and parental leave. In the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU) the policies vary significantly by country, but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pregnant_Workers_Directive" title="Pregnant Workers Directive">Pregnant Workers Directive</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parental_Leave_Directive" title="Parental Leave Directive">Parental Leave Directive</a>. Another important issue refers to ensuring that employed women are not <i><a href="/wiki/De_jure" title="De jure">de jure</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> prevented from having a child. For example, some countries have enacted legislation explicitly outlawing or restricting what they view as abusive clauses in <a href="/wiki/Employment_contract" title="Employment contract">employment contracts</a> regarding reproductive rights (for example clauses which stipulate that a woman cannot get pregnant during a specified time) rendering such contracts <a href="/wiki/Void_(law)" title="Void (law)">void</a> or <a href="/wiki/Voidable" title="Voidable">voidable</a>. In some countries, employers who request women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant face legal punishment. Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers; and the <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" title="International Labour Organization">International Labour Organization</a> classifies <a href="/wiki/Forced_abortion" title="Forced abortion">forced abortion</a> coerced by the employer as <a href="/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour" title="Exploitation of labour">labour exploitation</a>. Being the victim of a forced abortion compelled by the employer was ruled a ground of obtaining <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Political_asylum" title="Political asylum">political asylum</a> in the US. Other abuses include routine <a href="/wiki/Virginity_test" title="Virginity test">virginity tests</a> of unmarried employed women.</p>

<p>In many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles that include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms. According to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OHCHR" title="OHCHR">OHCHR</a>, there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009-2014 with "a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education".

<p>Women are underrepresented in most countries' National Parliaments. The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women’s political participation called for female participation in politics, and expressed concern about the fact that "women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere". The Council of Europe states that:</p>

<p>Institutions also play an essential role in achieving and enforcing gender equality. However, basic legal and human rights, access to and the control of resources, employment and earnings and social and political participation are still not guaranteed in many social and legal institutions. For example, only 22 per cent of parliamentarians globally are women and therefore, men continue to occupy most positions of political and legal authority. As of November 2014, women accounted for 28% of members of the single or lower houses of parliaments in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> member states.</p>
<p>In some Western countries women have only recently <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage" title="Women's suffrage">obtained the right to vote</a>, notably in <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of <a href="/wiki/Appenzell_Innerrhoden" title="Appenzell Innerrhoden">Appenzell Innerrhoden</a> women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Supreme_Court_of_Switzerland" title="Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Liechtenstein" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>, women were given the right to vote by the <a href="/wiki/Liechtenstein_women%27s_suffrage_referendum,_1984" title="Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984">women's suffrage referendum of 1984</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Female_economic_activity" title="Female economic activity">Female economic activity</a> is a common measure of gender equality in an economy. <a href="/wiki/UN_Women" title="UN Women">UN Women</a> states that: "Investing in women’s economic empowerment sets a direct path towards gender equality, poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth."</p>
<p>Gender discrimination often results in women ending in insecure, low-wage jobs, and being disproportionately affected by poverty, discrimination and exploitation.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Population_Fund" title="UN Population Fund">UN Population Fund</a> says that, "Six out of 10 of the world’s poorest people are women. Economic disparities persist partly because much of the unpaid work within families and communities falls on the shoulders of women, and because women continue to face discrimination in the economic sphere."</p>
<p>Gender biases also exist in product and service provision.  The term "Women's Tax", also known as "Pink Tax", refers to gendered pricing in which products or services marketed to women are more expensive than similar products marketed to men. <a href="/wiki/Gender-based_price_discrimination" title="Gender-based price discrimination">Gender-based price discrimination</a> involves companies selling almost identical units of the same product or service at comparatively different prices, as determined by the target market. Studies have found that women pay about $1,400 a year more than men due to gendered discriminatory pricing. Although the "pink tax" of different goods and services is not uniform, overall women pay more for commodities that result in visual evidence of feminine body image. For example, studies have shown that women are charged more for services especially tailoring, hair cutting and laundering.</p>
<p>A growing body of research documents what works to economically empower women, from providing access to formal financial services to training on agricultural and business management practices, though more research is needed across a variety of contexts to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marriage.2C_divorce_and_property_laws_and_regulations">Marriage, divorce and property laws and regulations</span></h3>
<p>Equal rights for women in marriage, divorce, and property/land ownership and inheritance are essential for gender equality. CEDAW has called for the end of discriminatory <a href="/wiki/Family_law" title="Family law">family laws</a>. In 2013, UNWomen stated that "While at least 115 countries recognize equal land rights for women and men, effective implementation remains a major challenge".</p>
<p>The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards. <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Subjection_of_Women" title="The Subjection of Women">The Subjection of Women</a></i> (1869) compared marriage to <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and wrote that: "The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out." In 1957, James Everett, then Minister for Justice in Ireland, stated: "The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women". Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marriage_laws" title="Marriage laws">marriage laws</a> giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through <a href="/wiki/Marriage_bar" title="Marriage bar">marriage bars</a>. In France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965; while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property. In <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983, abolishing the restrictions on married women's right to work outside the home, providing for equality between spouses, and for joint ownership of property and assets. <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a <a href="/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland" title="Voting in Switzerland">referendum</a>, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). In the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, although the legal incapacity of a married woman was abolished in 1956, the marriage bar for women civil servants being lifted in 1957, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family. In 1978, the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Europe" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a> passed the <i>Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law</i>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the wife's legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of <i><a href="/wiki/Kirchberg_v._Feenstra" title="Kirchberg v. Feenstra">Kirchberg v. Feenstra</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_450" title="List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 450">450</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Reports" title="United States Reports">U.S.</a> 455 (1981), a <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">United States Supreme Court</a> case in which the Court held a <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> <a href="/wiki/Head_and_Master_law" title="Head and Master law">Head and Master law</a>, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.</p>
<p>There have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, until 1983 a husband had to authorise the application by a married woman for a passport. Other practices have included, and in many countries continue to include, a requirement for a husband's consent for an application for bank loans and credit cards by a married woman, as well as restrictions on the wife's <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_rights" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a>, such as a requirement that the husband consents to the wife's acquiring of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contraception" title="Contraception">contraception</a> or having an <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. In some places, although the law itself no longer requires the consent of the husband for various actions taken by the wife, the practice continues <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a></i>, with the authorization of the husband being asked in practice.</p>
<p>Although <a href="/wiki/Dowry" title="Dowry">dowry</a> is today associated with <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>, the practice has been common until the mid-20th century in parts of <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Europe" title="Southeast Europe">Southeast Europe</a>. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> dowry was removed from <a href="/wiki/Family_law" title="Family law">family law</a> only in 1983 through legal changes which reformed marriage law and provided gender equality in marriage. These changes also dealt with the practice of women <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">changing their surnames to that of the husbands</a> upon getting married, a practice which has been outlawed or restricted in some jurisdictions, because it is seen as contrary to women's rights. As such, women in Greece are required to <i>keep</i> their birth names for their whole life.</p>
<p>Laws regulating marriage and divorce continue to discriminate against women in many countries. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission. In <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives, with paragraph 41 of the criminal code stating that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom". In the 1990s and the 21st century there has been progress in many countries in Africa: for instance in Namibia the <a href="/wiki/Marital_power" title="Marital power">marital power</a> of the husband was abolished in 1996 by the <i>Married Persons Equality Act</i>; in Botswana it was abolished in 2004 by the <i>Abolition of Marital Power Act</i>; and in Lesotho it was abolished in 2006 by the <i>Married Persons Equality Act</i>.</p>
<p>Violence and mistreatment of women in relation to marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage (<a href="/wiki/Domestic_violence" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a>) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as <a href="/wiki/Dowry" title="Dowry">dowry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bride_price" title="Bride price">bride price</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forced_marriage" title="Forced marriage">forced marriage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Child_marriage" title="Child marriage">child marriage</a>). Violence against a wife continues to be seen as legally acceptable in some countries; for instance in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The criminalization of <a href="/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">adultery</a> has been criticized as being a prohibition, which, in law or in practice, is used primarily against women; and incites violence against women (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crimes_of_passion" title="Crimes of passion">crimes of passion</a>, honor killings). A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice in 2012 stated: "the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice is deeply concerned at the criminalization and penalization of adultery whose enforcement leads to discrimination and violence against women." UN Women also stated that "Drafters should repeal any criminal offenses related to adultery or extramarital sex between consenting adults".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Investigation_and_prosecution_of_crimes_against_women_and_girls">Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls</span></h3>
<p>Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal <a href="/wiki/Impunity" title="Impunity">impunity</a> of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities. This is especially the case with murders of women in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. In particular, there is impunity in regard to <a href="/wiki/Domestic_violence" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a>. High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="/wiki/Navi_Pillay" title="Navi Pillay">Navi Pillay</a>, has stated on domestic violence against women:</p>

<p>Women are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UNWomen has said that, "Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice". Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence - according to Amnesty International, "Women who are victims of gender-related violence often have little recourse because many state agencies are themselves guilty of gender bias and discriminatory practices."</p>

<p>Gender <a href="/wiki/Stereotype" title="Stereotype">stereotypes</a> arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace.In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being "supportive" or "nurturing", while their male counterparts are seen as being "assertive" or "ambitious".  Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace. </p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Gender_role" title="Gender role">gender role</a> is a set of societal <a href="/wiki/Norm_(social)" title="Norm (social)">norms</a> dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of <a href="/wiki/Femininity" title="Femininity">femininity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Masculinity" title="Masculinity">masculinity</a>, although there are <a href="/wiki/Third_gender" title="Third gender">exceptions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Genderqueer" title="Genderqueer">variations</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_preventing_and_combating_violence_against_women_and_domestic_violence" title="Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence">Istanbul Convention</a> contains a definition of "gender", stating that: "“gender” shall mean the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men". (Article 3–Definitions (c))</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Harmful_traditional_practices">Harmful traditional practices</span></h3>


<p>"Harmful traditional practices" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected. They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities. These practices include, according to the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights" title="Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights">Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</a>:</p>

<p>Female genital mutilation is defined as "procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons". An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in two countries, Egypt and Ethiopia. It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFPA" title="UNFPA">UNFPA</a> and <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> state that, "In every society where it is practiced, FGM is a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities, whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim, the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs. Because FGM may be considered an important part of a culture or identity, it can be difficult for families to decide against having their daughters cut. People who reject the practice may face condemnation or ostracism. Even parents who do not want their daughters to undergo FGM may feel compelled to participate in the practice."</p>
<p>Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.</p>
<p>Early marriage, child marriage or <a href="/wiki/Forced_marriage" title="Forced marriage">forced marriage</a> is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23. Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.</p>
<p>The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that "Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]". Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, "one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18." <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFPA" title="UNFPA">UNFPA</a> states that, "over 67 million women 20-24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue."</p>
<p>Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.</p>
<p>Women's ability to control their fertility is often reduced. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of <a href="/wiki/Bride_price" title="Bride price">bride price</a> signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to "confess" to the infidelity. The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. <a href="/wiki/UN_Women" title="UN Women">UN Women</a> recommended its abolition, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of <a href="/wiki/Domestic_violence" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a>, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge."</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Caste_system_in_India" title="Caste system in India">caste system in India</a> which leads to <a href="/wiki/Untouchability" title="Untouchability">untouchability</a> (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by <a href="/wiki/Dalit" title="Dalit">Dalit</a> women. In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.</p>
<p>Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Satere-Mawe" title="Satere-Mawe">Satere-Mawe</a> tribe use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bullet_ant" title="Bullet ant">bullet ants</a> as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Initiation_rite" title="Initiation rite">initiation rite</a>. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered "warriors".</p>
<p>Other harmful traditional practices include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marriage_by_abduction" title="Marriage by abduction">marriage by abduction</a>, ritualized <a href="/wiki/Sexual_slavery" title="Sexual slavery">sexual slavery</a> (<a href="/wiki/Devadasi" title="Devadasi">Devadasi</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trokosi" title="Trokosi">Trokosi</a>), <a href="/wiki/Breast_ironing" title="Breast ironing">breast ironing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Widow_inheritance" title="Widow inheritance">widow inheritance</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Exploitation_of_women_in_mass_media" title="Exploitation of women in mass media">Exploitation of women in mass media</a></div>
<p>The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as interfering with the aim of achieving gender equality by perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The <a href="/wiki/Exploitation_of_women_in_mass_media" title="Exploitation of women in mass media">exploitation of women in mass media</a> refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">mass media</a>, when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions that falsely implies that women are unimportant or invisible. Criticisms of the way women are represented in the media is that the media reinforces stereotypical societal views of "what women are for", by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects. The media emphasizes traditional roles that normalize violence against women.</p>
<p>According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to: "Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women"; "Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence"; "Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave"; "Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on"; "The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development." Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated that they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore &amp; Franko, 2002)".</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Gender_disparities_in_health" title="Gender disparities in health">Gender disparities in health</a></div>
<p>Social constructs of <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a> (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable <a href="/wiki/Masculinity" title="Masculinity">masculinity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Femininity" title="Femininity">femininity</a>) often have a negative effect on health. The WHO cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_health" title="Women's health">women's health</a>. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through <a href="/wiki/Risk" title="Risk">risk taking</a>, and men dying at much higher rate from <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> due to <a href="/wiki/Smoking" title="Smoking">smoking</a>, in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting <a href="/wiki/Men%27s_health" title="Men's health">men's health</a>. The WHO has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of <a href="/wiki/HIV/AIDS" title="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Informing_women_of_their_rights">Informing women of their rights</span></h3>
<p>While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights. This may apply to a wide range of abuses, ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems".</p>
<p>The 1993 UN <a href="/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Elimination_of_Violence_Against_Women" title="Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women">Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a> states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms". Enacting protective legislation against violence has little effect, if women do not know how to use it: for example a study of Bedouin women in Israel found that 60% did not know what a <a href="/wiki/Restraining_order" title="Restraining order">restraining order</a> was; or if they don't know what acts are illegal: a report by Amnesty International showed in Hungary, in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know that marital rape was an illegal (it was outlawed in 1997) and therefore the crime was rarely reported. Ensuring women have a minim understanding of health issues is also important: lack of access to reliable medical information and available medical procedures to which they are entitled hurts <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_health" title="Women's health">women's health</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gender_mainstreaming">Gender mainstreaming</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Gender_mainstreaming" title="Gender mainstreaming">Gender mainstreaming</a></div>
<p>Gender mainstreaming is the <a href="/wiki/Public_policy" title="Public policy">public policy</a> of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned <a href="/wiki/Policy" title="Policy">policy</a> action, including <a href="/wiki/Legislation" title="Legislation">legislation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Program_(management)" title="Program (management)">programmes</a>, in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality. The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in <a href="/wiki/Nairobi" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>. The idea has been developed in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> development community. Gender mainstreaming "involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities".</p>
<p>According to the Council of Europe definition: "Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making."</p>
<p>An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is "the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights." For example, "in Azerbaijan, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNFPA" title="UNFPA">UNFPA</a> conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders."</p>
