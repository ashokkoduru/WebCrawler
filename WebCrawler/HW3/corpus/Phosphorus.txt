<p><b>Phosphorus</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical element</a> with symbol <b>P</b> and <a href="/wiki/Atomic_number" title="Atomic number">atomic number</a> 15. As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms—<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yellow_phosphorus" title="Yellow phosphorus">white phosphorus</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_phosphorus" title="Red phosphorus">red phosphorus</a>—but because it is highly <a href="/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)" title="Reactivity (chemistry)">reactive</a>, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. At 0.099%, phosphorus is the most abundant <a href="/wiki/Pnictogen" title="Pnictogen">pnictogen</a> in the Earth's crust. With few exceptions, minerals containing phosphorus are in the maximally oxidised state as inorganic <a href="/wiki/Phosphate_minerals" title="Phosphate minerals">phosphate rocks</a>.</p>
<p>The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow when exposed to <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> – hence the name, taken from Greek mythology, <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Φωσφόρος</span> meaning "light-bearer" (Latin <i><a href="/wiki/Lucifer" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a></i>), referring to the "<a href="/wiki/Phosphorus_(morning_star)" title="Phosphorus (morning star)">Morning Star</a>", the planet <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>). The term "<a href="/wiki/Phosphorescence" title="Phosphorescence">phosphorescence</a>", meaning glow after illumination, originally derives from this property of phosphorus, although this word has since been used for a different physical process that produces a glow. The glow of phosphorus itself originates from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidation</a> of the white (but not red) phosphorus — a process now termed <a href="/wiki/Chemiluminescence" title="Chemiluminescence">chemiluminescence</a>. Together with nitrogen, arsenic, and antimony, phosphorus is classified as a <a href="/wiki/Pnictogen" title="Pnictogen">pnictogen</a>.</p>
<p>Phosphorus is essential for life. <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">Phosphates</a> (compounds containing the phosphate ion, PO<sub>4</sub>) are a component of <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="/wiki/RNA" title="RNA">RNA</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Phospholipid" title="Phospholipid">phospholipids</a>, which form all cell membranes. Demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life, elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bone_ash" title="Bone ash">bone ash</a> was an important early phosphate source. <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">Phosphate</a> mines contain fossils, especially marine fossils, because phosphate is formed from the deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems. The vast majority of phosphorus compounds produced are consumed as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertiliser" title="Fertiliser">fertilisers</a>. Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical">Physical</span></h3>

<p>Phosphorus exists as several forms (<a href="/wiki/Allotropy" title="Allotropy">allotropes</a>) that exhibit strikingly different properties. The two most common allotropes are <b>white phosphorus</b> and <b>red phosphorus</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="White_phosphorus_and_related_molecular_forms">White phosphorus and related molecular forms</span></h4>


<p>From the perspective of applications and chemical literature, the most important form of elemental phosphorus is <a href="/wiki/Allotropes_of_phosphorus#White_phosphorus" title="Allotropes of phosphorus">white phosphorus</a>, often abbreviated as <b>WP</b>. It is a soft and waxy solid which consists of tetrahedral <span class="chemf nowrap">P<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span> molecules, in which each atom is bound to the other three atoms by a single bond. This <span class="chemf nowrap">P<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span> tetrahedron is also present in liquid and gaseous phosphorus up to the temperature of 800 °C (1,470 °F) when it starts decomposing to <span class="chemf nowrap">P<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
2</span></span> molecules. White phosphorus exists in two crystalline forms: alpha (α) and beta (β). At room temperature, the alpha-form is stable, which is more common and it has cubic crystal structure and at 195.2 K (−78.0 °C), it transforms into beta-form, which has hexagonal crystal structure. These forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent P<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra.</p>
<p>White phosphorus is the least stable, the most reactive, the most <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)" title="Volatility (chemistry)">volatile</a>, the least <a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">dense</a>, and the most toxic of the allotropes. White phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus. This transformation is accelerated by light and heat, and samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow. For this reason, white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure (e.g. weapons-grade, not lab-grade WP) is also called <b>yellow phosphorus</b>. When exposed to oxygen, white phosphorus glows in the dark with a very faint tinge of green and blue. It is highly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flammable" title="Flammable">flammable</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pyrophoricity" title="Pyrophoricity">pyrophoric</a> (self-igniting) upon contact with air. Owing to its pyrophoricity, white phosphorus is used as an additive in <a href="/wiki/Napalm" title="Napalm">napalm</a>. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white "<a href="/wiki/Phosphorus_pentoxide" title="Phosphorus pentoxide">phosphorus pentoxide</a>", which consists of <span class="chemf nowrap">P<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

10</span></span> tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_Decomposition" title="Thermal Decomposition">Thermolysis</a> (cracking) of P<sub>4</sub> at 1100 kelvin gives <a href="/wiki/Diphosphorus" title="Diphosphorus">diphosphorus</a>, P<sub>2</sub>. This species is not stable as a solid or liquid. The dimeric unit contains a triple bond and is analogous to N<sub>2</sub>. It can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents. At still higher temperatures, P<sub>2</sub> dissociates into atomic P.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Red_phosphorus">Red phosphorus</span></h4>


<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_phosphorus" title="Red phosphorus">Red phosphorus</a> is polymeric in structure. It can be viewed as a derivative of P<sub>4</sub> wherein one P-P bond is broken, and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron resulting in a chain-like structure. Red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to 250 °C (482 °F) or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight. Phosphorus after this treatment is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amorphous" title="Amorphous">amorphous</a>. Upon further heating, this material crystallises. In this sense, red phosphorus is not an allotrope, but rather an intermediate phase between the white and violet phosphorus, and most of its properties have a range of values. For example, freshly prepared, bright red phosphorus is highly reactive and ignites at about 300 °C (572 °F), though it is more stable than white phosphorus, which ignites at about 30 °C (86 °F). After prolonged heating or storage, the color darkens (see infobox images); the resulting product is more stable and does not spontaneously ignite in air.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Violet_phosphorus">Violet phosphorus</span></h4>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Violet_phosphorus" title="Violet phosphorus">Violet phosphorus</a> is a form of phosphorus that can be produced by day-long annealing of red phosphorus above 550 °C. In 1865, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hittorf" title="Hittorf">Hittorf</a> discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallised from molten <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>, a red/purple form is obtained. Therefore, this form is sometimes known as "Hittorf's phosphorus" (or violet or α-metallic phosphorus).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Black_phosphorus">Black phosphorus</span></h4>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_phosphorus" title="Black phosphorus">Black phosphorus</a> is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below 550 °C (1,022 °F). It is also known as β-metallic phosphorus and has a structure somewhat resembling that of <a href="/wiki/Graphite" title="Graphite">graphite</a>.</p>
<p>Black phosphorus is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures (about 12,000 standard atmospheres or 1.2 gigapascals) or in the presence of mercury. In appearance, properties, and structure, it resembles <a href="/wiki/Graphite" title="Graphite">graphite</a>, being black and flaky, a conductor of electricity, and has puckered sheets of linked atoms.</p>
<p>High pressures are usually required to produce black phosphorus, but it can also be produced at ambient conditions using metal salts as catalysts.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_forms">Other forms</span></h4>
<p>Another form, scarlet phosphorus, is obtained by allowing a solution of white phosphorus in <a href="/wiki/Carbon_disulfide" title="Carbon disulfide">carbon disulfide</a> to evaporate in <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>.</p>
<p>Another allotrope is <a href="/wiki/Diphosphorus" title="Diphosphorus">diphosphorus</a>; it contains a phosphorus <a href="/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry)" title="Dimer (chemistry)">dimer</a> as a structural unit and is highly reactive.</p>

<p>Two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactive_isotope" title="Radioactive isotope">radioactive isotopes</a> of phosphorus have half lives suitable for biological scientific experiments. These are:</p>

<p>At 0.099%, phosphorus is the most abundant <a href="/wiki/Pnictogen" title="Pnictogen">pnictogen</a> in the Earth's crust but it is not found free in nature, but it is widely distributed in many <a href="/wiki/Mineral" title="Mineral">minerals</a>, mainly phosphates. Inorganic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phosphate_rock" title="Phosphate rock">phosphate rock</a>, which is partially made of <a href="/wiki/Apatite" title="Apatite">apatite</a> (an impure tri-<a href="/wiki/Calcium_phosphate" title="Calcium phosphate">calcium phosphate</a> mineral), is today the chief commercial source of this element. According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_Geological_Survey" title="US Geological Survey">US Geological Survey (USGS)</a>, about 50 percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in the Arab nations. Large deposits of apatite are located in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="/wiki/Idaho" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, and elsewhere. <a href="/wiki/Albright_and_Wilson" title="Albright and Wilson">Albright and Wilson</a> in the UK and their <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Falls" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a> plant, for instance, were using phosphate rock in the 1890s and 1900s from Tennessee, Florida, and the <a href="/wiki/%C3%8Eles_du_Conn%C3%A9table" title="Îles du Connétable">Îles du Connétable</a> (<a href="/wiki/Guano" title="Guano">guano</a> island sources of phosphate); by 1950 they were using phosphate rock mainly from Tennessee and North Africa. In the early 1990s Albright and Wilson's purified wet phosphoric acid business was being adversely affected by phosphate rock sales by China and the entry of their long-standing Moroccan phosphate suppliers into the purified wet phosphoric acid business.</p>

<p>In 2012, the USGS estimated 71 billion tons of world reserves, where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices; 0.19 billion tons were mined in 2011. Critical to contemporary agriculture, its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population.</p>
<p>Recent reports suggest that production of phosphorus may have peaked, leading to the possibility of global shortages by 2040. In 2007, at the rate of consumption, the supply of phosphorus was estimated to run out in 345 years. However, some scientists now believe that a "<a href="/wiki/Peak_phosphorus" title="Peak phosphorus">peak phosphorus</a>" will occur in 30 years and that "At current rates, reserves will be depleted in the next 50 to 100 years." Cofounder of <a href="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a>-based investment firm and environmental foundation <a href="/wiki/Grantham" title="Grantham">Jeremy Grantham</a> wrote in <a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)"><i>Nature</i></a> in November 2012, that consumption of the element "must be drastically reduced in the next 20-40 years or we will begin to starve." According to N.N. Greenwood and A. Earnshaw, authors of the textbook, <i>Chemistry of the Elements,</i> however, phosphorus comprises about 0.1% by mass of the average rock, and consequently the Earth's supply is vast, although dilute.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Reuse_of_excreta" title="Reuse of excreta">Reuse of excreta</a></div>
<p>Urine contains most (94% according to Wolgast) of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NPK" title="NPK">NPK</a> nutrients excreted by the human body. The more general limitations to using urine as fertiliser depend mainly on the potential for buildup of excess nitrogen (due to the high ratio of that macronutrient), and inorganic <a href="/wiki/Salt" title="Salt">salts</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">sodium chloride</a>, which are also part of the wastes excreted by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renal_system" title="Renal system">renal system</a>. The degree to which these factors impact the effectiveness depends on the term of use, salinity tolerance of the plant, soil composition, addition of other fertilising compounds, and quantity of rainfall or other irrigation.</p>
<p>Urine typically contributes 70% of the <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and more than half the phosphorus and <a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a> found in urban waste water flows, while making up less than 1% of the overall volume.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Phosphoric_acid" title="Phosphoric acid">Phosphoric acid</a></div>
<p>Most production of phosphorus-bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers. For this purpose, phosphate minerals are converted to phosphoric acid. It follows two distinct chemical routes, the main one being treatment of phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid. The other process utilises white phosphorus, which may be produced by reaction and distillation from very low grade phosphate sources. The white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with base to give phosphate salts. Phosphoric acid produced from white phosphorus is relatively pure and is the main route for the production of phosphates for all purposes, including detergent production.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_phosphorus">Elemental phosphorus</span></h3>
<p>Presently, about 1,000,000 <a href="/wiki/Short_ton" title="Short ton">short tons</a> (910,000 <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">t</a>) of elemental phosphorus is produced annually. Calcium phosphate (phosphate rock), mostly mined in Florida and North Africa, can be heated to 1,200–1,500 °C with sand, which is mostly <span class="chemf nowrap">SiO<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

4</span></span>. The product is subsequently condensed into a white powder under water to prevent oxidation by air. Even under water, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/White_phosphorus" title="White phosphorus">white phosphorus</a> is slowly converted to the more stable red phosphorus <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Allotrope" title="Allotrope">allotrope</a>. The chemical equation for this process when starting with fluoroapatite, a common phosphate mineral, is:</p>

<p>Side products from this process include ferrophosphorus, a crude form of Fe<sub>2</sub>P, resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors. The silicate <a href="/wiki/Slag" title="Slag">slag</a> is a useful construction material. The fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in <a href="/wiki/Water_fluoridation" title="Water fluoridation">water fluoridation</a>. More problematic is a "mud" containing significant amounts of white phosphorus. Production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive. The white phosphorus is transported in molten form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation; train derailments at <a href="/wiki/Brownstone" title="Brownstone">Brownston, Nebraska</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miamisburg,_Ohio" title="Miamisburg, Ohio">Miamisburg, Ohio</a> led to large fires. The worst incident in recent times was an environmental contamination in 1968 when the sea was polluted from spillage and/or inadequately treated sewage from a white phosphorus plant at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Placentia_Bay,_Newfoundland" title="Placentia Bay, Newfoundland">Placentia Bay, Newfoundland</a>.</p>
<p>Another process by which elemental phosphorus is extracted includes applying at high temperatures (1500 °C):</p>

<p>Historically, before the development of mineral-based extractions, white phosphorus was isolated on an industrial scale from bone ash. In this process, the <a href="/wiki/Tricalcium_phosphate" title="Tricalcium phosphate">tricalcium phosphate</a> in bone ash is converted to <a href="/wiki/Monocalcium_phosphate" title="Monocalcium phosphate">monocalcium phosphate</a> with <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Monocalcium_phosphate" title="Monocalcium phosphate">Monocalcium phosphate</a> is then dehydrated to the corresponding metaphosphate:</p>

<p>When ignited to a white heat with <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, calcium metaphosphate yields two-thirds of its weight of white phosphorus while one-third of the phosphorus remains in the residue as calcium orthophosphate:</p>

<p>Phosphorous oxoacids are extensive, often commercially important, and sometimes structurally complicated.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spelling_and_etymology">Spelling and etymology</span></h2>
<p>The name <i>Phosphorus</i> in Ancient Greece was the name for the planet <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> and is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> words (φῶς = light, φέρω = carry), which roughly translates as light-bringer or light carrier. (In <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a> and tradition, Augerinus (Αυγερινός = morning star, still in use today), Hesperus or Hesperinus (΄Εσπερος or Εσπερινός or Αποσπερίτης = evening star, still in use today) and Eosphorus (Εωσφόρος = dawnbearer, not in use for the planet after Christianity) are close homologues, and also associated with Phosphorus-the-planet).</p>
<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the correct spelling of the element is <b>phosphorus</b>. The word <b>phosphorous</b> is the adjectival form of the P valence: so, just as <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> forms sulfur<b>ous</b> and sulfur<b>ic</b> compounds, phosphor<b>us</b> forms phosphor<b>ous</b> compounds (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Phosphorous_acid" title="Phosphorous acid">phosphorous acid</a>) and P valence phosphor<b>ic</b> compounds (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Phosphoric_acids_and_phosphates" title="Phosphoric acids and phosphates">phosphoric acids and phosphates</a>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_and_discovery">History and discovery</span></h2>
<p>Phosphorus was the 13th element to be discovered. For this reason, and also due to its use in explosives, poisons and nerve agents, it is sometimes referred to as "the Devil's element". It was the first element to be discovered that was not known since ancient times. The discovery of phosphorus is credited to the German alchemist <a href="/wiki/Hennig_Brand" title="Hennig Brand">Hennig Brand</a> in 1669, although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time. Brand experimented with <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a>, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. Working in <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, Brand attempted to create the fabled <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone" title="Philosopher's stone">philosopher's stone</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a> of some <a href="/wiki/Salt" title="Salt">salts</a> by evaporating urine, and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. It was named <i>phosphorus mirabilis</i> ("miraculous bearer of light"). His process originally involved letting urine stand for days until it gave off a terrible smell. Then he boiled it down to a paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, <span class="chemf nowrap">(NH<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

4</span></span>. While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about 1,100 litres [290 US gal] of urine to make about 60 g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.</p>

<p>Brand at first tried to keep the method secret, but later sold the recipe for 200 thalers to D Krafft from Dresden, who could now make it as well, and toured much of Europe with it, including England, where he met with <a href="/wiki/Robert_Boyle" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>. The secret that it was made from urine leaked out and first <a href="/wiki/Johann_von_L%C3%B6wenstern-Kunckel" title="Johann von Löwenstern-Kunckel">Johann Kunckel</a> (1630–1703) in Sweden (1678) and later Boyle in London (1680) also managed to make phosphorus, possibly with the aid of his assistant, <a href="/wiki/Ambrose_Godfrey" title="Ambrose Godfrey">Ambrose Godfrey-Hanckwitz</a>, who later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus. Boyle states that Krafft gave him no information as to the preparation of phosphorus other than that it was derived from "somewhat that belonged to the body of man". This gave Boyle a valuable clue, so that he, too, managed to make phosphorus, and published the method of its manufacture. Later he improved Brand's process by using sand in the reaction (still using urine as base material),</p>

<p>Robert Boyle was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur-tipped wooden splints, forerunners of our modern matches, in 1680.</p>

Bone ash was the major source of phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Retorts" title="Retorts">retorts</a> encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a> in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a <a href="/wiki/Retort" title="Retort">retort</a>. <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">Carbon monoxide</a> and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack.</p>
<p>In the 1840s, world phosphate production turned to the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat <a href="/wiki/Guano" title="Guano">guano</a> (see also <a href="/wiki/Guano_Islands_Act" title="Guano Islands Act">Guano Islands Act</a>). These became an important source of phosphates for fertiliser in the latter half of the 19th century.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phosphate_rock" title="Phosphate rock">Phosphate rock</a>, a mineral containing calcium phosphate, was first used in 1850 to make phosphorus, and following the introduction of the electric arc furnace in 1890, elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone-ash heating, to electric arc production from phosphate rock. After the depletion of world guano sources about the same time, mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production. Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II, and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today. See the article on <a href="/wiki/Peak_phosphorus" title="Peak phosphorus">peak phosphorus</a> for more information on the history and present state of phosphate mining. Phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertiliser industry, where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superphosphate" title="Superphosphate">superphosphate</a>" fertiliser products.</p>
<p>White phosphorus was first made commercially in the 19th century for the <a href="/wiki/Match" title="Match">match</a> industry. This used bone ash for a phosphate source, as described above. The bone-ash process became obsolete when the <a href="/wiki/Submerged-arc_furnace_for_phosphorus_production" title="Submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production">submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production</a> was introduced to reduce phosphate rock. The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war. In <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> it was used in incendiaries, <a href="/wiki/Smoke_screen" title="Smoke screen">smoke screens</a> and tracer bullets. A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>-filled <a href="/wiki/Zeppelin" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelins</a> over Britain (hydrogen being highly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flammable" title="Flammable">flammable</a>). During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molotov_cocktail" title="Molotov cocktail">Molotov cocktails</a> made of phosphorus dissolved in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Petrol" title="Petrol">petrol</a> were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale. Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects.</p>
<p>Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition, which was dangerous due to its toxicity. Murders, suicides and accidental <a href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">poisonings</a> resulted from its use. (An apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food, which was detected by the stew's giving off luminous steam). In addition, exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe <a href="/wiki/Necrosis" title="Necrosis">necrosis</a> of the bones of the jaw, the infamous "<a href="/wiki/Phossy_jaw" title="Phossy jaw">phossy jaw</a>". When a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered, with its far lower flammability and toxicity, laws were enacted, under the <a href="/wiki/Berne_Convention_(1906)" title="Berne Convention (1906)">Berne Convention (1906)</a>, requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture. The toxicity of white phosphorus led to discontinuation of its use in matches. The Allies used phosphorus <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incendiary_bomb" title="Incendiary bomb">incendiary bombs</a> in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> to destroy Hamburg, the place where the "miraculous bearer of light" was first discovered.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Glow">Glow</span></h3>
<p>It was known from early times that the green glow emanating from white phosphorus would persist for a time in a stoppered jar, but then cease. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Boyle" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> in the 1680s ascribed it to "debilitation" of the air; in fact, it is oxygen being consumed. By the 18th century, it was known that in pure oxygen, phosphorus does not glow at all; there is only a range of <a href="/wiki/Partial_pressure" title="Partial pressure">partial pressure</a> at which it does. Heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures.</p>
<p>In 1974, the glow was explained by R. J. van Zee and A. U. Khan. A reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid (or liquid) phosphorus, forming the short-lived molecules HPO and <span class="chemf nowrap">P<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

2</span></span> that both emit visible light. The reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence, hence the extended time the glow continues in a stoppered jar.</p>
<p>Since that time, <i><a href="/wiki/Phosphor" title="Phosphor">phosphors</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Phosphorescence" title="Phosphorescence">phosphorescence</a></i> were used loosely to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning.

<p>Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate <span class="chemf nowrap">PO<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left">3−<br/>
4</span></span> is required for all known forms of <a href="/wiki/Life" title="Life">life</a>. Phosphorus plays a major role in the structural framework of <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="/wiki/RNA" title="RNA">RNA</a>. Living cells use phosphate to transport cellular energy with <a href="/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP), necessary for every cellular process that uses energy. ATP is also important for <a href="/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a>, a key regulatory event in cells. <a href="/wiki/Phospholipid" title="Phospholipid">Phospholipids</a> are the main structural components of all cellular membranes. <a href="/wiki/Calcium_phosphate" title="Calcium phosphate">Calcium phosphate</a> salts assist in stiffening <a href="/wiki/Bone" title="Bone">bones</a>.</p>
<p>Every living cell is encased in a membrane that separates it from its surroundings. Cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins, typically in the form of a bilayer. Phospholipids are derived from <a href="/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a> with two of the glycerol hydroxyl (OH) protons replaced by fatty acids as an <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">ester</a>, and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol.</p>
<p>An average adult human contains about 0.7 kg of phosphorus, about 85–90% in bones and teeth in the form of <a href="/wiki/Apatite" title="Apatite">apatite</a>, and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids (~1%). The phosphorus content increases from about 0.5 weight% in infancy to 0.65–1.1 weight% in adults. Average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about 0.4 g/L, about 70% of that is organic and 30% inorganic phosphates. A well-fed adult in the industrialized world consumes and excretes about 1–3 grams of phosphorus per day, with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus-containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids; and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as <span class="chemf nowrap">H<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>

4</span></span>. Only about 0.1% of body phosphate circulates in the blood, paralleling the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bone_and_teeth_enamel">Bone and teeth enamel</span></h3>
<p>The main component of bone is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroxyapatite" title="Hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate, possibly including carbonate. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel. <a href="/wiki/Water_fluoridation" title="Water fluoridation">Water fluoridation</a> enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material called fluoroapatite:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Phosphorus_deficiency">Phosphorus deficiency</span></h3>
<p>In medicine, phosphate deficiency syndrome may be caused by malnutrition, by failure to absorb phosphate, and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood (such as re-feeding after malnutrition) or pass too much of it into the urine. All are characterised by <a href="/wiki/Hypophosphatemia" title="Hypophosphatemia">hypophosphatemia</a>, which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP. Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body's ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.</p>
<p>Phosphorus is an essential <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macromineral" title="Macromineral">macromineral</a> for plants, which is studied extensively in <a href="/wiki/Edaphology" title="Edaphology">edaphology</a> to understand plant uptake from <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> systems. Phosphorus is a <a href="/wiki/Limiting_factor" title="Limiting factor">limiting factor</a> in many <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>; that is, the scarcity of phosphorus limits the rate of organism growth. An excess of phosphorus can also be problematic, especially in aquatic systems where <a href="/wiki/Eutrophication" title="Eutrophication">eutrophication</a> sometimes leads to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Algal_blooms" title="Algal blooms">algal blooms</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_sources">Food sources</span></h3>
<p>The main food sources for phosphorus are the same as those containing protein, although proteins do not contain phosphorus. For example, milk, meat, and soya typically also have phosphorus. As a rule, if a diet has sufficient protein and calcium, the amount of phosphorus is probably sufficient.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Precautions">Precautions</span></h2>
<p>Organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials; many are required for life, but some are extremely toxic. Fluorophosphate <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">esters</a> are among the most potent <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" title="Neurotoxin">neurotoxins</a> known. A wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pesticides" title="Pesticides">pesticides</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Herbicides" title="Herbicides">herbicides</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Insecticides" title="Insecticides">insecticides</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungicides" title="Fungicides">fungicides</a>, etc.) and <a href="/wiki/Weapon" title="Weapon">weaponised</a> as nerve agents against enemy humans. Most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients.</p>
<p>The white phosphorus allotrope presents a significant hazard because it ignites in air and produces phosphoric acid residue. Chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called "<a href="/wiki/Phossy_jaw" title="Phossy jaw">phossy jaw</a>". White phosphorus is <a href="/wiki/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxic</a>, causing severe liver damage on ingestion and may cause a condition known as "Smoking Stool Syndrome".</p>

<p>In the past, external exposure to elemental phosphorus was treated by washing the affected area with 2% <a href="/wiki/Copper_sulfate" title="Copper sulfate">copper sulfate</a> solution to form harmless compounds that are then washed away. According to the recent <i>US Navy's Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries: FM8-285: Part 2 Conventional Military Chemical Injuries</i>, "Cupric (copper(II)) sulfate has been used by U.S. personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations. However, copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued. Copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis."</p>
<p>The manual suggests instead "<i>a bicarbonate solution to neutralise phosphoric acid, which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus. Particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them, or by their phosphorescence in the dark. In dark surroundings, fragments are seen as luminescent spots. Promptly <a href="/wiki/Debridement" title="Debridement">debride</a> the burn if the patient's condition will permit removal of bits of WP (white phosphorus) that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning. DO NOT apply oily-based <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Topical#Ointment" title="Topical">ointments</a> until it is certain that all WP has been removed. Following complete removal of the particles, treat the lesions as thermal burns.</i>" As white phosphorus readily mixes with oils, any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed.</p>
<p>People can be exposed to phosphorus in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) has set the phosphorus exposure limit (<a href="/wiki/Permissible_exposure_limit" title="Permissible exposure limit">Permissible exposure limit</a>) in the workplace at 0.1 mg/m over an 8-hour workday. The <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health" title="National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="/wiki/Recommended_exposure_limit" title="Recommended exposure limit">Recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) of 0.1 mg/m over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 5 mg/m, phosphorus is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IDLH" title="IDLH">immediately dangerous to life and health</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="US_DEA_List_I_status">US DEA List I status</span></h3>
<p>Phosphorus can reduce elemental <a href="/wiki/Iodine" title="Iodine">iodine</a> to <a href="/wiki/Hydroiodic_acid" title="Hydroiodic acid">hydroiodic acid</a>, which is a reagent effective for reducing <a href="/wiki/Ephedrine" title="Ephedrine">ephedrine</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pseudoephedrine" title="Pseudoephedrine">pseudoephedrine</a> to methamphetamine. For this reason, red and white phosphorus were designated by the United States <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> as <a href="/wiki/DEA_list_of_chemicals" title="DEA list of chemicals">List I precursor chemicals</a> under <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations" title="Code of Federal Regulations">21 CFR 1310.02</a> effective on November 17, 2001. In the United States, handlers of red or white phosphorus are subject to stringent regulatory controls.</p>
