The university can trace its origins to a School of Medicine and Surgery (later the College of Medicine), established in 1834, and to the <a href="/wiki/Edward_Fenwick_Boyd#College_of_Physical_Science" title="Edward Fenwick Boyd">College of Physical Science</a> (later renamed Armstrong College), founded in 1871. These two colleges came to form one division of the federal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Durham" title="University of Durham">University of Durham</a>, with the Durham Colleges forming the other. The Newcastle colleges merged to form King's College in 1937. In 1963, following an Act of Parliament, King's College became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>
<p>Newcastle University is a <a href="/wiki/Red_brick_university" title="Red brick university">red brick university</a> and is a member of the <a href="/wiki/Russell_Group" title="Russell Group">Russell Group</a>, an association of prestigious research-intensive UK universities. The university has one of the largest EU research portfolios in the UK. Newcastle attracts over 20,000 students from more than 120 different countries.</p>
<p>Teaching and research are delivered in 24 academic schools and 40 research institutes and research centres, spread across three Faculties: the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences; the Faculty of Medical Sciences; and the Faculty of Science, Agriculture and Engineering.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The university has its origins in the School of Medicine and Surgery, which was established in <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in October 1834, when it provided basic lectures and practical demonstrations to around 26 students. In June 1851, following a dispute among the teaching staff, the School split into two rival institutions. The majority formed the Newcastle College of Medicine, and the others established themselves as the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Practical Science. By 1852, the majority college was formally linked to the <a href="/wiki/Durham_University" title="Durham University">University of Durham</a>. It awarded its first 'Licence in Medicine' (Lic.Med) in 1856, and its teaching certificates were recognised by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_London" title="University of London">University of London</a> for graduation in medicine. The two colleges amalgamated in 1857 and renamed the <i>University of Durham College of Medicine</i> in 1870.</p>
<p>Attempts to realise a place for the teaching of sciences in the city were finally met with the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Edward_Fenwick_Boyd#College_of_Physical_Science" title="Edward Fenwick Boyd">College of Physical Science</a> in 1871. The college offered instruction in mathematics, physics, chemistry and geology to meet the growing needs of the mining industry, becoming the <i>Durham College of Physical Science</i> in 1883 and then renamed after <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_George_Armstrong,_1st_Baron_Armstrong" title="William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong">William George Armstrong</a> as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defunct_colleges_of_Durham_University" title="Defunct colleges of Durham University">Armstrong College</a> in 1904. Both these separate and independent institutions later became part of the University of Durham, whose 1908 Act formally recognised that the university consisted of two Divisions, Durham and Newcastle, on two different sites. By 1908, the Newcastle Division was teaching a full range of subjects in the Faculties of Medicine, Arts, and Science, which also included agriculture and engineering.</p>
<p>Throughout the early 20th century, the medical and science colleges vastly outpaced the growth of their Durham counterparts and a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Commission" title="Royal Commission">Royal Commission</a> in 1934 recommended the merger of the two colleges to form King's College, Durham. Growth of the Newcastle Division of the federal Durham University led to tensions within the structure and on 1 August 1963 an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> separated the two, creating the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coat_of_arms">Coat of arms</span></h3>
<p>As the successor of King's College, Durham, the university at its founding in 1963, adopted the coat of arms originally granted to the Council of King's College in 1937. In the Letters Patent authorising the transfer, the arms are blazoned <i>Azure, a Cross of St Cuthbert Argent and in chief of the last a lion passant guardant Gules</i> (On a blue shield, a silver square cross with flared ends, and on the top third of the shield, which is silver, a red lion walking and looking towards the viewer). There is no motto.</p>
<p>Above the portico of the Students' Union building are bas-relief carvings of the arms and mottoes of the University of Durham, Armstrong College and Durham University College of Medicine, the predecessor parts of Newcastle University.</p>

<p>The university occupies a campus site close to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Newcastle_Haymarket" title="Newcastle Haymarket">Haymarket</a> in central Newcastle upon Tyne. It is located to the northwest of the city centre between the open spaces of <a href="/wiki/Leazes_Park" title="Leazes Park">Leazes Park</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Town_Moor,_Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Town Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne">Town Moor</a>.</p>
<p>The Armstrong building is the oldest building on the campus and is the site of the original Armstrong College. The building was constructed in three stages; the north east wing was completed first at a cost of <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">Â£</a>18,000 and opened by <a href="/wiki/Princess_Louise,_Duchess_of_Argyll" title="Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll">HRH Princess Louise</a> on 5 November 1888. The south-east wing, which includes the Jubilee Tower, and south-west wings were opened in 1894. The Jubilee Tower was built with surplus funds raised from an Exhibition to mark <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Golden_Jubilee" title="Golden Jubilee">Jubilee</a> in 1887. The north-west front, forming the main entrance, was completed in 1906 and features two stone figures to represent science and the arts. Much of the later construction work was financed by Sir Isaac <a href="/wiki/Lowthian_Bell" title="Lowthian Bell">Lowthian Bell</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Metallurgy" title="Metallurgy">metallurgist</a> and former <a href="/wiki/Lord_Mayor" title="Lord Mayor">Lord Mayor</a> of Newcastle, after whom the main tower is named. In 1906 it was opened by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/King_Edward_VII" title="King Edward VII">King Edward VII</a>.</p>
<p>The building contains the <i>King's Hall</i>, which serves as the university's chief hall for ceremonial purposes where <a href="/wiki/Graduation" title="Graduation">Congregation</a> ceremonies are held. It can contain 500 seats. King Edward VII gave permission to call the Great Hall, King's Hall. Graduation photographs are often taken in the University Quadrangle, next to the Armstrong building. In 1949 the Quadrangle was turned into a formal garden in memory of members of Newcastle University who gave their lives in the two World Wars.</p>
<p>The Bruce Building is a former brewery, constructed between 1896 and 1900 on the site of the Hotspur Hotel, and designed by the architect <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Oswald" title="Joseph Oswald">Joseph Oswald</a> as the new premises of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Newcastle_Breweries" title="Newcastle Breweries">Newcastle Breweries</a> Limited. As of 2014 the building had been empty for some time and the university had sold it on a long lease with the intention that it would be converted into student accommodation and commercial/office space. According to a spokesman for the university "It was not flexible enough for academic use. The proposed use is complementary to the university."</p>
