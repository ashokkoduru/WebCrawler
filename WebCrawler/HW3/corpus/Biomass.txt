<p><b>Biomass</b> is <a href="/wiki/Organic_matter" title="Organic matter">organic matter</a> derived from living, or recently living organisms. Biomass can be used as a source of energy and it most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called <a href="/wiki/Lignocellulosic_biomass" title="Lignocellulosic biomass">lignocellulosic biomass</a>. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: <i>thermal</i>, <i>chemical</i>, and <i>biochemical</i> methods.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biomass_sources">Biomass sources</span></h2>

<p>Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire. Even today, biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries. Biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams (104.9 * 10 g – about 105 billion metric tons) of carbon per year, about half in the ocean and half on land.</p>
<p>Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues (such as dead trees, branches and <a href="/wiki/Tree_stump" title="Tree stump">tree stumps</a>), yard clippings, wood chips and even <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a>. Wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass (second-generation biofuels) as fuel. Harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into <a href="/wiki/Pellet_fuel" title="Pellet fuel">pellet fuel</a> or other forms of fuels. The largest source of energy from wood is pulping liquor or "<a href="/wiki/Black_liquor" title="Black liquor">black liquor</a>," a waste product from processes of the pulp, paper and paperboard industry. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial <a href="/wiki/Chemical_industry" title="Chemical industry">chemicals</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a>. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including <a href="/wiki/Miscanthus" title="Miscanthus">miscanthus</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Switchgrass" title="Switchgrass">switchgrass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Populus" title="Populus">poplar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bamboo" title="Bamboo">bamboo</a>, and a variety of <a href="/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">tree</a> species, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Eucalyptus" title="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_palm" title="Oil palm">oil palm</a> (<a href="/wiki/Palm_oil" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>).</p>
<p>Based on the source of biomass, biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories. <a href="/wiki/Biofuel#First-generation_biofuels" title="Biofuel">First-generation biofuels</a> are derived from sources such as sugarcane and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corn" title="Corn">corn</a> starch. Sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioethanol" title="Bioethanol">bioethanol</a>, an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a <a href="/wiki/Fuel_cell" title="Fuel cell">fuel cell</a> to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline. However, utilizing food-based resources for fuel production only aggravates the food shortage problem. <a href="/wiki/Second-generation_biofuels" title="Second-generation biofuels">Second-generation biofuels</a>, on the other hand, utilize non-food-based biomass sources such as agriculture and municipal waste. These biofuels mostly consist of <a href="/wiki/Lignocellulosic_biomass" title="Lignocellulosic biomass">lignocellulosic biomass</a>, which is not edible and is a low-value waste for many industries. Despite being the favored alternative, economical production of second-generation biofuel is not yet achieved due to technological issues. These issues arise mainly due to chemical inertness and structural rigidity of <a href="/wiki/Lignocellulosic_biomass" title="Lignocellulosic biomass">lignocellulosic biomass</a>.</p>
<p>Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectare</a> with low input energy. Some examples of these plants are wheat, which typically yields 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare, and straw, which typically yields 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the UK. The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a> to <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.</p>
<p>The main contributors of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waste_energy" title="Waste energy">waste energy</a> are <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Manufacturing_waste" title="Manufacturing waste">manufacturing waste</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a>. Energy derived from biomass is projected to be the largest non-hydroelectric renewable resource of electricity in the US between 2000 and 2020.</p>
<p>Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas, also called <a href="/wiki/Landfill_gas" title="Landfill gas">landfill gas</a> or <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a>. Crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Several biodiesel companies simply collect used restaurant cooking oil and convert it into biodiesel. Also, biomass-to-liquids (called "BTLs") and cellulosic ethanol are still under research.</p>
<p>There is research involving algae, or algae-derived, biomass, as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Butanol" title="Butanol">butanol</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Biodiesel" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production. Genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel.</p>
<p>The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">US</a>. Agricultural waste is common in <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> (sugar cane residue) and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as <a href="/wiki/Poultry_litter" title="Poultry litter">poultry litter</a>, are common in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UK" title="UK">UK</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2015, a new <a href="/wiki/Sewage_waste_energy" title="Sewage waste energy">bioenergy sewage treatment</a> process aimed at developing countries is under trial; the <a href="/wiki/Omni_Processor" title="Omni Processor">Omni Processor</a> is a self-sustaining process which uses sewerage solids as fuel in a process to convert waste water into drinking water, with surplus electrical energy being generated for export.</p>

For reference, the total solar power on Earth is 174 kTW. The biomass equivalent to solar energy ratio is 143 ppm (parts per million), given current living system coverage on Earth. Best in class solar cell efficiency is (20–40)%. Additionally, Earth's internal radioactive energy production, largely the driver for volcanic activity, continental drift, etc., is in the same range of power, 20 TW. At some 50% carbon mass content in biomass, annual production, this corresponds to about 6% of atmospheric carbon content in CO2 (for the current 400 ppm).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermal_conversion">Thermal conversion</span></h3>


<p>Thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form. Also known as thermal oil heating, it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system. The basic alternatives of <a href="/wiki/Combustion" title="Combustion">combustion</a> (<a href="/wiki/Torrefaction" title="Torrefaction">torrefaction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pyrolysis" title="Pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gasification" title="Gasification">gasification</a>) are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed (mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature).</p>
<p>Energy created by burning biomass (fuel wood) is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly, e.g. tropical countries. There are a number of other less common, more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading (HTU) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroprocessing" title="Hydroprocessing">hydroprocessing</a>. Some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass, including aqueous slurries, and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms. Some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power (CHP) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Co-firing" title="Co-firing">co-firing</a>. In a typical dedicated biomass power plant, efficiencies range from 20–27% (<a href="/wiki/Heat_of_combustion#Higher_heating_value" title="Heat of combustion">higher heating value</a> basis). Biomass cofiring with coal, by contrast, typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30–40%, higher heating value basis).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_conversion">Chemical conversion</span></h3>
<p>A range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms, such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used, transported or stored, or to exploit some property of the process itself. Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch_synthesis" title="Fischer-Tropsch synthesis">Fischer-Tropsch synthesis</a>, methanol production, olefins (ethylene and propylene), and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks. In most cases, the first step involves gasification, which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk. Biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid. Therefore, biomass <a href="/wiki/Gasification" title="Gasification">gasification</a> is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, and traces of <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. This gas mixture, called a <a href="/wiki/Producer_gas#USA" title="Producer gas">producer gas</a>, can provide fuel for various vital processes, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engines" title="Internal combustion engines">internal combustion engines</a>, as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications. Because any biomass material can undergo gasification, this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production, where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel. In addition, biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste (such as wastes available on a farm) into producer gas, which is a very usable fuel.</p>
<p>Conversion of biomass to <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a> can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass. For example, <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a> can be converted to intermediate platform chemical such a <a href="/wiki/Sorbitol" title="Sorbitol">sorbitol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydroxymethylfurfural" title="Hydroxymethylfurfural">hydroxymethylfurfural</a> etc. These chemical are then further reacted to produce hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels.</p>
<p>Biomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Halomethanes" title="Halomethanes">Halomethanes</a> have successfully been by produced using a combination of A. fermentans and engineered S. cerevisiae. This method converts NaX salts and unprocessed biomass such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Switchgrass" title="Switchgrass">switchgrass</a>, sugarcane, corn stover, or <a href="/wiki/Populus" title="Populus">poplar</a> into halomethanes. S-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in S. cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred. Production levels of 150 mg L-1H-1 iodomethane were achieved. At these levels roughly 173000L of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the United States’ need for iodomethane. However, an advantage of this method is that it uses NaI rather than I2; NaI is significantly less hazardous than I2. This method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biochemical_conversion">Biochemical conversion</span></h3>
<p>As biomass is a natural material, many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed, and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed.</p>
<p>Biochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels, such a biogas or bioethanol. In most cases, microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process: <a href="/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion" title="Anaerobic digestion">anaerobic digestion</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)" title="Fermentation (biochemistry)">fermentation</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Composting" title="Composting">composting</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electrochemical_conversion">Electrochemical conversion</span></h3>
<p>In addition to combustion, biomass/biofuels can be directly converted to electrical energy via electrochemical oxidation of the material. This can be performed directly in a <a href="/wiki/Direct_carbon_fuel_cell" title="Direct carbon fuel cell">direct carbon fuel cell</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Direct_ethanol_fuel_cell" title="Direct ethanol fuel cell">direct ethanol fuel cell</a> or a microbial fuel cell. The fuel can also be consumed indirectly via a <a href="/wiki/Fuel_cell" title="Fuel cell">fuel cell</a> system containing a reformer which converts the biomass into a mixture of CO and H2 before it is consumed in the fuel cell.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_the_United_States">In the United States</span></h3>
<p>The biomass power generating industry in the United States, which consists of approximately 11,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a> of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid, produces about 1.4 percent of the U.S. electricity supply.</p>
<p>Currently, the New Hope Power Partnership is the largest biomass power plant in the U.S. The 140 MW facility uses sugarcane fiber (<a href="/wiki/Bagasse" title="Bagasse">bagasse</a>) and recycled urban wood as fuel to generate enough power for its large milling and refining operations as well as to supply electricity for nearly 60,000 homes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second-generation_biofuels">Second-generation biofuels</span></h3>
<p>Second-generation biofuels were not (in 2010) produced commercially, but a considerable number of research activities were taking place mainly in North America, Europe and also in some emerging countries. These tend to use feedstock produced by rapidly reproducing <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> from various sources including <a href="/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">excrement</a> grown in <a href="/wiki/Cell_culture" title="Cell culture">Cell cultures</a> or <a href="/wiki/Hydroponics" title="Hydroponics">hydroponics</a> There is huge potential for second generation biofuels but non-edible feedstock resources are highly under-utilized.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impact">Environmental impact</span></h2>
<p>Using biomass as a fuel produces <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> in the form of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/NOx" title="NOx">NOx</a> (nitrogen oxides), VOCs (<a href="/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound" title="Volatile organic compound">volatile organic compounds</a>), particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> in some cases (such as with indoor heating and cooking). Utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications. <a href="/wiki/Black_carbon" title="Black carbon">Black carbon</a> – a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass – is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming. In 2009 a Swedish study of the <a href="/wiki/Asian_brown_cloud" title="Asian brown cloud">giant brown haze</a> that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by open burning of biomass, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning. Researchers measured a significant concentration of <a href="/wiki/Carbon-14" title="Carbon-14">C</a>, which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Biomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the (bulky) fuel play a key factor in the plant's economics. It has to be noted, however, that rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly, which has led to a global biomass market. To make small plants of 1 MW<sub>el</sub> economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as ORC technology, a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic working medium. Such small power plants can be found in Europe.</p>
<p>On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a>. The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight. However, according to the <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed.</p>
<p>Industry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plant's ability to comply with emissions standards. Some of these challenges, unique to biomass plants, include inconsistent fuel supplies and age. The type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors; the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste (such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings). Furthermore, many of the biomass plants are old, use outdated technology and were not built to comply with today’s stringent standards. In fact, many are based on technologies developed during the term of U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, who created the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> in 1977.</p>
<p>The U.S. <a href="/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> projected that by 2017, biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas, slightly more expensive than nuclear power, and much less expensive than solar panels. In another EIA study released, concerning the government’s plan to implement a 25% renewable energy standard by 2025, the agency assumed that 598 million tons of biomass would be available, accounting for 12% of the renewable energy in the plan.</p>
<p>The adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process. Between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14%. In the United States, alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13% of power; of this fraction, biomass contributes approximately 11% of the alternative production. According to a study conducted in early 2012, of the 107 operating biomass plants in the United States, 85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years. This data also includes minor infractions.</p>
<p>Despite harvesting, biomass crops may <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sequestration" title="Carbon sequestration">sequester</a> carbon. For example, soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil, especially at depths below 12 inches. The grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass. Typically, perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass, both living and dead, built up over years, and much less soil disruption in cultivation.</p>
<p>The proposal that biomass is carbon-neutral put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree's carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Current studies indicate that "even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage" and "the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest".</p>
<p>The pros and cons of biomass usage regarding carbon emissions may be quantified with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ILUC" title="ILUC">ILUC</a> factor. There is controversy surrounding the usage of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ILUC" title="ILUC">ILUC</a> factor.</p>
<p>Forest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations, including <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council" title="Natural Resources Defense Council">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate. Greenpeace recently released a report entitled "Fuelling a BioMess" which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass. Because any part of the tree can be burned, the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages <a href="/wiki/Logging#Whole_tree_logging" title="Logging">Whole-Tree Harvesting</a>, which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting, and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest. In some jurisdictions, forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems, including standing trees, naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest. Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees, and even longer in low productivity areas; furthermore, logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon. In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">effects of climate change</a>, a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Supply_chain_issues">Supply chain issues</span></h2>
