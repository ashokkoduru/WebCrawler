<p>A <b>carbon footprint</b> is historically defined as "the total set of <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions caused by an [individual, event, organisation, product] expressed as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent" title="Carbon dioxide equivalent">CO<sub>2</sub>e</a>."</p>
<p>The total carbon footprint cannot be calculated because of the large amount of data required and the fact that carbon dioxide can be produced by natural occurrences. It is for this reason that Wright, Kemp, and Williams, writing in the journal <i>Carbon Management</i>, have suggested a more practicable definition:</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be emitted through transport, land clearance, and the production and consumption of food, fuels, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, and services. For simplicity of reporting, it is often expressed in terms of the amount of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, or its equivalent of other GHGs, emitted.</p>
<p>Most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U.S. household come from "indirect" sources, i.e. fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final consumer. These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in one's car or stove, commonly referred to as "direct" sources of the consumer's carbon footprint.</p>
<p>The concept name of the carbon footprint originates from <a href="/wiki/Ecological_footprint" title="Ecological footprint">ecological footprint</a>, discussion, which was developed by Rees and Wackernagel in the 1990s which estimates the number of "earths" that would theoretically be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint. However, given that ecological footprints are a measure of failure, Anindita Mitra (CREA, Seattle) chose the more easily calculated "carbon footprint" to easily measure use of carbon, as an indicator of unsustainable energy use. In 2007, carbon footprints was used as a measure of carbon emissions to develop the energy plan for City of Lynnwood, Washington. Carbon footprints are much more specific than ecological footprints since they measure direct emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also includes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_footprint" title="Water footprint">water footprint</a> and <a href="/wiki/Land_footprint" title="Land footprint">land footprint</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measuring_carbon_footprints">Measuring carbon footprints</span></h2>
<p>An individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment or other calculative activities denoted as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_accounting" title="Carbon accounting">carbon accounting</a>. Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, e.g. by technological developments, better process and product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_capture" title="Carbon capture">carbon capture</a>, consumption strategies, carbon offsetting and others.</p>
<p>Several free online carbon footprint calculators exist, including a few supported by publicly available peer-reviewed data and calculations including the University of California, Berkeley's CoolClimate Network research consortium and CarbonStory. These websites ask you to answer more or less detailed questions about your diet, transportation choices, home size, shopping and recreational activities, usage of electricity, heating, and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators, and so on. The website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions. A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual/household carbon footprints. This review identified 13 calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the 15 most popular online carbon footprint calculators. The research documented significant shortcomings of a majority of the calculators.</p>
<p>The mitigation of carbon footprints through the development of alternative projects, such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind energy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Reforestation" title="Reforestation">reforestation</a>, represents one way of reducing a carbon footprint and is often known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_offsetting" title="Carbon offsetting">carbon offsetting</a>.</p>
<p>The main influences on carbon footprints include population, economic output, and energy and carbon intensity of the economy. These factors are the main targets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints. Scholars suggest the most effective way to decrease a carbon footprint is to either decrease the amount of Energy Needed for production or to decrease the dependence on carbon emitting fuels.</p>

<p>The average U.S. household carbon footprint is about 50 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year. The single largest source of emissions for the typical household is from driving (gasoline use). Transportation as a whole (driving, flying &amp; small amount from public transit) is the largest overall category, followed by housing (electricity, natural gas, waste, construction) then food (mostly from red meat, dairy and seafood products, but also includes emissions from all other food), then goods followed lastly by services. The carbon footprint of U.S. households is about 5 times greater than the global average, which is approximately 10 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per household per year. For most U.S. households, the single most important action to reduce their carbon footprint is driving less or switching to a more efficient vehicle.</p>

<p>The following table compares, from peer-reviewed studies of full life cycle emissions and from various other studies, the carbon footprint of various forms of energy generation: nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, solar cell, peat and wind generation technology.</p>


<p>Note: 3.6 MJ = megajoule(s) == 1 kW·h = kilowatt-hour(s), thus 1 g/MJ = 3.6 g/kW·h.<br/>
Legend: B = Black coal (supercritical)–(new subcritical), Br = Brown coal (new subcritical), cc = combined cycle, oc = open cycle, T<sub>L</sub> = low-temperature/closed-circuit (geothermal doublet), T<sub>H</sub> = high-temperature/open-circuit, W<sub>L</sub> = Light Water Reactors, W<sub>H</sub> = Heavy Water Reactors, #Educated estimate.</p>
<p>These three studies thus concluded that hydroelectric, wind, and nuclear power produced the least CO<sub>2</sub> per kilowatt-hour of any other electricity sources. These figures do not allow for emissions due to accidents or terrorism. <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">Wind power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, emit no carbon from the operation, but do leave a footprint during construction phase and maintenance during operation. <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">Hydropower</a> from reservoirs also has large footprints from initial removal of vegetation and ongoing methane (stream detritus decays anaerobically to methane in bottom of reservoir, rather than aerobically to CO<sub>2</sub> if it had stayed in an unrestricted stream).</p>
<p>The table above gives the carbon footprint per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, which is about half the world's man-made CO<sub>2</sub> output. The CO<sub>2</sub> footprint for heat is equally significant and research shows that using waste heat from power generation in combined heat and power district heating, chp/dh has the lowest carbon footprint, much lower than micro-power or heat pumps.</p>

<p>Some representative figures for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are provided by LIPASTO's survey of average direct emissions (not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects) of airliners expressed as CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per passenger kilometre:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domestic, short distance, less than 463 km (288 mi): 257 g/km CO<sub>2</sub> or 259 g/km (14.7 oz/mile) CO<sub>2</sub>e</li>
<li>Long distance flights: 113 g/km CO<sub>2</sub> or 114 g/km (6.5 oz/mile) CO<sub>2</sub>e</li>
</ul>
<p>However, emissions per unit distance traveled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel, because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel. It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint, not the merely rate of emissions. For example, a greatly more distant holiday destination may be chosen than if another mode of travel were used, because air travel makes the longer distance feasible in the limited time available.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Indirect_carbon_emissions:_the_carbon_footprints_of_products">Indirect carbon emissions: the carbon footprints of products</span></h2>
<p>Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use, and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products. The US Environmental Protection Agency has addressed paper, plastic (candy wrappers), glass, cans, computers, carpet and tires. Australia has addressed lumber and other building materials. Academics in Australia, Korea and the US have addressed paved roads. Companies, nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages. Carnegie Mellon University has estimated the CO<sub>2</sub> footprints of 46 large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries. Carnegie Mellon, Sweden and the Carbon Trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants.</p>
<p>The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods, shirts and detergents, introducing a <a href="/wiki/Carbon_emission_label" title="Carbon emission label">CO<sub>2</sub> label</a> in March 2007. The label is intended to comply with a new British <a href="/wiki/Publicly_Available_Specification" title="Publicly Available Specification">Publicly Available Specification</a> (i.e. not a standard), PAS 2050, and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners. As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27,000 certifiable product carbon footprints.</p>
<p>Evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint. The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item. For example, a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton, a beer can is made of aluminum, and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic. The larger the size, the larger the footprint will be.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Textiles">Textiles</span></h3>
<p>The precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors. However, studies of textile production in Europe suggest the following carbon dioxide equivalent emissions footprints per kilo of texile at the point of purchase by a consumer:</p>

<li>Cotton: 7</li>
<li>Nylon: 5.43</li>
<li>PET (e.g. synthetic fleece): 5.55</li>

<p>Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_offset" title="Carbon offset">carbon offsets</a> can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a <i>mandatory market</i> and a <i>voluntary market</i>. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Certified_Emission_Reduction" title="Certified Emission Reduction">Certified Emission Reduction</a> (CER)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Emission_Reduction_Unit" title="Emission Reduction Unit">Emission Reduction Unit</a> (ERU)</li>

</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mandatory_market_mechanisms">Mandatory market mechanisms</span></h3>
<p>To reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following <a href="/wiki/Flexible_Mechanisms" title="Flexible Mechanisms">flexible mechanisms</a> were introduced for the mandatory market:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Clean_Development_Mechanism" title="Clean Development Mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism</a> (CDM)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Joint_Implementation" title="Joint Implementation">Joint Implementation</a> (JI)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">Emissions trading</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_Trading" title="Emissions Trading">Emissions Trading</a> allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.</p>
<p>- Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Certified_Emissions_Reduction" title="Certified Emissions Reduction">Certified Emissions Reductions</a> (CERs).<br/>
- Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate <a href="/wiki/Emission_Reduction_Unit" title="Emission Reduction Unit">Emission Reduction Units</a> (ERUs).</p>
<p>The CERs and ERUs can then be sold through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_Trading" title="Emissions Trading">Emissions Trading</a>. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:</p>
<p>- Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.<br/>
- Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.</p>
<p>Nations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_Trading" title="Emissions Trading">Emissions Trading</a> to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls. Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries. If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_Trading" title="Emissions Trading">Emissions Trading</a>. While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_Trading" title="Emissions Trading">Emissions Trading</a> and setting a <a href="/wiki/Market_price" title="Market price">market price</a> for emissions.</p>
<p>A well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EU_Emissions_Trading_Scheme" title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU Emissions Trading Scheme</a> (EU ETS).</p>
<p>New changes are being made to the trading schemes. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EU_Emissions_Trading_Scheme" title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU Emissions Trading Scheme</a> is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.</p>
<p>Other nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few year. These nations include China, India and the United States.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voluntary_market_mechanisms">Voluntary market mechanisms</span></h3>
<p>In contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in the mandatory market.</p>
<p>The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Climate_Exchange" title="Chicago Climate Exchange">Chicago Climate Exchange</a> is a voluntary yet legally binding <a href="/wiki/Emissions_trading" title="Emissions trading">cap-and-trade emission scheme</a> whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_neutral" title="Carbon neutral">carbon neutral</a>. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.</p>
<p>There are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain—from project developer to retailer.</p>
<p>While some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that <a href="/wiki/Forestry" title="Forestry">forestry</a> projects foster. Project types in the voluntary market range from avoided <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_sink" title="Carbon dioxide sink">sequestration</a>, increased <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a>, fuel switching, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">methane capture</a> from coal plants and <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture#Livestock" title="Climate change and agriculture">livestock</a>, and even <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to <a href="/wiki/Carbon_credit#Additionality_and_its_importance" title="Carbon credit">additionality</a> concerns. Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs. Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit; which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market.</p>
<p>The size and activity of the voluntary carbon market is difficult to measure. The most comprehensive report on the voluntary carbon markets to date was released by Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance in July 2007.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%C3%86ON" title="ÆON">ÆON</a> of Japan is firstly approved by Japanese authority to indicate carbon footprint on three <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Private_brand" title="Private brand">private brand</a> goods in October 2009.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ways_to_reduce_carbon_footprint">Ways to reduce carbon footprint</span></h2>
<p>The most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to <a href="/wiki/Waste_hierarchy" title="Waste hierarchy">Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse</a>. In manufacturing this can be done by recycling the packing materials, by selling the obsolete inventory of one industry to the industry who is looking to buy unused items at lesser price to become competitive. Nothing should be disposed off into the soil, all the ferrous materials which are prone to degrade or oxidize with time should be sold as early as possible at reduced price.</p>
<p>This can also be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones. If that option isn't available, it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use. When one household recycles at least half of their household waste, they can save 1.2 tons of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
<p>Another easy option is to drive less. By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving, not only is a person going to save money on gas, but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere. However, if walking is not an option, one can look into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carpooling" title="Carpooling">carpooling</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mass_transportation" title="Mass transportation">mass transportation</a> options in their area.</p>
<p>Yet another option for reducing the <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weather_stripping" title="Weather stripping">weather stripping</a> or <a href="/wiki/Caulking" title="Caulking">caulking</a> around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. Similarly, one can very inexpensively upgrade the "insulation" (clothing) worn by residents of the home. For example, it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear (top and bottom) made from a lightweight, super insulating fabric like microfleece (<i>aka</i> Polartec®, Capilene®) can conserve as much body heat as a full set of clothing, allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5 °C. These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day, and keep temperatures moderate at all times. Setting the thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about 1 ton of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> each year.</p>
<p>Choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long distance and/or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet. Scientists at the University of Chicago have estimated "that the average American diet – which derives 28% of its calories from animal foods – is responsible for approximately one and a half more tonnes of greenhouse gasses – as CO2 equivalents – per person, per year than a fully plant-based, or vegan, diet." Their calculations suggest that even replacing one third of the animal protein in the average American's diet with plant protein (e.g., beans, grains) can reduce the diet's carbon footprint by half a tonne. Exchanging two thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius. Finally, throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint, it adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition, mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas, methane.</p>
<p>The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting, like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions, to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their "handprint."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> footprint in the <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a> industry can be reduced by optimizing the <a href="/wiki/Supply_chain" title="Supply chain">supply chain</a>. A life cycle or supply chain <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify critical areas for improvement and provides a focus. Such studies also demonstrate a company’s commitment to reducing carbon footprint now ahead of other competitors as well as preparing companies for potential regulation. In addition to increased market advantage and differentiation eco-efficiency can also help to reduce costs where <a href="/wiki/Alternative_energy" title="Alternative energy">alternative energy</a> systems are implemented.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="GHG_footprint">GHG footprint</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/GHG_footprint" title="GHG footprint">GHG footprint</a>, or greenhouse gas footprint, refers to the amount of GHG that are emitted during the creation of products or services.
