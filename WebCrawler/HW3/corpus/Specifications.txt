<p>There are different types of specifications, which generally are mostly types of documents, forms or orders or relates to information in databases. The word <i>specification</i> is defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or "to be specific". A specification may refer to a type of <a href="/wiki/Technical_standard" title="Technical standard">technical standard</a> (the main topic of this page).</p>
<p>Using a word "specification" without additional information to what kind of specification you refer to is confusing and considered bad practice within <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">systems engineering</a>.</p>
<p>A <b>requirement specification</b> is a set of documented <a href="/wiki/Requirement" title="Requirement">requirements</a> to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.</p>
<p>A <b>functional specification</b> is closely related to the requirement specification and may show functional block diagrams.</p>
<p>A <b>design or product specification</b> describes the features of the solutions for the Requirement Specification, referring to the designed solution <b>or</b> final produced solution. Sometimes the term <i>specification</i> is here used in connection with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Data_sheet" title="Data sheet">data sheet</a> (or <i>spec sheet</i>). This may be confusing. A data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product as designed and/or produced. It can be published by a manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. A data sheet is not a technical specification as described in this article.</p>
<p>A "<b>in-service</b>" or "<b>maintained as</b>" <b>specification</b>, specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation, including the effects of wear and maintenance (configuration changes).</p>
<p>Specifications may also refer to technical standards, which may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations, both <a href="/wiki/Public_sector" title="Public sector">public</a> and <a href="/wiki/Private_sector" title="Private sector">private</a>. Example organization types include a <a href="/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">corporation</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Consortium" title="Consortium">consortium</a> (a small group of corporations), a <a href="/wiki/Trade_association" title="Trade association">trade association</a> (an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its <a href="/wiki/Military" title="Military">military</a>, <a href="/wiki/Regulatory_agency" title="Regulatory agency">regulatory agencies</a>, and national laboratories and institutes), a <a href="/wiki/Professional_association" title="Professional association">professional association</a> (society), a purpose-made <a href="/wiki/Standards_organization" title="Standards organization">standards organization</a> such as <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a>, or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements. It is common for one organization to <i>refer to</i> (<i>reference</i>, <i>call out</i>, <i>cite</i>) the standards of another. Voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Construction_specifications_in_North_America">Construction specifications in North America</span></h2>
<p>Specifications in North America form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a <a href="/wiki/Building" title="Building">building</a>. The guiding master document is the latest edition of <a href="/wiki/MasterFormat" title="MasterFormat">MasterFormat</a>. It is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organisations: <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Construction_Specifications_Canada&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Construction Specifications Canada (page does not exist)">Construction Specifications Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Construction_Specifications_Institute" title="Construction Specifications Institute">Construction Specifications Institute</a>.</p>
<p>While there is a tendency to believe that "Specs overrule Drawings" in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings, the actual intent—made explicit in the contract between the Owner and the Contractor—is for the drawings and specifications to be complementary, together providing the information required for a complete facility.</p>
<p>The specifications fall into <a href="/wiki/50_Divisions" title="50 Divisions">50 Divisions</a>, or broad categories of work results involved in construction. The divisions are subdivided into sections, each one addressing a narrow scope of the construction work. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Firestop" title="Firestop">firestopping</a> is addressed in Section 078400 - Firestopping. It forms part of Division 07, which is Thermal and Moisture Protection. Division 07 also addresses <a href="/wiki/Building_envelope" title="Building envelope">building envelope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fireproofing" title="Fireproofing">fireproofing</a> work.</p>
<p>Each Section is subdivided into three distinct Parts: "General", "Products" and "Execution". The MasterFormat system can be successfully applied to residential, commercial, civil, and industrial construction. Although many Architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use ArCHspec (which was specifically created for residential projects).</p>
<p>Specifications can be either "performance-based", whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work, or "prescriptive", whereby the specifier indicates specific products, vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope. Most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and prescriptive types, naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met.</p>
<p>While North American specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work, <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> ones can include actual work quantities, including such things as <a href="/wiki/Area" title="Area">area</a> of <a href="/wiki/Drywall" title="Drywall">drywall</a> to be built in square metres, like a bill of materials. This type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a <a href="/wiki/Quantity_surveyor" title="Quantity surveyor">quantity surveyor</a>. This approach is unusual in North America, where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications.</p>
<p>Although specifications are usually issued by the <a href="/wiki/Architect" title="Architect">architect</a>'s office, specwriting itself is undertaken by the architect and the various <a href="/wiki/Architectural_engineering" title="Architectural engineering">engineers</a> or by specialist specwriters. Specwriting is often a distinct professional trade, with professional certifications such as "Certified Construction Specifier" (CCS) through the professional organizations noted above. Specwriters are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects, engineers, or construction management companies. Specwriters frequently meet with manufacturers of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Building_materials" title="Building materials">building materials</a> who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals.</p>
<p>In February 2015, ArCHspec went live, from ArCH (Architects Creating Homes), a nationwide American professional society of Architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture. ArCHspec was created specifically for use by Licensed Architects while designing SFR (Single Family Residential) architectural projects. Unlike the more commercial CSI (50+ division commercial specifications), ArCHspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional Divisions, plus a Division 0 (Scope &amp; Bid Forms) and Division 17 (low voltage). Many Architects, up to this point, did not provide specifications for residential designs, which is one of the reasons ArCHspec was created: to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Construction_specifications_in_the_UK">Construction specifications in the UK</span></h2>
<p>Specifications in the UK are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building. They are prepared by construction professionals such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Architects" title="Architects">architects</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Architectural_technologists" title="Architectural technologists">architectural technologists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Structural_engineer" title="Structural engineer">structural engineers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Landscape_architect" title="Landscape architect">landscape architects</a> and <a href="/wiki/Building_services_engineering" title="Building services engineering">building services engineers</a>. They are created from previous project specifications, in-house documents or master specifications such as the <a href="/wiki/National_Building_Specification" title="National Building Specification">National Building Specification</a> (NBS). The National Building Specification is owned by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects" title="Royal Institute of British Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> (RIBA) through their commercial group RIBA Enterprises (RIBAe). NBS master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive, and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date. UK project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and performance. Prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic or proprietary descriptions of what is required, whereas performance specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the components. Specifications are an integral part of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling" title="Building Information Modeling">Building Information Modeling</a> and cover the non-geometric requirements.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Construction_specifications_in_other_countries">Construction specifications in other countries</span></h2>
<p><b>Egypt</b> : Specifications are part of contract documents. The Housing and Building National Research Center "<a class="external text" href="http://www.hbrc.edu.eg/en/Home.html" rel="nofollow">HBRC</a>" is responsible for developing construction specifications and codes. The HBRC had published more than 15 books which cover building activities like (Earthworks - Plastering - etc.)</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_and_drug_specifications">Food and drug specifications</span></h2>
<p>Pharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various <a href="/wiki/Pharmacopoeia" title="Pharmacopoeia">Pharmacopoeia</a>. Current existing pronounced standards include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/British_Pharmacopoeia" title="British Pharmacopoeia">British Pharmacopoeia</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above <a href="/wiki/Technical_standard" title="Technical standard">standards</a>, it can be evaluated by the additional source of <a href="/wiki/Pharmacopoeia" title="Pharmacopoeia">Pharmacopoeia</a> from other nations, from industrial specifications, or from a standardized <a href="/wiki/Formulary_(pharmacy)" title="Formulary (pharmacy)">formulary</a> such as</p>
<ul>

<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Formulary" title="National Formulary">National Formulary</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing, of which <a href="/wiki/Codex_Alimentarius" title="Codex Alimentarius">Codex Alimentarius</a> ranks the highest standards, followed by regional and national standards.</p>
<p>The coverage of food and drug <a href="/wiki/Technical_standard" title="Technical standard">standards</a> by <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a> is currently less fruitful and not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of regional or national constitution</p>
<p>Specifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed above, but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications. These exist not only for the <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">food</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> product but also for the processing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Machinery" title="Machinery">machinery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quality_(business)" title="Quality (business)">quality</a> processes, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packaging" title="Packaging">packaging</a>, <a href="/wiki/Logistics" title="Logistics">logistics</a> (<a href="/wiki/Cold_chain" title="Cold chain">cold chain</a>), etc. and are exemplified by <i>ISO 14134</i> and <i>ISO 15609</i></p>
<p>The converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing with observations that are out-of-specification. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)" title="Food and Drug Administration (United States)">United States Food and Drug Administration</a> has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses just this point.</p>
<p>At the present time, much of the information and regulations concerning food and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated information processing, storage and transmission methods and techniques.</p>
<p>Data systems that can process, store and transfer information about food and food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>Development of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing systems have begun to emerge from government agencies and standards organizations.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)" title="Food and Drug Administration (United States)">United States Food and Drug Administration</a> has published specifications for a "Structured Product Label" which drug manufacturers must by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a> has made some progress in the area of food and drug <a href="/wiki/Technical_standard" title="Technical standard">standards</a> and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the publication of <i>ISO 11238</i></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Information_technology">Information technology</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specification_need">Specification need</span></h3>
<p>Specifications are needed to avoid errors due to lack of compatibility, for instance, in interoperability issues.</p>
<p>For instance, when two applications share Unicode data, but use different normal forms or use them incorrectly, in an incompatible way or without sharing a minimum set of interoperability specification, errors and data loss can result. For example, Mac OS X has many components that prefer or require only decomposed characters (thus decomposed-only Unicode encoded with UTF-8 is also known as "UTF8-MAC"). In one specific instance, the combination of OS X errors handling composed characters, and the <a href="/wiki/Samba_(software)" title="Samba (software)">samba</a> file- and printer-sharing software (which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names), has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems.</p>
<p>Applications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points, and only normalizing them to the application's preferred normal form for internal use.</p>
<p>Such errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before any binary comparison.</p>
<p>However errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed, due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to be inter-operable between various file system drivers, operating systems, network protocols, and thousands of software packages.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Formal_specification" title="Formal specification">Formal specification</a></div>

It describes <i>what</i> the system should do, not (necessarily) <i>how</i> the system should do it. Given such a specification, it is possible to use <a href="/wiki/Formal_verification" title="Formal verification">formal verification</a> techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design.
