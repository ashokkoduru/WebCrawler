<p><b>Human rights</b> are <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">moral</a> principles or <a href="/wiki/Norm_(social)" title="Norm (social)">norms</a>, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legal_rights" title="Legal rights">legal rights</a> in <a href="/wiki/Municipal_law" title="Municipal law">municipal</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a>. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental <a href="/wiki/Rights" title="Rights">rights</a> "to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being," and which are "inherent in all human beings" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being <a href="/wiki/Universality_(philosophy)" title="Universality (philosophy)">universal</a>, and they are <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of <a href="/wiki/Due_process" title="Due process">due process</a> based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unlawful_imprisonment" title="Unlawful imprisonment">unlawful imprisonment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Execution" title="Execution">execution</a>.</p>
<p>The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a>, global and regional institutions. Actions by <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">states</a> and <a href="/wiki/Non-governmental_organization" title="Non-governmental organization">non-governmental organizations</a> form a basis of <a href="/wiki/Public_policy" title="Public policy">public policy</a> worldwide. The idea of human rights suggests that "if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights." The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable skepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term <i><a href="/wiki/Rights" title="Rights">right</a></i> is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the <a href="/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial" title="Right to a fair trial">right to a fair trial</a>, protection against <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">enslavement</a>, prohibition of <a href="/wiki/Genocide" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">free speech</a>, or a <a href="/wiki/Right_to_education" title="Right to education">right to education</a>, there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard.</p>
<p>Many of the basic ideas that animated the <a href="/wiki/Human_rights_movement" title="Human rights movement">human rights movement</a> developed in the aftermath of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> and the atrocities of <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, culminating in the adoption of the <i><a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></i> in Paris by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> in 1948. Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of <a href="/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights" title="Natural and legal rights">natural rights</a> which appeared as part of the medieval <a href="/wiki/Natural_law" title="Natural law">natural law</a> tradition that became prominent during the European <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> with such philosophers as <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)" title="Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)">Francis Hutcheson</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Burlamaqui" title="Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui">Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui</a>, and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> and the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the twentieth century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide, and war crimes, as a realization of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a <a href="/wiki/Just_society" title="Just society">just society</a>.</p>

<p>Although ideas of rights and liberty have existed in some form for much of human history, there is agreement that the earlier conceptions do not closely resemble the modern conceptions of human rights. According to Jack Donnelly, in the ancient world, "traditional societies typically have had elaborate systems of duties... conceptions of justice, political legitimacy, and human flourishing that sought to realize human dignity, flourishing, or well-being entirely independent of human rights. These institutions and practices are alternative to, rather than different formulations of, human rights". The history of human rights can be traced to past documents, particularly <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a> (622), <a href="/wiki/Al-Risalah_al-Huquq" title="Al-Risalah al-Huquq">Al-Risalah al-Huquq</a> (659-713), <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> (1215), the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Articles" title="Twelve Articles">Twelve Articles of Memmingen</a> (1525), the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="Bill of Rights 1689">English Bill of Rights</a> (1689), the French <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> (1789), and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" title="United States Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a> (1791).</p>
<p>The modern sense of human rights can be traced to <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> Europe and the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, alongside the disappearance of the <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudal</a> authoritarianism and religious conservativism that dominated the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. One theory is that human rights were developed during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Early_Modern_period" title="Early Modern period">early Modern period</a>, alongside the European secularization of Judeo-Christian ethics. The most commonly held view is that the concept of human rights evolved in the West, and that while earlier cultures had important ethical concepts, they generally lacked a concept of human rights. For example, McIntyre argues there is no word for "right" in any language before 1400. Medieval charters of liberty such as the English <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> were not charters of human rights, rather they were the foundation and constituted a form of limited political and legal agreement to address specific political circumstances, in the case of Magna Carta later being recognized in the course of early modern debates about rights. One of the oldest records of human rights is the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Kalisz" title="Statute of Kalisz">statute of Kalisz</a> (1264), giving privileges to the Jewish minority in the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)" title="Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)">Kingdom of Poland</a> such as protection from discrimination and hate speech. <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Moyn" title="Samuel Moyn">Samuel Moyn</a> suggests that the concept of human rights is intertwined with the modern sense of <a href="/wiki/History_of_citizenship" title="History of citizenship">citizenship</a>, which did not emerge until the past few hundred years.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="16th.E2.80.9318th_century">16th–18th century</span></h3>
<p>The earliest conceptualization of human rights is credited to ideas about <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_rights" title="Natural rights">natural rights</a> emanating from <a href="/wiki/Natural_law" title="Natural law">natural law</a>. In particular, the issue of universal rights was introduced by the examination of extending rights to indigenous peoples by Spanish clerics, such as <a href="/wiki/Francisco_de_Vitoria" title="Francisco de Vitoria">Francisco de Vitoria</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_Las_Casas" title="Bartolomé de Las Casas">Bartolomé de Las Casas</a>.

<p>17th-century English philosopher <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the <a href="/wiki/Social_contract" title="Social contract">social contract</a>. In Britain in 1689, the English <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="Bill of Rights 1689">Bill of Rights</a> and the Scottish <a href="/wiki/Claim_of_Right_Act_1689" title="Claim of Right Act 1689">Claim of Right</a> each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions. Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> and the French <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" title="Virginia Declaration of Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civil_rights" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> and civil freedoms.</p>

<p>These were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">G.W.F.

The term <i>human rights</i> probably came into use some time between Paine's <i>The Rights of Man</i> and <a href="/wiki/William_Lloyd_Garrison" title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>'s 1831 writings in <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Liberator_(newspaper)" title="The Liberator (newspaper)">The Liberator</a></i>, in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights". Although the term had been used by at least one author as early as 1742.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19th_century">19th century</span></h3>
<p>In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. A number of reformers, notably British Member of Parliament <a href="/wiki/William_Wilberforce" title="William Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, worked towards the abolition of the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" title="Abolitionism">abolition of slavery</a>. This was achieved across the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_1807" title="Slave Trade Act 1807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a>, which was <a href="/wiki/Blockade_of_Africa" title="Blockade of Africa">enforced internationally</a> by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations, and the <a href="/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833" title="Slavery Abolition Act 1833">Slavery Abolition Act 1833</a>. In the United States, all the northern states had <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">abolished</a> the institution of slavery between 1777 and 1804, although southern states clung tightly to the "peculiar institution". Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states' <a href="/wiki/Secession" title="Secession">secession</a> and the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="Reconstruction era of the United States">reconstruction period</a> immediately following the war, several amendments to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a> were made. These included the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">13th amendment</a>, banning slavery, the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">14th amendment</a>, assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the <a href="/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">15th amendment</a>, guaranteeing <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> the right to vote. In <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the reformer <a href="/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia" title="Alexander II of Russia">Tsar Alexander II</a> ended serfdom in 1861, although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation.</p>
<p>Many groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and North America, <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">labour unions</a> brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Child_labor" title="Child labor">child labour</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_rights" title="Women's rights">women's rights</a> movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to <a href="/wiki/Voting" title="Voting">vote</a>. <a href="/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation" title="Wars of national liberation">National liberation movements</a> in many countries succeeded in driving out <a href="/wiki/Colony" title="Colony">colonial</a> powers. One of the most influential was <a href="/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%931968)" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)">African American Civil Rights Movement</a>, and more recent diverse <a href="/wiki/Identity_politics" title="Identity politics">identity politics</a> movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>
<p>The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern <a href="/wiki/International_human_rights_instruments" title="International human rights instruments">human rights instruments</a>. The <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> following the end of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>At the 1945 <a href="/wiki/Yalta_Conference" title="Yalta Conference">Yalta Conference</a>, the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. The United Nations has played an important role in international human-rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up <a href="/wiki/International_humanitarian_law" title="International humanitarian law">international humanitarian law</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_human_rights_law" title="International human rights law">international human rights law</a>. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organizations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Western_bloc" title="Western bloc">western</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eastern_bloc" title="Eastern bloc">eastern</a> Cold War blocs. Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasized in the latter half of the twentieth century because it "provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and post colonialist.</p>

<p>The CDHR was signed by member states of the OIC in 1990 at the 19th Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo, Egypt. It was seen as the answer to the UDHR. In fact, the CDHR was "patterned after the UN-sponsored UDHR of 1948". The object of the CDHR was to "serve as a guide for member states on human rights issues. CDHR translated the Qur'anic teachings as follows: "All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. True religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity. On top of references to the Qur'an, the CDHR also referenced prophetic teachings and Islamic legal tradition.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy">Philosophy</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_human_rights" title="Philosophy of human rights">Philosophy of human rights</a></div>
<p>The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights have become a part of social expectations.</p>
<p>One of the oldest Western philosophies of human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behaviour which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">Hume</a>). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Weber</a>). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in <a href="/wiki/John_Rawls" title="John Rawls">Rawls</a>) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom. Other positions attempt to categorize rights into basic types, rather than make claims about the function or derivation of particular rights.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h3>
<p>The claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism. Philosophers who have criticized the concept of human rights include <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham" title="Jeremy Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Burke" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. Political philosophy professor <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Charles_Blattberg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Charles Blattberg (page does not exist)">Charles Blattberg</a> argues that discussion of human rights, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to affirm. The <a href="/wiki/Internet_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy" title="Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> gives particular attention to two types of criticisms: the one questioning universality of human rights and the one denying them objective ground. <a href="/wiki/Alain_Pellet" title="Alain Pellet">Alain Pellet</a>, an international law scholar, criticizes "human rightism" approach as denying the principle of sovereignty and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law; <a href="/wiki/Alain_de_Benoist" title="Alain de Benoist">Alain de Benoist</a> questions human rights premises of human equality. <a href="/wiki/David_Kennedy_(jurist)" title="David Kennedy (jurist)">David Kennedy</a> had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in <i>Harvard Human Rights Journal</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<p>Human rights can be classified and organized in several different ways. At an international level the most common categorization of human rights has been to split them into <a href="/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights" title="Civil and political rights">civil and political rights</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights" title="Economic, social and cultural rights">economic, social and cultural rights</a>.</p>
<p>Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR) and in the <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ICCPR" title="ICCPR">ICCPR</a>). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR) and in the <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights" title="International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ICESCR" title="ICESCR">ICESCR</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Indivisibility">Indivisibility</span></h3>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UDHR" title="UDHR">UDHR</a> included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the <i>full belly thesis</i>).</p>
<p>The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 <a href="/wiki/Vienna_Declaration_and_Programme_of_Action" title="Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action">Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).</p>
<p>Although accepted by the signatories to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UDHR" title="UDHR">UDHR</a>, most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the <a href="/wiki/Right_to_work" title="Right to work">right to work</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Right_to_education" title="Right to education">education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Right_to_health" title="Right to health">health</a> and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Categorization">Categorization</span></h3>
<p>Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches. Economic, social and cultural rights are argued to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>aspirations or goals</i>, as opposed to real 'legal' rights</li>
<li><i>ideologically divisive/political</i>, meaning that there is no consensus on what should and shouldn't be provided as a right</li>
<li><i>non-justiciable</i>, meaning that their provision, or the breach of them, cannot be judged in a court of law</li>
<li><i>positive</i>, meaning that they require active provision of entitlements by the state (as opposed to the state being required only to prevent the breach of rights)</li>
<li><i>progressive</i>, meaning that they will take significant time to implement</li>
<li><i>resource-intensive</i>, meaning that they are expensive and difficult to provide</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a></i>, as opposed to <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a></li>
<li><i>vague</i>, meaning they cannot be quantitatively measured, and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly civil and political rights are categorized as:</p>

</ul>
<p>Olivia Ball and Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorization. Among several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real 'legal' right.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Three_generations">Three generations</span></h3>
<p>Another categorization, offered by <a href="/wiki/Karel_Vasak" title="Karel Vasak">Karel Vasak</a>, is that there are <i><a href="/wiki/Three_generations_of_human_rights" title="Three generations of human rights">three generations of human rights</a></i>: first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorization is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritization of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. Human rights expert <a href="/wiki/Philip_Alston" title="Philip Alston">Philip Alston</a> argues:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He, and others, urge caution with prioritization of rights:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>[T]he call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Philip Alston</cite></div>

<p>Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some human rights are said to be "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inalienable_rights" title="Inalienable rights">inalienable rights</a>". The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."</p>

The foundation of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practice for the protection of human rights.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Charter" title="United Nations Charter">United Nations Charter</a></div>
<p>The provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of Brownlie. The preamble of the charter provides that the members "reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women" and Article 1(3) of the United Nations charter states that one of the purposes of the UN is: "to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion". Article 55 provides that:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The United Nations shall promote: a) higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development; b) solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems; c) international cultural and educational cooperation; d) universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of particular importance is Article 56 of the charter: "All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55." This is a binding treaty provision applicable to both the Organization and its members and has been taken to constitute a legal obligation for the members of the United Nations. Overall, the references to human rights in the Charter are general and vague. The Charter does not contain specific legal rights, nor does it mandate any enforcement procedures to protect these rights. Despite this, the significance of the espousal of human rights within the UN charter must not be understated. The importance of human rights on the global stage can be traced to the importance of human rights within the United Nations framework and the UN Charter can be seen as the starting point for the development of a broad array of declarations, treaties, implementation and enforcement mechanisms, UN organs, committees and reports on the protection of human rights. The rights espoused in the UN charter would be codified and defined in an non-binding context within the International Bill of Human Rights, composing the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and the <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights" title="International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</b> was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. It is generally viewed as the preeminent statement of international rights and has been identified as being a culmination of centuries of thinking along both secular and religious lines. Although the UDHR is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered by some to have acquired the force of international <a href="/wiki/Custom_(law)" title="Custom (law)">customary law</a> which may be invoked in appropriate circumstances by national and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tribunals" title="Tribunals">tribunals</a>.

The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behaviour of states and press upon them duties to their citizens.</p>

<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former <a href="/wiki/First_Lady" title="First Lady">First Lady</a> <a href="/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> as Chair, who began to discuss an <i>International Bill of Rights</i> in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority. Canadian law professor <a href="/wiki/John_Peters_Humphrey" title="John Peters Humphrey">John Humphrey</a> and French lawyer <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Cassin" title="René Cassin">René Cassin</a> were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. According to Cassin, the final three articles place rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized. Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi. The inclusion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that all human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. This principle was not then opposed by any member states (the declaration was adopted unanimously, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Byelorussian_SSR" title="Byelorussian SSR">Byelorussian SSR</a>, <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ukrainian_SSR" title="Ukrainian SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a>, <a href="/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa" title="Union of South Africa">Union of South Africa</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USSR" title="USSR">USSR</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>.); however, this principle was later subject to significant challenges.</p>
<p>The Universal Declaration was bifurcated into treaties, a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and another on social, economic, and cultural rights, due to questions about the relevance and propriety of economic and social provisions in covenants on human rights. Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources. This debate over whether human rights are more fundamental than economic rights has continued to the present day. The United States declared after the World Food Summit that a right to be free from hunger does not give rise to any international obligations which has been interpreted as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Negative_duty" title="Negative duty">negative duty</a>.</p>
<p>The drafters of the Covenants initially intended only one instrument. The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed. The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants. The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human rights which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources. In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognized depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights, which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights. There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socio-economic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.</p>
<p>This debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human-rights law led to the two covenants. The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called <i>Unity Resolution</i>. Both covenants allowed states to derogate some rights. Those in favour of a single treaty could not gain sufficient consensus.</p>

It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively "weak" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies.

In addition to state-sponsored torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can also be for the <a href="/wiki/Sadomasochism" title="Sadomasochism">sadistic</a> gratification of the torturer, as in the <a href="/wiki/Moors_murders" title="Moors murders">Moors murders</a>.</p>
<p>Since the mid-20th century, torture is prohibited under <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> and the domestic laws of most countries.

<p>Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship.

In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on libel, slander, obscenity, incitement to commit a crime, etc. The right to freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the ICCPR states that "[e]veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".</p>

<p>On the other hand, others think that it is no longer primarily individuals but companies that trade, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed as a human right. Additionally, trying to fit too many concepts under the umbrella of what qualifies as a human right has the potential to dilute their importance. Finally, it is difficult to define a right to trade as either "fair" or "just" in that the current trade regime produces winners and losers but its reform is likely to produce (different) winners and losers.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Water_politics" title="Water politics">Water politics</a></div>
<p>The right to water has been recognized in a wide range of international documents, including treaties, declarations and other standards. For instance, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CEDAW" title="CEDAW">CEDAW</a>) requires State parties to ensure to women the right to “enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to […] water supply”. The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires States parties to combat disease and malnutrition “through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water”.</p>
<p>The most clear definition of the Human right to water has been issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty body interpreting legal obligations of State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ICESCR" title="ICESCR">ICESCR</a>) issued in 2002 a non-binding interpretation affirming that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health (see ICESCR Art.11 &amp; 12) and therefore a human right:</p>

<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly declared water and sanitation as human rights. Today all States have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognizes the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognizing this right.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sexual_and_reproductive_rights">Sexual and reproductive rights</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_rights" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a></div>
<p>Human rights include women’s rights and sexual and reproductive rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are part of a continuum of human rights, which includes the rights to life, health and education, the rights to equality and non-discrimination, and the right to decide the timing, number and spacing of one’s children.</p>
<p>Reproductive and sexual rights as part of human rights was affirmed internationally at the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994. It was the first among international development frameworks to address issues related to sexuality, sexual and reproductive health, and reproductive rights.</p>
<p>The ICPD Programme of Action in paragraph 7.2 “defines an individual’s sexual and reproductive health as complete well-being related to sexual activity and reproduction. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) encompass both entitlements and freedoms. This includes the definition of reproductive rights in paragraph 7.3 of the ICPD PoA, which clarifies that these are not a new set of rights but human rights in existing human rights instruments related to sexual and reproductive autonomy and the attainment of sexual and reproductive health. Additionally, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (PfA) expands this definition to cover both sexuality and reproduction by affirming in paragraph 96 the right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.” </p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="World_Health_Organization">World Health Organization</span></h4>
<p>Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nations 1968 International Conference on Human Rights. The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, "Parents have a basic human right to determine <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freedom_of_will" title="Freedom of will">freely</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moral_responsibility" title="Moral responsibility">responsibly</a> the number and the spacing of their children."</p>
<p>Reproductive rights may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, the right to <a href="/wiki/Birth_control" title="Birth control">control one's reproductive functions</a>, the right to quality <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_health" title="Reproductive health">reproductive healthcare</a>, and the right to <a href="/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning">education and access</a> in order to make reproductive choices free from <a href="/wiki/Coercion" title="Coercion">coercion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Discrimination" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Violence" title="Violence">violence</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Right_to_Non-refoulement_vs._Right_to_Asylum">Right to Non-refoulement vs. Right to Asylum</span></h4>
<p>Non-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Both the right to non-refoulement and the right to asylum have taken centre stage in recent debates over the treatment of refugees. A central worry about the right to asylum is that it can limit a states power to handle a mass influx of refugees. Processing asylum applications can take a considerable amount of time, and this amount rises with the amount of refugees applying. This creates an incentive for more refugees to apply, since they are allowed to stay in the country during the application process. One potential solution to the problem of mass influx is proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey. Lamey proposes a portable procedural model that focuses on the right to non-refoulement. Crucially, the procedural rights defended by this model can be applied outside national borders, within any rights respecting country; this allows the burden of mass influx to be shared by a plurality of countries without violating the procedural rights of the refugee.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_environment">The environment</span></h3>
<p>There are two basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system. The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 24 of the <a href="/wiki/African_Charter_on_Human_and_Peoples%27_Rights" title="African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights">African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a>, and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the <a href="/wiki/American_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="American Convention on Human Rights">American Convention on Human Rights</a>). The second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually – the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.</p>
<p>The onset of various <a href="/wiki/List_of_environmental_issues" title="List of environmental issues">environmental issues</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these. Such as the conflict between right to decide number of offspring and the common need for a healthy environment, as noted in the <a href="/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="Tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. In the area of environmental rights, the responsibilities of multinational corporations, so far relatively unaddressed by human rights legislation, is of paramount consideration.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_rights" title="Environmental rights">Environmental rights</a> revolve largely around the idea of a right to a livable environment both for the present and the future generations.</p>

<p>With the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable), the UN recognizes that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency – although</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relativism_and_universalism">Relativism and universalism</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Cultural_relativism" title="Cultural relativism">Cultural relativism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moral_relativism" title="Moral relativism">Moral relativism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Moral_universalism" title="Moral universalism">Moral universalism</a></div>


<p>The UDHR enshrines universal rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to. However, in academia there is a dispute between scholars that advocate <a href="/wiki/Moral_relativism" title="Moral relativism">moral relativism</a> and scholars that advocate <a href="/wiki/Moral_universalism" title="Moral universalism">moral universalism</a>. Relativists do not argue against human rights, but concede that human rights are <a href="/wiki/Social_constructionism" title="Social constructionism">social constructed</a> and are shaped by cultural and environmental contexts. Universalists argue that human rights have always existed, and apply to all people regardless of culture, race, sex, or religion.</p>
<p>More specifically, proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights. Relativists caution that universalism could be used as a form of cultural, economic or political imperialism. <a href="/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden" title="The White Man's Burden">The White Man's Burden</a> is used as an example of imperialism and the destruction of local cultures justified by the desire to spread <a href="/wiki/Eurocentrism" title="Eurocentrism">Eurocentric</a> values. In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically <a href="/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, <a href="/wiki/Human_rights_in_Japan" title="Human rights in Japan">Japan</a> or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.</p>
<p>Opponents of relativism argue that some practices exist that violate the norms of all human cultures. A common example is <a href="/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation" title="Female genital mutilation">female genital mutilation</a>, which occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America. It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.</p>
<p>The former Prime Ministers of <a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, and of <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mahathir_bin_Mohamad" title="Mahathir bin Mohamad">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> both claimed in the 1990s that <i><a href="/wiki/Asian_values" title="Asian values">Asian values</a></i> were significantly different from Western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. <a href="/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> argued that:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>What Asians value may not necessarily be what Americans or Europeans value. Westerners value the freedoms and liberties of the individual. As an Asian of Chinese cultural background, my values are for a government which is honest, effective, and efficient.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— <a href="/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, 'Democracy, Human Rights and the Realities', Tokyo, Nov 10, 1992</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>In response, critics have pointed out that cultural relativism could be used as a justification for authoritarianism. An example is in 1981, when the Iranian representative to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a <a href="/wiki/Secularism" title="Secularism">secular</a> understanding of the <a href="/wiki/Judeo-Christian" title="Judeo-Christian">Judeo-Christian</a> tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law. The Asian Values argument was criticized by Mahathir's former deputy:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite"><cite>— <a href="/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim" title="Anwar Ibrahim">A. Ibrahim</a> in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum title <i>Media and Society in Asia</i>, December 2, 1994</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>and by Singapore's opposition leader <a href="/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan" title="Chee Soon Juan">Chee Soon Juan</a>, who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.</p>
<p>Defenders of moral universalism argue that relativistic arguments neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They argue that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Ignatieff" title="Michael Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a> has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless. This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.</p>
<p>Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The <a href="/wiki/2005_World_Summit" title="2005 World Summit">2005 World Summit</a> reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
