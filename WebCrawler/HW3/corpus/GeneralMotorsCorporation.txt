<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bankruptcy_filing">Bankruptcy filing</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of 1 June 2009, <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet-Saturn_of_Harlem" title="Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem">Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem</a>, a dealership in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> that was owned by GM itself, filed for bankruptcy protection there, followed in the same court by General Motors Corporation (the main GM in Detroit), GM's subsidiary <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saturn_LLC" title="Saturn LLC">Saturn LLC</a>, and Saturn LLC's subsidiary Saturn Distribution Corporation. All cases were assigned to Judge <a href="/wiki/Robert_Gerber" title="Robert Gerber">Robert Gerber</a>.</p>
<p>The filing by the dealership declared General Motors to be a <a href="/wiki/Debtor_in_possession" title="Debtor in possession">debtor in possession</a>. The Manhattan dealership's filing allowed General Motors to file its own bankruptcy petition in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bankruptcy_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York" title="United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York">United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, its preferred court. Normally for such cases, the company would have filed in the courts located in the state(s) where the company is incorporated, or where it conducts operations, which for <a href="/wiki/Detroit" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>-headquartered General Motors would have been the courts in <a href="/wiki/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> or <a href="/wiki/Delaware" title="Delaware">Delaware</a>, where it is incorporated. General Motors' attorneys, however, preferred to file in the federal courts in New York, because those courts have a reputation for expertise in bankruptcy. In a press conference that began four hours and eighteen minutes after the filing, the GM Chief Executive Officer, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fritz_Henderson" title="Fritz Henderson">Fritz Henderson</a>, stressed that he intended for the bankruptcy process to move quickly. In addition to Henderson's press conference, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> made a speech from the <a href="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">White House</a> four hours three minutes after the court filing. This did not include GMCL as this would help the Canadian economy like the pipe line was stated</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obligation_to_privately_owned_individual_franchise_dealerships">Obligation to privately owned individual franchise dealerships</span></h3>

<p>Prior to General Motors <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> filing, U.S. state law governed the minimum required distance between same-franchise dealers; known as the eight-mile rule. The eight-mile rule prohibits same-franchise dealers from locating within eight miles of each other. In 2001 General Motors formally declared Project 2000 would be implemented as part of a brand-channeling strategy designed to consolidate its network of privately owned individual <a href="/wiki/Franchising" title="Franchising">franchise</a> dealerships and reduce the number of locations from 7,300 to 3,800. Project 2000 served as the primary mechanism for combining single-point Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealer locations together forming a single corporate brand division (BPG). Project 2000 also targeted single-point Cadillac-Hummer-Saab dealer locations and allowed single-point Chevrolet and Saturn dealer locations to stand on their own. Project 2000 calculated the <a href="/wiki/Fair_market_value" title="Fair market value">fair market value</a> for each individually owned dealer franchise to be $3,000 per vehicle based on total volume from any one of the previous three years. Upon agreement of a fair market value, dealers with interest in selling their franchise rights were free to negotiate with each other, and ultimately execute a buy-sell agreement which contained mutually agreed upon terms and conditions required to legally sell and transfer franchise <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ownership" title="Ownership">ownership</a> <a href="/wiki/Rights" title="Rights">rights</a>. Section 363 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code expedited General Motors Project 2000 efforts to reduce its dealer network and circumvent state and federal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Criminal" title="Criminal">criminal</a> laws prohibiting the illegal sale of property, or transfer of ownership by an unauthorized party. Thousands of family-owned, [profitable], well-capitalized dealerships were forced to forfeit their franchise rights to a neighboring dealer-competitor selected by General Motors. Compensation has not yet been awarded in cases where individual dealer franchise property and ownership rights were transferred for the purpose of granting such rights to a nearby dealer selected by General Motors. In addition to reports of <a href="/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a> filed with the police, GM dealers joined to form the <a class="external text" href="http://www.hometownautodealers.org" rel="nofollow">Committee to Restore Dealer Rights</a>. The committee to restore dealer rights is responsible for helping draft HR 2743, which asserts the action taken by General Motors to consolidate its dealer network by transferring individual dealer franchise ownership and property without compensation was illegal. As of 22 February 2010, HR 2743 remains in committee.</p>

<p>The General Motors bankruptcy case was formally entitled <i><a href="/wiki/In_re" title="In re">In re</a> General Motors Corp.</i>, case number 09-50026 in the Southern District, Manhattan, New York. General Motors was represented by the New York specialist law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges. The United States Treasury and an ad hoc group of the bondholders of General Motors Corporation were also represented in court.</p>
<p>One of the first motions filed in court was to void the leases on the seven corporate jets, and corporate aircraft hangar at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, which the company said were no longer valuable to the company's business. A GM spokesman said that the company had found itself unable to escape the lease in 2008 when it had tried to.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2009, the court gave interim approval to GM's request to borrow $15 billion as <a href="/wiki/Debtor-in-possession_financing" title="Debtor-in-possession financing">debtor-in-possession financing</a>, the company only having $2 billion cash in hand. The United States Treasury had argued in court that it was the only source of such debtor in possession funding, and that without the money from the loan General Motors would have no option but <a href="/wiki/Liquidation" title="Liquidation">liquidation</a>. Other motions in the first-day hearing included motions to approve payments to key suppliers and to employees and distributors who are in possession of goods manufactured for General Motors. All motions passed in court without substantial objection.</p>
<p>The case schedule laid out by the court was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 19, 2009: Deadline for filing all objections to the sale of General Motors.</li>

Because the price that these assets were expected to sell for was very high, there was expected to be only one bidder in the auction, a new company NGMCO Inc. This company had been formed by the United States government with a 60% stake, the federal government of <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Canada" title="Government of Canada">Canada</a> and provincial government of <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Ontario" title="Government of Ontario">Ontario</a> with a 12% stake, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Auto_Workers" title="United Auto Workers">United Auto Workers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Auto_Workers" title="Canadian Auto Workers">Canadian Auto Workers</a> unions with a 17.5% stake, and the unsecured bondholders of General Motors with a 10% stake.
