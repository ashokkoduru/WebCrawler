<p><a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">Nuclear power</a> relies on fissionable material that can sustain a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction" title="Nuclear chain reaction">chain reaction</a> with <a href="/wiki/Neutron" title="Neutron">neutrons</a>. Examples of such materials include <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>. Most nuclear reactors use a <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">moderator</a> to lower the <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of the neutrons and increase the probability that <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">fission</a> will occur. This allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile" title="Fissile">fissile</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isotopes" title="Isotopes">isotopes</a> than <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. <a href="/wiki/Graphite" title="Graphite">Graphite</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heavy_water" title="Heavy water">heavy water</a> are the most effective moderators, because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_technology" title="Nuclear reactor technology">Reactors</a> using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heavy_water_reactor" title="Heavy water reactor">heavy water</a> or graphite as the moderator can operate using <a href="/wiki/Natural_uranium" title="Natural uranium">natural uranium</a>.</p>
<p>A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactor</a> (LWR) uses water in the form that occurs in nature, and require fuel that is enriched in fissile isotopes, typically uranium <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">enriched</a> to 3â€“5% in the less common isotope <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U-235" title="U-235">U-235</a>, the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature. One alternative to this low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel are <a href="/wiki/MOX_fuel" title="MOX fuel">mixed oxide</a> (MOX) fuels produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium, and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus <a href="/wiki/Weapons-grade" title="Weapons-grade">weapons-grade</a> plutonium. Another type of MOX fuel involves mixing LEU with <a href="/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle" title="Thorium fuel cycle">thorium</a>, which generates the fissile isotope <a href="/wiki/Uranium-233" title="Uranium-233">U-233</a>. Both plutonium and U-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irradiating" title="Irradiating">irradiating</a> <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile materials</a> in a reactor, in particular the common uranium isotope <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">U-238</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, respectively, and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">reprocessing plants</a>.</p>
<p>Some reactors do not use moderators to slow the neutrons. Like nuclear weapons, which also use unmoderated or "fast" neutrons, these <a href="/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor" title="Fast-neutron reactor">fast-neutron reactors</a> require much higher concentrations of fissile isotopes in order to sustain a chain reaction. They are also capable of <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeding</a> fissile isotopes from fertile materials; a <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">breeder reactor</a> is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes.</p>
<p>During the nuclear reaction inside a reactor, the fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel are consumed, producing more and more <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission_product" title="Nuclear fission product">fission products</a>, most of which are considered <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_waste" title="Radioactive waste">radioactive waste</a>. The buildup of fission products and consumption of fissile isotopes eventually stop the nuclear reaction, causing the fuel to become a <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>. When 3% enriched LEU fuel is used, the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1% U-235, 95% U-238, 1% plutonium and 3% fission products. Spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous, although nuclear reactors produce relatively small volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel. Safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power, including their storage and disposal, is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exploration">Exploration</span></h3>
<p>A deposit of uranium, such as <a href="/wiki/Uraninite" title="Uraninite">uraninite</a>, discovered by geophysical techniques, is evaluated and sampled to determine the amounts of uranium materials that are extractable at specified costs from the deposit. Uranium reserves are the amounts of ore that are estimated to be recoverable at stated costs. Uranium in nature consists primarily of two isotopes, U-238 and U-235. The numbers refer to the atomic <a href="/wiki/Mass_number" title="Mass number">mass number</a> for each <a href="/wiki/Isotope" title="Isotope">isotope</a>, or the number of <a href="/wiki/Proton" title="Proton">protons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neutron" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atomic_nucleus" title="Atomic nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. Naturally occurring uranium consists of approximately 99.28% U-238 and 0.71% U-235. The atomic nucleus of U-235 will nearly always fission when struck by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Free_neutron" title="Free neutron">free neutron</a>, and the isotope is therefore said to be a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile" title="Fissile">fissile</a>" isotope. The nucleus of a U-238 atom on the other hand, rather than undergoing fission when struck by a free neutron, will nearly always absorb the neutron and yield an atom of the isotope U-239. This isotope then undergoes natural radioactive decay to yield Pu-239, which, like U-235, is a fissile isotope. The atoms of U-238 are said to be fertile, because, through neutron irradiation in the core, some eventually yield atoms of fissile Pu-239.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mining">Mining</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Uranium_mining" title="Uranium mining">Uranium mining</a></div>
<p>Uranium ore can be extracted through conventional mining in open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other metals. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/In-situ_leach" title="In-situ leach">In-situ leach</a> <a href="/wiki/Mining" title="Mining">mining</a> methods also are used to mine uranium in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. In this technology, uranium is leached from the in-place ore through an array of regularly spaced wells and is then recovered from the leach solution at a surface plant. Uranium ores in the United States typically range from about 0.05 to 0.3% uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). Some uranium deposits developed in other countries are of higher grade and are also larger than deposits mined in the United States. Uranium is also present in very low-grade amounts (50 to 200 parts per million) in some domestic <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a>-bearing deposits of marine origin. Because very large quantities of phosphate-bearing rock are mined for the production of wet-process <a href="/wiki/Phosphoric_acid" title="Phosphoric acid">phosphoric acid</a> used in high analysis <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a> and other phosphate chemicals, at some phosphate processing plants the uranium, although present in very low concentrations, can be economically recovered from the process stream.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Milling">Milling</span></h3>
<p>Mined uranium ores normally are processed by <a href="/wiki/Grinding_(abrasive_cutting)" title="Grinding (abrasive cutting)">grinding</a> the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, "<a href="/wiki/Yellowcake" title="Yellowcake">yellowcake</a>", which is sold on the uranium market as U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Uranium_conversion">Uranium conversion</span></h3>
<p>Milled uranium oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, must be converted to <a href="/wiki/Uranium_hexafluoride" title="Uranium hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a>, UF<sub>6</sub>, which is the form required by most commercial uranium enrichment facilities currently in use. A solid at room temperature, uranium hexafluoride can be changed to a gaseous form at moderately higher temperature of 57Â Â°C (134Â Â°F). The uranium hexafluoride conversion product contains only natural, not enriched, uranium.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triuranium_octaoxide" title="Triuranium octaoxide">Triuranium octaoxide</a> (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) is also converted directly to <a href="/wiki/Ceramic" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a> grade <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> (UO<sub>2</sub>) for use in reactors not requiring enriched fuel, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CANDU" title="CANDU">CANDU</a>. The volumes of material converted directly to UO<sub>2</sub> are typically quite small compared to the amounts converted to UF<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">Enriched uranium</a></div>

<p>The concentration of the fissionable isotope, U-235 (0.71% in natural uranium) is less than that required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactor</a> cores. Natural UF<sub>6</sub> thus must be enriched in the fissionable isotope for it to be used as nuclear fuel. The different levels of enrichment required for a particular nuclear fuel application are specified by the customer: light-water reactor fuel normally is enriched to 3.5% U-235, but uranium enriched to lower concentrations is also required. Enrichment is accomplished using one or more methods of <a href="/wiki/Isotope_separation" title="Isotope separation">isotope separation</a>. <a href="/wiki/Gaseous_diffusion" title="Gaseous diffusion">Gaseous diffusion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gas_centrifuge" title="Gas centrifuge">gas centrifuge</a> are the commonly used uranium enrichment technologies, but new enrichment technologies are currently being developed.</p>

<p>For use as nuclear fuel, enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted into <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> (UO<sub>2</sub>) powder that is then processed into pellet form. The pellets are then fired in a high temperature <a href="/wiki/Sintering" title="Sintering">sintering</a> <a href="/wiki/Furnace" title="Furnace">furnace</a> to create hard, <a href="/wiki/Ceramic" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a> pellets of <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">enriched uranium</a>. The cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size. The pellets are stacked, according to each <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_core" title="Nuclear reactor core">nuclear reactor core</a>'s design specifications, into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloy</a>. The tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor.</p>
<p>The alloy used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor. <a href="/wiki/Stainless_steel" title="Stainless steel">Stainless steel</a> was used in the past, but most reactors now use a <a href="/wiki/Zirconium_alloy" title="Zirconium alloy">zirconium alloy</a>.

These bundles are then given a unique identification number, which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_of_radioactive_materials">Transport of radioactive materials</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">Transport</a> is an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle. There are nuclear power reactors in operation in several countries but uranium mining is viable in only a few areas. Also, in the course of over forty years of operation by the nuclear industry, a number of specialized facilities have been developed in various locations around the world to provide fuel cycle services and there is a need to transport nuclear materials to and from these facilities. Most transports of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuel</a> material occur between different stages of the cycle, but occasionally a material may be transported between similar facilities. With some exceptions, nuclear fuel cycle materials are transported in solid form, the exception being <a href="/wiki/Uranium_hexafluoride" title="Uranium hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> (UF<sub>6</sub>) which is considered a gas. Most of the material used in nuclear fuel is transported several times during the cycle. Transports are frequently international, and are often over large distances. Nuclear materials are generally transported by specialized transport companies.</p>
<p>Since nuclear materials are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactive" title="Radioactive">radioactive</a>, it is important to ensure that radiation exposure of both those involved in the transport of such materials and the general public along transport routes is limited. Packaging for nuclear materials includes, where appropriate, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radiation_shielding" title="Radiation shielding">shielding</a> to reduce potential radiation exposures. In the case of some materials, such as fresh uranium fuel assemblies, the radiation levels are negligible and no shielding is required. Other materials, such as spent fuel and high-level waste, are highly radioactive and require special handling. To limit the risk in transporting highly radioactive materials, containers known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel_shipping_cask" title="Spent nuclear fuel shipping cask">spent nuclear fuel shipping casks</a> are used which are designed to maintain integrity under normal transportation conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In-core_fuel_management">In-core fuel management</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_core" title="Nuclear reactor core">nuclear reactor core</a> is composed of a few hundred "assemblies", arranged in a regular array of cells, each cell being formed by a fuel or control rod surrounded, in most designs, by a <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">moderator</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coolant" title="Coolant">coolant</a>, which is water in most reactors.</p>
<p>Because of the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission" title="Nuclear fission">fission</a> process that consumes the fuels, the old fuel rods must be changed periodically to fresh ones (this period is called a cycle). However, only a part of the assemblies (typically one-third) are removed since the fuel depletion is not spatially uniform. Furthermore, it is not a good policy, for efficiency reasons, to put the new assemblies exactly at the location of the removed ones. Even bundles of the same age may have different burn-up levels, which depends on their previous positions in the core. Thus the available bundles must be arranged in such a way that the yield is maximized, while safety limitations and operational constraints are satisfied. Consequently, reactor operators are faced with the so-called <b>optimal fuel reloading problem</b>, which consists in optimizing the rearrangement of all the assemblies, the old and fresh ones, while still maximizing the reactivity of the reactor core so as to maximise fuel burn-up and minimise fuel-cycle costs.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="/wiki/Discrete_optimization" title="Discrete optimization">discrete optimization</a> problem, and computationally infeasible by current <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Combinatorial" title="Combinatorial">combinatorial</a> methods, due to the huge number of <a href="/wiki/Permutation" title="Permutation">permutations</a> and the complexity of each computation. Many <a href="/wiki/Numerical_method" title="Numerical method">numerical methods</a> have been proposed for solving it and many commercial <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> packages have been written to support fuel management. This is an ongoing issue in reactor operations as no definitive solution to this problem has been found. Operators use a combination of <a href="/wiki/Computation" title="Computation">computational</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empirical" title="Empirical">empirical</a> techniques to manage this problem.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_study_of_used_fuel">The study of used fuel</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_irradiation_examination" title="Post irradiation examination">Post irradiation examination</a></div>
<p>Used nuclear fuel is studied in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_irradiation_examination" title="Post irradiation examination">Post irradiation examination</a>, where used fuel is examined to know more about the processes that occur in fuel during use, and how these might alter the outcome of an accident. For example, during normal use, the fuel expands due to thermal expansion, which can cause cracking. Most <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuel</a> is uranium dioxide, which is a <a href="/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system" title="Cubic crystal system">cubic</a> solid with a structure similar to that of <a href="/wiki/Calcium_fluoride" title="Calcium fluoride">calcium fluoride</a>. In used fuel the solid state structure of most of the solid remains the same as that of pure cubic uranium dioxide. SIMFUEL is the name given to the simulated spent fuel which is made by mixing finely ground metal oxides, grinding as a slurry, spray drying it before heating in hydrogen/argon to 1700 C. In SIMFUEL, 4.1% of the volume of the solid was in the form of metal <a href="/wiki/Nanoparticle" title="Nanoparticle">nanoparticles</a> which are made of <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium" title="Ruthenium">ruthenium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhodium" title="Rhodium">rhodium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Palladium" title="Palladium">palladium</a>. Most of these metal particles are of the Îµ phase (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hexagonal_crystal_system" title="Hexagonal crystal system">hexagonal</a>) of Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd alloy, while smaller amounts of the Î± (<a href="/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system" title="Cubic crystal system">cubic</a>) and Ïƒ (<a href="/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system" title="Tetragonal crystal system">tetragonal</a>) phases of these metals were found in the SIMFUEL. Also present within the SIMFUEL was a cubic <a href="/wiki/Perovskite" title="Perovskite">perovskite</a> phase which is a <a href="/wiki/Barium" title="Barium">barium</a> <a href="/wiki/Strontium" title="Strontium">strontium</a> <a href="/wiki/Zirconium" title="Zirconium">zirconate</a> (Ba<sub>x</sub>Sr<sub>1-x</sub>ZrO<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p>Uranium dioxide is very insoluble in water, but after oxidation it can be converted to uranium trioxide or another uranium(VI) compound which is much more soluble. Uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) can be oxidised to an oxygen rich hyperstoichiometric oxide (UO<sub>2+x</sub>) which can be further oxidised to U<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and UO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p>Because used fuel contains alpha emitters (plutonium and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minor_actinides" title="Minor actinides">minor actinides</a>), the effect of adding an alpha emitter (Pu) to uranium dioxide on the leaching rate of the oxide has been investigated. For the crushed oxide, adding Pu tended to increase the rate of leaching, but the difference in the leaching rate between 0.1 and 10% Pu was very small.</p>
<p>The concentration of <a href="/wiki/Carbonate" title="Carbonate">carbonate</a> in the water which is in contact with the used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion, because <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>(VI) forms soluble anionic carbonate complexes such as [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] and [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]. When carbonate ions are absent, and the water is not strongly acidic, the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> often form insoluble hydrated <a href="/wiki/Uranium_trioxide" title="Uranium trioxide">uranium trioxide</a> phases.</p>
<p>By â€˜<a href="/wiki/Sputtering" title="Sputtering">sputtering</a>â€™, using uranium metal and an <a href="/wiki/Argon" title="Argon">argon</a>/<a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> gas mixture, thin films of uranium dioxide can be deposited upon gold surfaces. These gold surfaces modified with uranium dioxide have been used for both <a href="/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry" title="Cyclic voltammetry">cyclic voltammetry</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=AC_impedance&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="AC impedance (page does not exist)">AC impedance</a> experiments, and these offer an insight into the likely leaching behaviour of uranium dioxide.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fuel_cladding_interactions">Fuel cladding interactions</span></h4>
<p>The study of the nuclear fuel cycle includes the study of the behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions. For example, there has been much work on how <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> based fuel interacts with the <a href="/wiki/Zirconium" title="Zirconium">zirconium</a> alloy tubing used to cover it. During use, the fuel swells due to <a href="/wiki/Thermal_expansion" title="Thermal expansion">thermal expansion</a> and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy, forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium (from the cladding). Then, on the fuel side of this mixed layer, there is a layer of fuel which has a higher <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> to <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> ratio than most of the fuel. This is because <a href="/wiki/Xenon" title="Xenon">xenon</a> isotopes are formed as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a> that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding. After diffusing into these voids, it decays to caesium isotopes. Because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use, the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area. Below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal, uranium nitride and <a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> as a function of distance from the centre of a 20Â mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 C. The uranium dioxide (because of its poor thermal conductivity) will overheat at the centre of the pellet, while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points.</p>
<div class="center">

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Normal_and_abnormal_conditions">Normal and abnormal conditions</span></h4>
<p>The nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas; one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (<i>more rarely</i>) an accident is occurring.</p>
<p>The releases of radioactivity from normal operations are the small planned releases from uranium ore processing, enrichment, power reactors, reprocessing plants and waste stores. These can be in a different chemical/physical form to the releases which could occur under accident conditions. In addition the isotope signature of a hypothetical accident may be very different from that of a planned normal operational discharge of radioactivity to the environment.</p>
<p>Just because a radioisotope is released it does not mean it will enter a human and then cause harm. For instance, the migration of radioactivity can be altered by the binding of the radioisotope to the surfaces of soil particles. For example, <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> (Cs) binds tightly to clay minerals such as <a href="/wiki/Illite" title="Illite">illite</a> and <a href="/wiki/Montmorillonite" title="Montmorillonite">montmorillonite</a>, hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass). Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of Cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain. But Cs is not able to migrate quickly through most soils and thus is unlikely to contaminate <a href="/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">well</a> water. Colloids of soil minerals can migrate through soil so simple binding of a metal to the surfaces of soil particles does not fix the metal totally.</p>
<p>According to JiÅ™Ã­ HÃ¡la's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Text_book" title="Text book">text book</a>, the distribution coefficient K<sub>d</sub> is the ratio of the soil's radioactivity (Bq g) to that of the soil water (Bq ml). If the radioisotope is tightly bound to the minerals in the soil, then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grass</a> growing on the soil.</p>

<p>One of the best countermeasures in dairy farming against Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long-term gamma dose to humans due to Cs, as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.</p>
<p>Even after the radioactive element arrives at the roots of the plant, the metal may be rejected by the biochemistry of the plant.

The caesium was found in the leaf veins, in the stem and in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apical_meristem" title="Apical meristem">apical</a> leaves. It was found that 12% of the caesium entered the plant, and 20% of the strontium.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> farming, an important countermeasure against Cs is to feed animals a small amount of <a href="/wiki/Prussian_blue" title="Prussian blue">Prussian blue</a>.

The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of Prussian blue per day. The Prussian blue reduces the <a href="/wiki/Biological_half-life" title="Biological half-life">biological half-life</a> (different from the <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">nuclear half-life</a>) of the caesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of Cs is about 30 years. This is a constant which can not be changed but the biological half-life is not a constant. It will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed. Caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the Prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the <a href="/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">droppings</a> is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled. The form of Prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade.

<p>The IAEA assume that under normal operation the coolant of a water-cooled reactor will contain some radioactivity but during a reactor accident the coolant radioactivity level may rise. The IAEA states that under a series of different conditions different amounts of the core inventory can be released from the fuel, the four conditions the IAEA consider are <i>normal operation</i>, a spike in coolant activity due to a sudden shutdown/loss of pressure (core remains covered with water), a cladding failure resulting in the release of the activity in the fuel/cladding gap (this could be due to the fuel being uncovered by the loss of water for 15â€“30 minutes where the cladding reached a temperature of 650-1250 C) or a melting of the core (the fuel will have to be uncovered for at least 30 minutes, and the cladding would reach a temperature in excess of 1650 C).</p>
<p>Based upon the assumption that a Pressurized water reactor contains 300 tons of <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, and that the activity of the fuel of a 1 GWe reactor is as the IAEA predicts, then the coolant activity after an accident such as the <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Three Mile Island accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> (where a core is uncovered and then recovered with water) can be predicted.</p>

<p>Some reactor designs, such as <a href="/wiki/RBMK" title="RBMK">RBMKs</a> or <a href="/wiki/CANDU_reactor" title="CANDU reactor">CANDU reactors</a>, can be refueled without being shut down.

Each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine, typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in CANDU reactors. On-load refueling allows for the <b>optimal fuel reloading problem</b> to be dealt with continuously, leading to more efficient use of fuel. This increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of pressure tubes and the fueling machines to service them.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interim_storage">Interim storage</span></h3>
<p>After its operating cycle, the reactor is shut down for refueling. The fuel discharged at that time (spent fuel) is stored either at the reactor site (commonly in a <a href="/wiki/Spent_fuel_pool" title="Spent fuel pool">spent fuel pool</a>) or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites. If on-site pool storage capacity is exceeded, it may be desirable to store the now cooled aged fuel in modular dry storage facilities known as Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) at the reactor site or at a facility away from the site. The spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid, which provides both cooling (the spent fuel continues to generate <a href="/wiki/Decay_heat" title="Decay heat">decay heat</a> as a result of residual radioactive decay) and shielding to protect the environment from residual <a href="/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" title="Ionizing radiation">ionizing radiation</a>, although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to <a href="/wiki/Dry_cask_storage" title="Dry cask storage">dry cask storage</a>.</p>

<p>A current concern in the nuclear power field is the safe disposal and isolation of either <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent fuel from reactors</a> or, if the reprocessing option is used, wastes from reprocessing plants. These materials must be isolated from the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> until the radioactivity contained in them has diminished to a safe level. In the U.S., under the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act" title="Nuclear Waste Policy Act">Nuclear Waste Policy Act</a> of 1982 as amended, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">Department of Energy</a> has responsibility for the development of the waste disposal system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.

The Department of Energy chose <a href="/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository" title="Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository">Yucca Mountain</a> as the location for the repository.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_actinides_recycling">Minor actinides recycling</span></h3>
<p>It has been proposed that in addition to the use of plutonium, the <a href="/wiki/Minor_actinide" title="Minor actinide">minor actinides</a> could be used in a critical power reactor. Tests are already being conducted in which <a href="/wiki/Americium" title="Americium">americium</a> is being used as a fuel.</p>
<p>A number of reactor designs, like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">Integral Fast Reactor</a>, have been designed for this rather different fuel cycle. In principle, it should be possible to derive energy from the fission of any actinide nucleus. With a careful reactor design, all the actinides in the fuel can be consumed, leaving only lighter elements with short <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-lives</a>. Whereas this has been done in prototype plants, no such reactor has ever been operated on a large scale, and the first plants with full actinide recovery are expected to be ready for commercial deployment in 2015 at the earliest.</p>
<p>It so happens that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neutron_cross-section" title="Neutron cross-section">neutron cross-section</a> of many actinides decreases with increasing neutron energy, but the ratio of fission to simple activation (<a href="/wiki/Neutron_capture" title="Neutron capture">neutron capture</a>) changes in favour of fission as the neutron energy increases. Thus with a sufficiently high neutron energy, it should be possible to destroy even curium without the generation of the transcurium metals. This could be very desirable as it would make it significantly easier to reprocess and handle the actinide fuel.</p>
<p>One promising alternative from this perspective is an <a href="/wiki/Accelerator-driven_sub-critical_reactor" title="Accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor">accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor</a> / <a href="/wiki/Subcritical_reactor" title="Subcritical reactor">subcritical reactor</a>. Here a beam of either <a href="/wiki/Proton" title="Proton">protons</a> (United States and European designs) or <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a> (Japanese design) is directed into a target. In the case of protons, very fast neutrons will spall off the target, while in the case of the electrons, very high energy <a href="/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> will be generated. These high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides.</p>
<p>Such reactors compare very well to other neutron sources in terms of neutron energy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal 0 to 100Â eV</li>
<li>Epithermal 100Â eV to 100Â keV</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fuel_or_targets_for_this_actinide_transmutation">Fuel or targets for this actinide transmutation</span></h4>
<p>To date the nature of the fuel (targets) for actinide transformation has not been chosen.</p>
<p>If actinides are transmuted in a <a href="/wiki/Subcritical_reactor" title="Subcritical reactor">Subcritical reactor</a> it is likely that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel. An accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor, and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if actinides are destroyed using a fast reactor, such as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">Integral Fast Reactor</a>, then the fuel will most likely not be exposed to many more thermal cycles than in a normal power station.</p>
<p>Depending on the matrix the process can generate more transuranics from the matrix. This could either be viewed as good (generate more fuel) or can be viewed as bad (generation of more <i>radiotoxic</i> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic_element" title="Transuranic element">transuranic elements</a>). A series of different matrices exists which can control this production of heavy actinides.</p>
<p>Fissile nuclei, like Uranium-235, Plutonium-239 and Uranium-233 respond well to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Delayed_neutrons" title="Delayed neutrons">delayed neutrons</a> and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable, and this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor. As a consequence it is important that the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that doesn't produce additional long-lived isotopes.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Actinides_in_an_inert_matrix">Actinides in an inert matrix</span></h5>
<p>The actinides will be mixed with a metal which will not form more actinides, for instance an <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloy</a> of actinides in a solid such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zirconia" title="Zirconia">zirconia</a> could be used.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Actinides_in_a_thorium_matrix">Actinides in a thorium matrix</span></h5>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">Thorium</a> will on neutron bombardment form <a href="/wiki/Uranium-233" title="Uranium-233">uranium-233</a>. U-233 is fissile, and has a larger fission cross section than both U-235 and U-238, and thus it is far less likely to produce higher actinides through neutron capture.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Actinides_in_a_uranium_matrix">Actinides in a uranium matrix</span></h5>
<p>If the actinides are incorporated into a uranium-metal or uranium-oxide matrix, then the neutron capture of U-238 is likely to generate new <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>. An advantage of mixing the actinides with uranium and plutonium is that the large fission cross sections of U-235 and Pu-239 for the less energetic <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Delayed-neutrons&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Delayed-neutrons (page does not exist)">delayed-neutrons</a> could make the reaction stable enough to be carried out in a critical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_reactor" title="Fast reactor">fast reactor</a>, which is likely to be both cheaper and simpler than an accelerator driven system.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Mixed_matrix">Mixed matrix</span></h5>
<p>It is also possible to create a matrix made from a mix of the above-mentioned materials. This is most commonly done in fast reactors where one may wish to keep the breeding ratio of new fuel high enough to keep powering the reactor, but still low enough that the generated actinides can be safely destroyed without transporting them to another site. One way to do this is to use fuel where actinides and uranium is mixed with inert zirconium, producing fuel elements with the desired properties.</p>

Protactinium-233 in turn decays with a half-life of 27 days to U-233. In some <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">molten salt reactor</a> designs, the Pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons (which could transform it to Pa-234 and then to <a href="/wiki/Uranium-234" title="Uranium-234">U-234</a>), until it has decayed to U-233. This is done in order to improve the <a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor#Breeding_ratio" title="Breeder reactor">breeding ratio</a> which is low compared to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_reactor" title="Fast reactor">fast reactors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">Thorium</a> is at least 4-5 times more abundant in nature than all of uranium isotopes combined; thorium is fairly evenly spread around Earth with a lot of countries having huge supplies of it; preparation of thorium fuel does not require difficult  and expensive enrichment processes; the thorium fuel cycle creates mainly Uranium-233 contaminated with <a href="/wiki/Uranium-232" title="Uranium-232">Uranium-232</a> which makes it harder to use in a normal, pre-assembled nuclear weapon which is stable over long periods of time (unfortunately drawbacks are much lower for immediate use weapons or where final assembly occurs just prior to usage time); elimination of at least the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic" title="Transuranic">transuranic</a> portion of the nuclear waste problem is possible in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molten-salt_reactor" title="Molten-salt reactor">MSR</a> and other breeder reactor designs.</p>
<p>One of the earliest efforts to use a thorium fuel cycle took place at <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in the 1960s. An experimental reactor was built based on <a href="/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" title="Molten salt reactor">molten salt reactor</a> technology to study the feasibility of such an approach, using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thorium_fluoride" title="Thorium fluoride">thorium fluoride</a> <a href="/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)" title="Salt (chemistry)">salt</a> kept hot enough to be liquid, thus eliminating the need for fabricating fuel elements. This effort culminated in the <a href="/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment" title="Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment">Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment</a> that used Th as the fertile material and U as the fissile fuel. Due to a lack of funding, the MSR program was discontinued in 1976.</p>

<p>Currently the only isotopes used as nuclear fuel are <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">uranium-235</a> (U-235), <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">uranium-238</a> (U-238) and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, although the proposed thorium fuel cycle has advantages. Some modern reactors, with minor modifications, can use <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>. Thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the <a href="/wiki/Crust_(geology)" title="Crust (geology)">Earth's crust</a> than uranium (and 550 times more abundant than uranium-235). However, there has been little exploration for thorium resources, and thus the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Proved_resource&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Proved resource (page does not exist)">proved resource</a> is small. <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">Thorium</a> is more plentiful than <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> in some countries, notably <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heavy_water_reactor" title="Heavy water reactor">Heavy water reactors</a> and graphite-moderated reactors can use <a href="/wiki/Natural_uranium" title="Natural uranium">natural uranium</a>, but the vast majority of the world's reactors require <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">enriched uranium</a>, in which the ratio of U-235 to U-238 is increased. In civilian reactors the enrichment is increased to as much as 5% U-235 and 95% U-238, but in <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion" title="Nuclear marine propulsion">naval reactors</a> there is as much as 93% U-235.</p>
