<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definitions">Definitions</span></h2>
<p>Energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the <i>twin pillars</i> of sustainable energy. Some ways in which <i>sustainable energy</i> has been defined are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Effectively, the provision of energy such that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. ...Sustainable Energy has two key components: renewable energy and energy efficiency." – <i>Renewable Energy and Efficiency Partnership</i> (British)</li>
<li>"Dynamic harmony between equitable availability of energy-intensive goods and services to all people and the preservation of the earth for future generations." And, "The solution will lie in finding sustainable energy sources and more efficient means of converting and utilizing energy." – <i>Sustainable Energy</i> by J. W. Tester, <i>et al.</i>, from MIT Press.</li>
<li>"Any energy generation, efficiency and conservation source where: Resources are available to enable massive scaling to become a significant portion of energy generation, long term, preferably 100 years.." – <i>Invest,</i> a green technology non-profit organization.</li>
<li>"Energy which is replenishable within a human lifetime and causes no long-term damage to the environment." – <i>Jamaica Sustainable Development Network</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This sets <i>sustainable energy</i> apart from other <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> terminology such as <i><a href="/wiki/Alternative_energy" title="Alternative energy">alternative energy</a></i> by focusing on the ability of an energy source to continue providing energy. Sustainable energy can produce some pollution of the environment, as long as it is not sufficient to prohibit heavy use of the source for an indefinite amount of time. Sustainable energy is also distinct from <a href="/wiki/Low-carbon_economy" title="Low-carbon economy">low-carbon energy</a>, which is sustainable only in the sense that it does not add to the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Green Energy is energy that can be extracted, generated, and/or consumed without any significant negative impact to the environment. The planet has a natural capability to recover which means pollution that does not go beyond that capability can still be termed green.</p>
<p>Green power is a subset of renewable energy and represents those renewable energy resources and technologies that provide the highest environmental benefit. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> defines green power as electricity produced from solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact small hydroelectric sources. Customers often buy green power for avoided environmental impacts and its <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a> reduction benefits.</p>

<p>First- and second-generation technologies have entered the markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.</p>
<p>Regarding energy used by vehicles, a comprehensive 2008 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> review was conducted of sustainable energy sources and usage combinations in the context of global warming and other dominating issues; it ranked <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> generation combined with <a href="/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle" title="Battery electric vehicle">battery electric vehicles</a> (BEV) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel_cell_vehicles" title="Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles">hydrogen fuel cell vehicles</a> (HFCVs) as the most efficient.

<p>Among sources of renewable energy, hydroelectric plants have the advantages of being long-lived—many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Also, hydroelectric plants are clean and have few emissions. Criticisms directed at large-scale hydroelectric plants include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, and release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide during construction and flooding of the reservoir.</p>

<p>However, it has been found that high emissions are associated only with shallow reservoirs in warm (tropical) locales, and recent innovations in hydropower turbine technology are enabling efficient development of low-impact <a href="/wiki/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity" title="Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity">run-of-the-river hydroelectricity</a> projects. Generally speaking, hydroelectric plants produce much lower life-cycle emissions than other types of generation. Hydroelectric power, which underwent extensive development during growth of electrification in the 19th and 20th centuries, is experiencing resurgence of development in the 21st century. The areas of greatest hydroelectric growth are the booming economies of Asia. China is the development leader; however, other Asian nations are installing hydropower at a rapid pace. This growth is driven by much increased energy costs—especially for imported energy—and widespread desires for more domestically produced, clean, renewable, and economical generation.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">Geothermal power</a> plants can operate 24 hours per day, providing base-load capacity, and the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation is estimated at 85 GW over the next 30 years. However, geothermal power is accessible only in limited areas of the world, including the <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_energy_in_the_United_States" title="Geothermal energy in the United States">United States</a>, Central America, East Africa, <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_Iceland" title="Geothermal power in Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_Indonesia" title="Geothermal power in Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_the_Philippines" title="Geothermal power in the Philippines">Philippines</a>. The costs of geothermal energy have dropped substantially from the systems built in the 1970s. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geothermal_heat" title="Geothermal heat">Geothermal heat</a> generation can be competitive in many countries producing geothermal power, or in other regions where the resource is of a lower temperature. <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_geothermal_system" title="Enhanced geothermal system">Enhanced geothermal system</a> (EGS) technology does not require natural convective hydrothermal resources, so it can be used in areas that were previously unsuitable for geothermal power, if the resource is very large. EGS is currently under research at the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biomass_briquettes" title="Biomass briquettes">Biomass briquettes</a> are increasingly being used in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal. The technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70% the calorific value of charcoal. There are relatively few examples of large-scale briquette production. One exception is in <a href="/wiki/North_Kivu" title="North Kivu">North Kivu</a>, in eastern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to mountain gorilla habitat.

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Markets for second-generation technologies are strong and growing, but only in a few countries. The challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_heating" title="Solar heating">Solar heating</a> systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pool water, or for space heating. The heat can also be used for industrial applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment. In many climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy. Energy received from the sun by the earth is that of electromagnetic radiation. Light ranges of visible, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and radio waves received by the earth through solar energy. The highest power of radiation comes from visible light. Solar power is complicated due to changes in seasons and from day to night. Cloud cover can also add to complications of solar energy, and not all radiation from the sun reaches earth because it is absorbed and dispersed due to clouds and gases within the earth's atmospheres.</p>

<p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules provided <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Remote-area_power_supply" title="Remote-area power supply">remote-area power supply</a>, but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Building_integrated_photovoltaics" title="Building integrated photovoltaics">building integrated photovoltaics</a> and power plants for grid connected applications (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_stations" title="Photovoltaic power stations">photovoltaic power stations</a> article for details). Currently the largest photovoltaic power plant in North America is the <a href="/wiki/Nellis_Solar_Power_Plant" title="Nellis Solar Power Plant">Nellis Solar Power Plant</a> (15 MW). There is a proposal to build a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_power_station_in_Victoria" title="Solar power station in Victoria">Solar power station in Victoria</a>, Australia, which would be the world's largest PV power station, at 154 MW. Other large photovoltaic power stations include the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Girassol_solar_power_plant" title="Girassol solar power plant">Girassol solar power plant</a> (62 MW), and the <a href="/wiki/Waldpolenz_Solar_Park" title="Waldpolenz Solar Park">Waldpolenz Solar Park</a> (40 MW).</p>

<p>Some of the second-generation renewables, such as wind power, have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs. At the end of 2008, worldwide <a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">wind farm</a> capacity was 120,791 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatts" title="Megawatts">megawatts</a> (MW), representing an increase of 28.8 percent during the year, and <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> produced some 1.3% of global electricity consumption. Wind power accounts for approximately 20% of electricity use in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark" title="Wind power in Denmark">Denmark</a>, 9% in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Spain" title="Wind power in Spain">Spain</a>, and 7% in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Germany" title="Wind power in Germany">Germany</a>. However, it may be difficult to site wind turbines in some areas for aesthetic or environmental reasons, and it may be difficult to integrate wind power into electricity grids in some cases.</p>
<p>Solar thermal power stations have been successfully operating in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> commercially since the late 1980s, including the largest solar power plant of any kind, the 350 MW <a href="/wiki/Solar_Energy_Generating_Systems" title="Solar Energy Generating Systems">Solar Energy Generating Systems</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nevada_Solar_One" title="Nevada Solar One">Nevada Solar One</a> is another 64MW plant which has recently opened. Other parabolic trough power plants being proposed are two 50MW plants in <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and a 100MW plant in <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">ethanol fuel</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sugar_cane" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this, together with the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which years ago had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in oil.</p>
<p>Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DaimlerChrysler" title="DaimlerChrysler">DaimlerChrysler</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation" title="General Motors Corporation">GM</a> are among the automobile companies that sell "flexible-fuel" cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85).

<p>Bio-fuels may be defined as "renewable," yet may not be "sustainable," due to soil degradation. As of 2012, 40% of American corn production goes toward ethanol. Ethanol takes up a large percentage of "Clean Energy Use" when in fact, it is still debatable whether ethanol should be considered as a "Clean Energy."</p>
<p>According to the International Energy Agency, new bioenergy (biofuel) technologies being developed today, notably cellulosic ethanol biorefineries, could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste and <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a> are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated <a href="/wiki/Energy_crop" title="Energy crop">energy crops</a>, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainably produced</a> in many regions of the United States.</p>

The farm will initially use three <a href="/wiki/Pelamis_Wave_Energy_Converter" title="Pelamis Wave Energy Converter">Pelamis P-750</a> machines generating 2.25 MW. and costs are put at 8.5 million <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a>. Subject to successful operation, a further 70 million euro is likely to be invested before 2009 on a further 28 machines to generate 525 MW. Funding for a wave farm in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> was announced in February, 2007 by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_Executive" title="Scottish Executive">Scottish Executive</a>, at a cost of over 4 million <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">pounds</a>, as part of a £13 million funding packages for <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Scotland#Wave_power" title="Renewable energy in Scotland">ocean power in Scotland</a>.

<p>Solar power panels that use <a href="/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, which can create circuits out of individual silicon molecules, may cost half as much as traditional photovoltaic cells, according to executives and investors involved in developing the products. <a href="/wiki/Nanosolar" title="Nanosolar">Nanosolar</a> has secured more than $100 million from investors to build a factory for nanotechnology thin-film solar panels. The company's plant has a planned production capacity of 430 megawatts peak power of solar cells per year.

<p>Most current solar power plants are made from an array of similar units where each unit is continuously adjusted, e.g., with some step motors, so that the light converter stays in focus of the sun light. The cost of focusing light on converters such as high-power solar panels, <a href="/wiki/Stirling_engine" title="Stirling engine">Stirling engine</a>, etc. can be dramatically decreased with a simple and efficient rope mechanics. In this technique many units are connected with a network of ropes so that pulling two or three ropes is sufficient to keep all light converters simultaneously in focus as the direction of the sun changes.</p>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_pumps" title="Heat pumps">Heat pumps</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage" title="Thermal energy storage">Thermal energy storage</a> are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).</p>
<p>Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to <a href="/wiki/Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage" title="Seasonal thermal energy storage">interseasonal</a>, and can involve storage of <a href="/wiki/Sensible_heat" title="Sensible heat">sensible energy</a> (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latent_energy" title="Latent energy">latent energy</a> (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The <a href="/wiki/Drake_Landing_Solar_Community" title="Drake Landing Solar Community">Drake Landing Solar Community</a> (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. <a href="/wiki/Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage" title="Seasonal thermal energy storage">borehole thermal energy storage</a> allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer. Types of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks, borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock, deep aquifers, or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top. Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_pumps" title="Heat pumps">heat pump</a>. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called <a href="/wiki/Phase-change_material" title="Phase-change material">phase-change materials</a> (PCMs).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_efficiency">Energy efficiency</span></h2>
<p>Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.</p>
<p>Renewable energy and <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> are sometimes said to be the "twin pillars" of sustainable energy policy. Both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. A recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">energy efficiency</a> improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand, which is due to continuing economic and <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a>. As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase. Thus, given the thermodynamic and practical limits of energy efficiency improvements, slowing the growth in energy demand is essential. However, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.</p>
<p>Renewable energy (and energy efficiency) are no longer niche sectors that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increased levels of investment and the fact that much of the capital is coming from more conventional financial actors suggest that sustainable energy options are now becoming mainstream. An example of this would be The <a href="/wiki/Alliance_to_Save_Energy" title="Alliance to Save Energy">Alliance to Save Energy</a>'s Project with Stahl Consolidated Manufacturing, (Huntsville, Alabama, USA) (StahlCon 7), a patented generator shaft designed to reduce emissions within existing power generating systems, granted publishing rights to the Alliance in 2007.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">Climate change</a> concerns coupled with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_price_increases_since_2003" title="Oil price increases since 2003">high oil prices</a> and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the sustainable energy industries, according to a trend analysis from the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" title="United Nations Environment Programme">United Nations Environment Programme</a>. According to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UNEP" title="UNEP">UNEP</a>, global investment in sustainable energy in 2007 was higher than previous levels, with $148 billion of new money raised in 2007, an increase of 60% over 2006. Total financial transactions in sustainable energy, including acquisition activity, was $204 billion.</p>
<p>Investment flows in 2007 broadened and diversified, making the overall picture one of greater breadth and depth of sustainable energy use. The mainstream capital markets are "now fully receptive to sustainable energy companies, supported by a surge in funds destined for clean energy investment".</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Smart_grid" title="Smart grid">Smart grid</a></div>
<p>Smart grid refers to a class of technology people are using to bring utility electricity delivery systems into the 21st century, using computer-based remote control and automation. These systems are made possible by two-way communication technology and computer processing that has been used for decades in other industries. They are beginning to be used on electricity networks, from the power plants and wind farms all the way to the consumers of electricity in homes and businesses. They offer many benefits to utilities and consumers—mostly seen in big improvements in energy efficiency on the electricity grid and in the energy users’ homes and offices.</p>

<p>Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution. Green power is electricity generated from <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources.</p>

Some definitions may also include power derived from the <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incineration</a> of waste.</p>
<p>Some people, including <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> founder and first member <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Moore_(environmentalist)" title="Patrick Moore (environmentalist)">Patrick Moore</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Monbiot" title="George Monbiot">George Monbiot</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gates" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Lovelock" title="James Lovelock">James Lovelock</a> have specifically classified <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> as green energy. Others, including <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Phil_Radford" title="Phil Radford">Phil Radford</a> disagree, claiming that the problems associated with <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_waste" title="Radioactive waste">radioactive waste</a> and the risk of nuclear accidents (such as the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>) pose an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity. However, newer nuclear reactor designs are capable of utilizing what is now deemed "nuclear waste" until it is no longer (or dramatically less) dangerous, and have design features that greatly minimize the possibility of a nuclear accident. These designs have yet to be proven. (See: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">Integral Fast Reactor</a>)</p>
<p>Some have argued that although green energy is a commendable effort in solving the world's increasing energy consumption, it must be accompanied by a cultural change that encourages the decrease of the world's appetite for energy.</p>
<p>In several <a href="/wiki/Nation" title="Nation">countries</a> with <a href="/wiki/Common_carrier" title="Common carrier">common carrier</a> arrangements, <a href="/wiki/Electricity_retailing" title="Electricity retailing">electricity retailing</a> arrangements make it possible for consumers to purchase green electricity (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_electricity" title="Renewable electricity">renewable electricity</a>) from either their utility or a green power provider.</p>
<p>When energy is purchased from the electricity network, the power reaching the consumer will not necessarily be generated from green energy sources. The local <a href="/wiki/Public_utility" title="Public utility">utility company</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_power_industry" title="Electrical power industry">electric company</a>, or state power pool buys their electricity from <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity producers</a> who may be generating from <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear</a> or renewable energy sources. In many countries green energy currently provides a very small amount of electricity, generally contributing less than 2 to 5% to the overall pool. In some U.S. states, local governments have formed regional power purchasing pools using <a href="/wiki/Community_Choice_Aggregation" title="Community Choice Aggregation">Community Choice Aggregation</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Solar_Bonds&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Solar Bonds (page does not exist)">Solar Bonds</a> to achieve a 51% renewable mix or higher, such as in the City of San Francisco.</p>
<p>By participating in a green energy program a consumer may be having an effect on the energy sources used and ultimately might be helping to promote and expand the use of green energy. They are also making a statement to policy makers that they are willing to pay a price premium to support renewable energy. Green energy consumers either obligate the utility companies to increase the amount of green energy that they purchase from the pool (so decreasing the amount of non-green energy they purchase), or directly fund the green energy through a green power provider. If insufficient green energy sources are available, the utility must develop new ones or <a href="/wiki/Contract" title="Contract">contract</a> with a third party energy supplier to provide green energy, causing more to be built. However, there is no way the consumer can check whether or not the electricity bought is "green" or otherwise.</p>
<p>In some countries such as the Netherlands, electricity companies guarantee to buy an equal amount of 'green power' as is being used by their green power customers. The <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> government exempts green power from pollution taxes, which means green power is hardly any more expensive than other power.</p>
<p>In the United States, one of the main problems with purchasing green energy through the electrical grid is the current centralized infrastructure that supplies the consumer’s electricity. This infrastructure has led to increasingly frequent brown outs and black outs, high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, higher energy costs, and power quality issues. An additional $450 billion will be invested to expand this fledgling system over the next 20 years to meet increasing demand. In addition, this centralized system is now being further overtaxed with the incorporation of renewable energies such as wind, solar, and geothermal energies. Renewable resources, due to the amount of space they require, are often located in remote areas where there is a lower energy demand. The current infrastructure would make transporting this energy to high demand areas, such as urban centers, highly inefficient and in some cases impossible. In addition, despite the amount of renewable energy produced or the economic viability of such technologies only about 20 percent will be able to be incorporated into the grid. To have a more sustainable energy profile, the United States must move towards implementing changes to the electrical grid that will accommodate a mixed-fuel economy.</p>
<p>However, several initiatives are being proposed to mitigate these distribution problems. First and foremost, the most effective way to reduce USA’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and slow global warming is through conservation efforts. Opponents of the current US electrical grid have also advocated for decentralizing the grid. This system would increase efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost in transmission. It would also be economically viable as it would reduce the amount of power lines that will need to be constructed in the future to keep up with demand. Merging heat and power in this system would create added benefits and help to increase its efficiency by up to 80-90%. This is a significant increase from the current fossil fuel plants which only have an efficiency of 34%.</p>
<p>A more recent concept for improving our electrical grid is to beam microwaves from Earth-orbiting satellites or the moon to directly when and where there is demand. The power would be generated from solar energy captured on the lunar surface In this system, the receivers would be "broad, translucent tent-like structures that would receive microwaves and convert them to electricity". NASA said in 2000 that the technology was worth pursuing but it is still too soon to say if the technology will be cost-effective.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> and several green electricity labelling organizations created the (now defunct) <a href="/wiki/Eugene_Green_Energy_Standard" title="Eugene Green Energy Standard">Eugene Green Energy Standard</a> under which the national green electricity certification schemes could be accredited to ensure that the purchase of green energy leads to the provision of additional new green energy resources.</p>

<p>Those not satisfied with the third-party grid approach to green energy via the power grid can install their own locally based renewable energy system. Renewable energy electrical systems from solar to wind to even local hydro-power in some cases, are some of the many types of renewable energy systems available locally. Additionally, for those interested in heating and cooling their dwelling via renewable energy, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geothermal_exchange_heat_pump" title="Geothermal exchange heat pump">geothermal heat pump</a> systems that tap the constant <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> of the earth, which is around 7 to 15 degrees <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> a few feet underground and increases dramatically at greater depths, are an option over conventional <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>-fueled heat approaches. Also, in geographic locations where the <a href="/wiki/Crust_(geology)" title="Crust (geology)">Earth's Crust</a> is especially thin, or near <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volcanoes" title="Volcanoes">volcanoes</a> (as is the case in <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>) there exists the potential to generate even more electricity than would be possible at other sites, thanks to a more significant <a href="/wiki/Temperature_gradient" title="Temperature gradient">temperature gradient</a> at these locales.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach in the United States is that many states offer incentives to offset the cost of installation of a renewable energy system. In California, Massachusetts and several other U.S. states, a new approach to community energy supply called <a href="/wiki/Community_Choice_Aggregation" title="Community Choice Aggregation">Community Choice Aggregation</a> has provided communities with the means to solicit a competitive electricity supplier and use municipal revenue bonds to finance development of local green energy resources. Individuals are usually assured that the electricity they are using is actually produced from a green energy source that they control. Once the system is paid for, the owner of a renewable energy system will be producing their own renewable electricity for essentially no cost and can sell the excess to the local utility at a profit.</p>

<p>Renewable energy, after its generation, needs to be stored in a medium for use with autonomous devices as well as vehicles. Also, to provide household electricity in remote areas (that is areas which are not connected to the <a href="/wiki/Mains_electricity" title="Mains electricity">mains electricity grid</a>), energy storage is required for use with renewable energy. Energy generation and consumption systems used in the latter case are usually <a href="/wiki/Stand-alone_power_system" title="Stand-alone power system">stand-alone power systems</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>energy carriers as <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen" title="Liquid nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Compressed_air" title="Compressed air">compressed air</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oxyhydrogen" title="Oxyhydrogen">oxyhydrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battery_(electricity)" title="Battery (electricity)">batteries</a>, to power vehicles.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage" title="Flywheel energy storage">flywheel energy storage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage hydroelectricity</a> is more usable in stationary applications (e.g. to power homes and offices). In household power systems, conversion of energy can also be done to reduce smell. For example, organic matter such as cow dung and spoilable organic matter can be converted to <a href="/wiki/Biochar" title="Biochar">biochar</a>. To eliminate emissions, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> is then used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually however, renewable energy is derived from the mains electricity grid. This means that energy storage is mostly not used, as the mains electricity grid is organised to produce the exact amount of energy being consumed at that particular moment. Energy production on the mains electricity grid is always set up as a combination of (large-scale) renewable energy plants, as well as other power plants as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil-fuel_power_plant" title="Fossil-fuel power plant">fossil-fuel power plants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>. This combination however, which is essential for this type of energy supply (as e.g. wind turbines, solar power plants etc.) can only produce when the wind blows and the sun shines. This is also one of the main drawbacks of the system as fossil fuel powerplants are polluting and are a main cause of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> (nuclear power being an exception). Although fossil fuel power plants too can be made emissionless (through carbon capture and storage), as well as renewable (if the plants are converted to e.g. biomass) the best solution is still to phase out the latter power plants over time. Nuclear power plants too can be more or less eliminated from their problem of nuclear waste through the use of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">nuclear reprocessing</a> and newer plants as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_breeder_reactor" title="Fast breeder reactor">fast breeder</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" title="Nuclear fusion">nuclear fusion</a> plants.</p>
<p>Renewable energy power plants do provide a steady flow of energy. For example, hydropower plants, ocean thermal plants, osmotic power plants all provide power at a regulated pace, and are thus available power sources at any given moment (even at night, windstill moments etc.). At present however, the number of steady-flow renewable energy plants alone is still too small to meet energy demands at the times of the day when the irregular producing renewable energy plants cannot produce power.</p>
<p>Besides the greening of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, another option is the distribution and immediate use of power from solely renewable sources. In this set-up energy storage is again not necessary. For example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trans-Mediterranean_Renewable_Energy_Cooperation" title="Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation">TREC</a> has proposed to distribute solar power from the Sahara to Europe. Europe can distribute wind and ocean power to the Sahara and other countries. In this way, power is produced at any given time as at any point of the planet as the sun or the wind is up or ocean waves and currents are stirring. This option however is probably not possible in the short-term, as fossil fuel and nuclear power are still the main sources of energy on the mains electricity net and replacing them will not be possible overnight.</p>
<p>Several <a href="/wiki/Grid_energy_storage" title="Grid energy storage">large-scale energy storage suggestions for the grid</a> have been done. Worldwide there is over 100 GW of <a href="/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">Pumped-storage hydroelectricity</a>. This improves efficiency and decreases energy losses but a conversion to an energy storing mains electricity grid is a very costly solution. Some costs could potentially be reduced by making use of energy storage equipment the consumer buys and not the state. An example is <a href="/wiki/Grid_energy_storage" title="Grid energy storage">batteries</a> in electric cars that would double as an energy buffer for the electricity grid. However besides the cost, setting-up such a system would still be a very complicated and difficult procedure. Also, energy storage apparatus' as car batteries are also built with materials that pose a threat to the environment (e.g. Lithium). The combined production of batteries for such a large part of the population would still have environmental concerns. Besides car batteries however, other <a href="/wiki/Grid_energy_storage" title="Grid energy storage">Grid energy storage</a> projects make use of less polluting energy carriers (e.g. compressed air tanks and flywheel energy storage).</p>

<p>The primary obstacle that is preventing the large scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology. Currently, photovoltaic (PV) panels only have the ability to convert around 16% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity. At this rate, many experts believe that solar energy is not efficient enough to be economically sustainable given the cost to produce the panels themselves. Both <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL), have heavily funded solar research programs. The NREL solar program has a budget of around $75 million  and develops research projects in the areas of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photovoltaic" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> (PV) technology, solar thermal energy, and solar radiation. The budget for Sandia’s solar division is unknown, however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory’s $2.4 billion budget. Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years. The Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) at <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina" title="University of North Carolina">University of North Carolina</a> (UNC) has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology. In 2008, researchers at <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water. Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining. In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., a solar development company backed by German corporation <a href="/wiki/Siemens" title="Siemens">Siemens</a>, announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate. Major projects on <a href="/wiki/Artificial_photosynthesis" title="Artificial photosynthesis">artificial photosynthesis</a> or solar fuels are also under way in many developed nations.</p>

<p>Wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds. Today, both <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> have programs dedicated to wind research. Sandia’s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials, aerodynamics, and sensors. The NREL wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production, reducing their capital costs, and making wind energy more cost effective overall. The Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caltech" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost, size, and environmental impact of wind energy production. The president of Sky WindPower Corporation thinks that wind turbines will be able to produce electricity at a cent/kWh at an average which in comparison to coal-generated electricity is a fractional of the cost.</p>
<p>A <b>wind farm</b> is a group of <a href="/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="Wind turbine">wind turbines</a> in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.</p>
<p>Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA and China. The <a href="/wiki/Gansu_Wind_Farm" title="Gansu Wind Farm">Gansu Wind Farm</a> in China has over 5,000 MW installed with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. China has several other "wind power bases" of similar size. The <a href="/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center" title="Alta Wind Energy Center">Alta Wind Energy Center</a> in California is the largest onshore wind farm outside of China, with a capacity of 1020 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">MW</a> of power. Europe leads in the use of wind power with almost 66 GW, about 66 percent of the total globally, with Denmark in the lead according to the countries installed per-capita capacity. As of February 2012, the <a href="/wiki/Walney_Wind_Farm" title="Walney Wind Farm">Walney Wind Farm</a> in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 MW, followed by <a href="/wiki/Thanet_Wind_Farm" title="Thanet Wind Farm">Thanet Wind Farm</a> (300 MW), also in the UK.</p>
<p>There are many large wind farms under construction and these include <a href="/wiki/BARD_Offshore_1" title="BARD Offshore 1">BARD Offshore 1</a> (400 MW), <a href="/wiki/Clyde_Wind_Farm" title="Clyde Wind Farm">Clyde Wind Farm</a> (350 MW), <a href="/wiki/Greater_Gabbard_wind_farm" title="Greater Gabbard wind farm">Greater Gabbard wind farm</a> (500 MW), <a href="/wiki/Lincs_Wind_Farm" title="Lincs Wind Farm">Lincs Wind Farm</a> (270 MW), <a href="/wiki/London_Array" title="London Array">London Array</a> (1000 MW), <a href="/wiki/Lower_Snake_River_Wind_Project" title="Lower Snake River Wind Project">Lower Snake River Wind Project</a> (343 MW), <a href="/wiki/Macarthur_Wind_Farm" title="Macarthur Wind Farm">Macarthur Wind Farm</a> (420 MW), <a href="/wiki/Shepherds_Flat_Wind_Farm" title="Shepherds Flat Wind Farm">Shepherds Flat Wind Farm</a> (845 MW), and <a href="/wiki/Sheringham_Shoal_Offshore_Wind_Farm" title="Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm">Sheringham Shoal</a> (317 MW).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">Biomass</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">Biogas</a></div>

<p>Biomass is <a href="/wiki/Biomaterial" title="Biomaterial">biological material</a> derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called <a href="/wiki/Lignocellulosic_biomass" title="Lignocellulosic biomass">lignocellulosic biomass</a>. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuel</a>. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: <i>thermal</i>, <i>chemical</i>, and <i>biochemical</i> methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and <a href="/wiki/Tree_stump" title="Tree stump">tree stumps</a> –, yard clippings, wood chips and even <a href="/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste" title="Municipal solid waste">municipal solid waste</a>. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial <a href="/wiki/Chemical_industry" title="Chemical industry">chemicals</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a>. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including <a href="/wiki/Miscanthus" title="Miscanthus">miscanthus</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Switchgrass" title="Switchgrass">switchgrass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Populus" title="Populus">poplar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bamboo" title="Bamboo">bamboo</a>, and a variety of tree species, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Eucalyptus" title="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oil_palm" title="Oil palm">oil palm</a> (<a href="/wiki/Palm_oil" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>).</p>
<p>Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO<sub>x</sub>), nitrous oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from this combustion; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution. Biomass combustion is a major contributor.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">Ethanol fuel</a></div>
<p>As the primary source of biofuel in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> production. On the Federal level, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USDA" title="USDA">USDA</a> conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted towards the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.

It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants. Moreover, some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol. Even if we used all the corn crop that we have in the United States and converted it into ethanol it would only produce enough fuel to serve 13 percent of the United States total gasoline consumption.<a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research and is also a member of the <a href="/wiki/Joint_BioEnergy_Institute" title="Joint BioEnergy Institute">Joint BioEnergy Institute</a> (JBEI), a research institute founded by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">Biofuel</a></div>
<p>From 1978 to 1996, the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> experimented with producing <a href="/wiki/Algae_fuel" title="Algae fuel">algae fuel</a> in the "<a href="/wiki/Aquatic_Species_Program" title="Aquatic Species Program">Aquatic Species Program</a>." A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire" title="University of New Hampshire">University of New Hampshire</a> Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants. This oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels, with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol. The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. During the biofuel production process algae actually consumes the carbon dioxide in the air and turns it into oxygen through photosynthesis. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture— unlike food crop-based biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production, since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.</p>
<p>Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on <a href="/wiki/Jatropha_curcas" title="Jatropha curcas">Jatropha curcas</a>, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil.

<p><a href="/wiki/Geothermal_energy" title="Geothermal energy">Geothermal energy</a> is produced by tapping into the thermal energy created and stored within the earth. It arises from the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium and other elements found in the Earth's crust. Geothermal energy can be obtained by drilling into the ground, very similar to oil exploration, and then it is carried by a heat-transfer fluid (e.g. water, brine or steam). Geothermal systems that are mainly dominated by water have the potential to provide greater benefits to the system and will generate more power. Within these liquid-dominated systems, there are possible concerns of subsidence and contamination of ground-water resources. Therefore, protection of ground-water resources is necessary in these systems. This means that careful reservoir production and engineering is necessary in liquid-dominated geothermal reservoir systems. Geothermal energy is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished. However, the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability. Several entities, such as the <a href="/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="Sandia National Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Clean_energy_investments">Clean energy investments</span></h2>
<p>2010 was a record year for green energy investments. According to a report from <a href="/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P." title="Bloomberg L.P.">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>, nearly US $243 billion was invested in wind farms, solar power, electric cars, and other alternative technologies worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase from 2009 and nearly five times the money invested in 2004. China had $51.1 billion investment in clean energy projects in 2010, by far the largest figure for any country.</p>
<p>Within emerging economies, Brazil comes second to China in terms of clean energy investments. Supported by strong energy policies, Brazil has one of the world’s highest biomass and small-hydro power capacities and is poised for significant growth in wind energy investment. The cumulative investment potential in Brazil from 2010 to 2020 is projected as $67 billion.</p>
<p>India is another rising clean energy leader. While India ranked the 10th in private clean energy investments among G-20 members in 2009, over the next 10 years it is expected to rise to the third position, with annual clean energy investment under current policies forecast to grow by 369 percent between 2010 and 2020.</p>
<p>It is clear that the center of growth has started to shift to the developing economies and they may lead the world in the new wave of clean energy investments.</p>
<p>Around the world many sub-national governments - regions, states and provinces - have aggressively pursued sustainable energy investments. In the United States, California's leadership in renewable energy was recognised by The Climate Group when it awarded former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger its inaugural award for international climate leadership in Copenhagen in 2009. In Australia, the state of South Australia - under the leadership of former Premier Mike Rann - has led the way with wind power comprising 26% of its electricity generation by the end of 2011, edging out coal fired generation for the first time. South Australia also has had the highest take-up per capita of household solar panels in Australia following the Rann Government's introduction of solar feed-in laws and educative campaign involving the installation of solar photovoltaic installations on the roofs of prominent public buildings, including the parliament, museum, airport and Adelaide Showgrounds pavilion and schools. Rann, Australia's first climate change minister, passed legislation in 2006 setting targets for renewable energy and emissions cuts, the first legislation in Australia to do so.</p>
<p>Also, in the European Union there is a clear trend of promoting policies encouraging investments and financing for sustainable energy in terms of energy efficiency, innovation in energy exploitation and development of renewable resources, with increased consideration of environmental aspects and sustainability.</p>
