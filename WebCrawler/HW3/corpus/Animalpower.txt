<p>A <b>working animal</b> is an animal, usually <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domesticated</a>, that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks. They may be close members of the family, such as <a href="/wiki/Guide_dog" title="Guide dog">guide dogs</a> or other <a href="/wiki/Assistance_dog" title="Assistance dog">assistance dogs</a>, or they may be animals trained to provide <a href="/wiki/Tractive_force" title="Tractive force">tractive force</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Draft_horse" title="Draft horse">draft horses</a> or logging elephants. The latter types of animals are called <b>draft animals</b> (<b>draught animals</b>) or <b>beasts of burden</b>. Most working animals are either <a href="/wiki/Service_animal" title="Service animal">service animals</a> or draft animals. They may also be used for <a href="/wiki/Milk" title="Milk">milking</a> or <a href="/wiki/Herding" title="Herding">herding</a>, jobs that require human training to encourage the animal to cooperate. Some, at the end of their working lives, may also be used for meat or other products such as leather.</p>
<p>The history of working animals may predate agriculture, with dogs used by our <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> ancestors. Around the world, millions of animals work in relationship with their owners. Domesticated species are often <a href="/wiki/Breed" title="Breed">bred</a> to be suitable for different uses and conditions, especially horses and <a href="/wiki/Working_dog" title="Working dog">working dogs</a>. Working animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from the wild, such as dolphins and some <a href="/wiki/Asian_elephant" title="Asian elephant">Asian elephants</a>.</p>

<p>People have found uses for a wide variety of abilities found in animals and even in industrialized society many animals are still used for work. The strength of horses, elephants and <a href="/wiki/Ox" title="Ox">oxen</a> is used in pulling carts and logs. The keen sense of smell of dogs is used to search for drugs and explosives as well helping to find game while hunting and to search for missing or trapped people. Several animals including <a href="/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">camels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkeys</a>, horses and dogs are used for transport, either riding or to pull wagons and sleds. Other animals including dogs and <a href="/wiki/Monkey" title="Monkey">monkeys</a> provide assistance to blind or disabled people.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, wild animals may be not only tamed, but <a href="/wiki/Animal_training" title="Animal training">trained</a> to perform work, though often solely for novelty or entertainment purposes, as such animals tend to lack the traits of trustworthiness and mild temper that characterize the true domesticated working animal. Conversely, not all domesticated animals are working animals. For example, while cats may perform work catching mice, it is an instinctive behavior, not one that can be trained by human intervention. Other domesticated animals, such as sheep, or rabbits, may have agricultural uses for meat, <a href="/wiki/Hide_(skin)" title="Hide (skin)">hides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wool" title="Wool">wool</a>, but are not suitable for work. Finally, small domestic pets such as most birds (other than certain types of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carrier_pigeon" title="Carrier pigeon">pigeon</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Hamster" title="Hamster">hamsters</a> are generally incapable of performing work other than that of providing simple companionship.</p>

<p>Some animals are used due to sheer physical strength in tasks such as ploughing or logging. Such animals are grouped as a <b>draught</b> or <b>draft animal</b>. Others may be used as <a href="/wiki/Pack_animal" title="Pack animal">pack animals</a>, for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animal-powered_transport" title="Animal-powered transport">animal-powered transport</a>, the movement of people and goods. People ride some animals directly as mounts; Alternatively, one or more animals in <a href="/wiki/Horse_harness" title="Horse harness">harness</a> may be used to pull vehicles.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pack_animal" title="Pack animal">Pack animal</a></div>
<p>Pack animals may be of the same species as mounts or harness animals, though animals such as horses, mules, donkeys, reindeer and both types of camel may have individual bloodlines or <a href="/wiki/Breed" title="Breed">breeds</a> that have been <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selectively bred</a> for packing.

<p>An intermediate use is to <a href="/wiki/Horse_harness" title="Horse harness">harness</a> animals, singly or in <a href="/wiki/Team" title="Team">teams</a>, to pull (or haul) <a href="/wiki/Sled" title="Sled">sleds</a>, wheeled vehicles or <a href="/wiki/Plough" title="Plough">plough</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxen" title="Oxen">Oxen</a> are slow but strong, and have been used in a yoke since ancient times: the earliest surviving vehicle, Puabi's Sumerian sledge, was ox-drawn; an acre was originally defined as the area a span of oxen could plow in a day.

<li><a href="/wiki/Draft_horse" title="Draft horse">Draught or Draft horses</a> are commonly used in harness for heavy work. Several breeds of medium-weight horses are used to pull lighter wheeled carts, carriages and buggies when a certain amount of speed or style is desirable.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mule" title="Mule">Mules</a> are considered to be very tough and strong, with harness capacity dependent on the type of horse <a href="/wiki/Mare" title="Mare">mare</a> used to produce the mule <a href="/wiki/Foal" title="Foal">foal</a>. Because they are a <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrid</a> animal and usually are infertile, separate breeding programs must also be maintained.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pony" title="Pony">Ponies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkeys</a> are often used to pull carts and small wagons, historically, ponies were commonly used in mining to pull ore carts.</li>
<li>Dogs are used for pulling light carts or, particularly, sleds. (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Sled_dog" title="Sled dog">sled dogs</a> such as Huskies) for both recreation and working purposes.</li>
<li>Goats also can perform light harness work in front of carts</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">Reindeer</a> are used in the <a href="/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> and sub-Arctic Nordic countries and Siberia.

In the twenty-first century, Russian soldiers continue to train with reindeer sleds in winter.</li>
<li>Elephants are still used for logging in South-east Asia.</li>
<li>Less often, camels and llamas have been trained to harness. According to <a href="/wiki/Juan_Ignacio_Molina" title="Juan Ignacio Molina">Juan Ignacio Molina</a> the Dutch captain <a href="/wiki/Joris_van_Spilbergen" title="Joris van Spilbergen">Joris van Spilbergen</a> observed the use of <a href="/wiki/Llama" title="Llama">chiliquenes</a> (a llama type) by native <a href="/wiki/Mapuche" title="Mapuche">Mapuches</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mocha_Island" title="Mocha Island">Mocha Island</a> as <a href="/wiki/Plough" title="Plough">plough animals</a> in 1614.</li>

<li>Horses are used in remote areas to help human searchers cover large areas of rugged terrain. Their natural awareness of their surroundings will often alert human handlers to the presence of anything unusual, including lost hikers, hunters or other. Like some dogs, some horses are trained to follow scent. See <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Search_and_rescue_horse" title="Search and rescue horse">Search and rescue horse</a>.</li>
