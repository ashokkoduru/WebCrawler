<p>An electric <b>battery</b> is a device consisting of one or more <a href="/wiki/Electrochemical_cell" title="Electrochemical cell">electrochemical cells</a> with external connections provided to power electrical devices such as <a href="/wiki/Flashlight" title="Flashlight">flashlights</a>, <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Electric_car" title="Electric car">electric cars</a>. When a battery is supplying <a href="/wiki/Electric_power" title="Electric power">electric power</a>, its positive terminal is the <a href="/wiki/Cathode" title="Cathode">cathode</a> and its negative terminal is the <a href="/wiki/Anode" title="Anode">anode</a>. The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, <a href="/wiki/Electrolyte" title="Electrolyte">electrolytes</a> are able to move as ions within, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit. It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. Historically the term "battery" specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved to additionally include devices composed of a single cell.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primary_battery" title="Primary battery">Primary</a> (single-use or "disposable") batteries are used once and discarded; the <a href="/wiki/Electrode" title="Electrode">electrode</a> materials are irreversibly changed during discharge. Common examples are the <a href="/wiki/Alkaline_battery" title="Alkaline battery">alkaline battery</a> used for <a href="/wiki/Flashlight" title="Flashlight">flashlights</a> and a multitude of portable electronic devices. <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery" title="Rechargeable battery">Secondary (rechargeable) batteries</a> can be discharged and recharged multiple times using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mains_power" title="Mains power">mains power</a> from a wall socket; the original composition of the electrodes can be restored by reverse current. Examples include the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lead-acid_batteries" title="Lead-acid batteries">lead-acid batteries</a> used in vehicles and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lithium-ion" title="Lithium-ion">lithium-ion</a> batteries used for portable electronics such as <a href="/wiki/Laptop" title="Laptop">laptops</a> and <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a>.</p>
<p>Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, from miniature cells used to power <a href="/wiki/Hearing_aid" title="Hearing aid">hearing aids</a> and wristwatches to small, thin cells used in <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a>, to large <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lead_acid_battery" title="Lead acid battery">lead acid batteries</a> used in cars and trucks, and at the largest extreme, huge battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby or emergency power for <a href="/wiki/Telephone_exchange" title="Telephone exchange">telephone exchanges</a> and computer <a href="/wiki/Data_center" title="Data center">data centers</a>.</p>
<p>According to a 2005 estimate, the worldwide battery industry generates US$48 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1000000000_(number)" title="1000000000 (number)">billion</a> in sales each year, with 6% annual growth.</p>
<p>Batteries have much lower <a href="/wiki/Specific_energy" title="Specific energy">specific energy</a> (energy per unit mass) than common <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuels</a> such as gasoline. This is somewhat offset by the higher efficiency of electric motors in producing mechanical work, compared to combustion engines.</p>

<p>The usage of "battery" to describe a group of electrical devices dates to <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who in 1748 described multiple <a href="/wiki/Leyden_jar" title="Leyden jar">Leyden jars</a> by analogy to a <a href="/wiki/Artillery_battery" title="Artillery battery">battery of cannon</a> (Benjamin Franklin borrowed the term "battery" from the military, which refers to weapons functioning together).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Alessandro_Volta" title="Alessandro Volta">Alessandro Volta</a> built and described the first electrochemical battery, the <a href="/wiki/Voltaic_pile" title="Voltaic pile">voltaic pile</a>, in 1800. This was a stack of copper and zinc plates, separated by brine-soaked paper disks, that could produce a steady current for a considerable length of time. Volta did not understand that the voltage was due to chemical reactions. He thought that his cells were an inexhaustible source of energy, and that the associated corrosion effects at the electrodes were a mere nuisance, rather than an unavoidable consequence of their operation, as <a href="/wiki/Michael_Faraday" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> showed in 1834.</p>
<p>Although early batteries were of great value for experimental purposes, in practice their voltages fluctuated and they could not provide a large current for a sustained period. The <a href="/wiki/Daniell_cell" title="Daniell cell">Daniell cell</a>, invented in 1836 by British chemist <a href="/wiki/John_Frederic_Daniell" title="John Frederic Daniell">John Frederic Daniell</a>, was the first practical source of electricity, becoming an industry standard and seeing widespread adoption as a power source for <a href="/wiki/Electrical_telegraph" title="Electrical telegraph">electrical telegraph</a> networks. It consisted of a copper pot filled with a <a href="/wiki/Copper_sulfate" title="Copper sulfate">copper sulfate</a> solution, in which was immersed an unglazed <a href="/wiki/Earthenware" title="Earthenware">earthenware</a> container filled with <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> and a zinc electrode.</p>
<p>These wet cells used liquid electrolytes, which were prone to leakage and spillage if not handled correctly. Many used glass jars to hold their components, which made them fragile and potentially dangerous. These characteristics made wet cells unsuitable for portable appliances. Near the end of the nineteenth century, the invention of <a href="/wiki/Dry_cell" title="Dry cell">dry cell batteries</a>, which replaced the liquid electrolyte with a paste, made portable electrical devices practical.</p>

<p>Batteries convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell consists of two <a href="/wiki/Half-cell" title="Half-cell">half-cells</a> connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which <a href="/wiki/Ion#Anions_and_cations" title="Ion">anions</a> (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which <a href="/wiki/Ion#Anions_and_cations" title="Ion">cations</a> (positively charged ions) migrate. <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">Redox</a> reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not touch each other, but are electrically connected by the <a href="/wiki/Electrolyte" title="Electrolyte">electrolyte</a>. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.</p>
<p>Each half-cell has an <a href="/wiki/Electromotive_force" title="Electromotive force">electromotive force</a> (or emf), determined by its ability to drive electric current from the interior to the exterior of the cell. The net emf of the cell is the difference between the emfs of its half-cells. Thus, if the electrodes have emfs <span><span class="mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y" style="display: none;"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/List_of_battery_types" title="List of battery types">List of battery types</a></div>

<p>Batteries are classified into primary and secondary forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Primary</i> batteries are designed to be used until exhausted of energy then discarded. Their chemical reactions are generally not reversible, so they cannot be recharged. When the supply of reactants in the battery is exhausted, the battery stops producing current and is useless.</li>
<li><i>Secondary</i> batteries can be recharged; that is, they can have their chemical reactions reversed by applying <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" title="Electric current">electric current</a> to the cell. This regenerates the original chemical reactants, so they can be used, recharged, and used again multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some types of primary batteries used, for example, for <a href="/wiki/Telegraphy" title="Telegraphy">telegraph</a> circuits, were restored to operation by replacing the electrodes. Secondary batteries are not indefinitely rechargeable due to dissipation of the active materials, loss of electrolyte and internal corrosion.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Primary">Primary</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Primary_cell" title="Primary cell">Primary cell</a></div>
<p>Primary batteries, or <a href="/wiki/Primary_cell" title="Primary cell">primary cells</a>, can produce current immediately on assembly. These are most commonly used in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_densities" title="Energy densities">energy densities</a> than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with <a href="/wiki/Electrical_load" title="Electrical load">loads</a> under 75 <a href="/wiki/Ohm" title="Ohm">ohms</a> (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zinc%E2%80%93carbon_batteries" title="Zinc–carbon batteries">zinc–carbon batteries</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alkaline_batteries" title="Alkaline batteries">alkaline batteries</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Secondary">Secondary</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Rechargeable_battery" title="Rechargeable battery">Rechargeable battery</a></div>
<p>Secondary batteries, also known as <i>secondary cells</i>, or <i>rechargeable batteries</i>, must be charged before first use; they are usually assembled with active materials in the discharged state. Rechargeable batteries are (re)charged by applying electric current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge/use. Devices to supply the appropriate current are called chargers.</p>
<p>The oldest form of rechargeable battery is the <a href="/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery" title="Lead–acid battery">lead–acid battery</a>, which are widely used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Automotive" title="Automotive">automotive</a> and <a href="/wiki/Boating" title="Boating">boating</a> applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy for the amount of electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_battery" title="Car battery">car battery</a>, which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 <a href="/wiki/Ampere" title="Ampere">amperes</a>.</p>
<p>The sealed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Valve_regulated_lead%E2%80%93acid_battery" title="Valve regulated lead–acid battery">valve regulated lead–acid battery</a> (VRLA battery) is popular in the automotive industry as a replacement for the lead–acid wet cell. The VRLA battery uses an immobilized <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> electrolyte, reducing the chance of leakage and extending <a href="/wiki/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">shelf life</a>. VRLA batteries immobilize the electrolyte. The two types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gel_batteries" title="Gel batteries">Gel batteries</a></i> (or "gel cell") use a semi-solid electrolyte.</li>
<li><i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absorbed_Glass_Mat" title="Absorbed Glass Mat">Absorbed Glass Mat</a></i> (AGM) batteries absorb the electrolyte in a special fiberglass matting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other portable rechargeable batteries include several sealed "dry cell" types, that are useful in applications such as mobile phones and <a href="/wiki/Laptop" title="Laptop">laptop computers</a>. Cells of this type (in order of increasing <a href="/wiki/Power_density" title="Power density">power density</a> and cost) include <a href="/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery" title="Nickel–cadmium battery">nickel–cadmium</a> (NiCd), <a href="/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93zinc_battery" title="Nickel–zinc battery">nickel–zinc</a> (NiZn), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nickel_metal_hydride_battery" title="Nickel metal hydride battery">nickel metal hydride</a> (NiMH), and <a href="/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery" title="Lithium-ion battery">lithium-ion</a> (Li-ion) cells. Li-ion has by far the highest share of the dry cell rechargeable market. NiMH has replaced NiCd in most applications due to its higher capacity, but NiCd remains in use in <a href="/wiki/Power_tool" title="Power tool">power tools</a>, <a href="/wiki/Two-way_radio" title="Two-way radio">two-way radios</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Medical_equipment" title="Medical equipment">medical equipment</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, developments include batteries with embedded electronics such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USBCELL" title="USBCELL">USBCELL</a>, which allows charging an AA battery through a <a href="/wiki/USB" title="USB">USB</a> connector, <a href="/wiki/Nanoball_batteries" title="Nanoball batteries">nanoball batteries</a> that allow for a discharge rate about 100x greater than current batteries, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smart_battery" title="Smart battery">smart battery</a> packs with state-of-charge monitors and battery protection circuits that prevent damage on over-discharge. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_self-discharge_NiMH_battery" title="Low self-discharge NiMH battery">Low self-discharge</a> (LSD) allows secondary cells to be charged prior to shipping.</p>

<p>A <i>wet cell</i> battery has a liquid <a href="/wiki/Electrolyte" title="Electrolyte">electrolyte</a>. Other names are <i>flooded cell</i>, since the liquid covers all internal parts, or <i>vented cell</i>, since gases produced during operation can escape to the air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for <a href="/wiki/Electrochemistry" title="Electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a>. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as <a href="/wiki/Beaker_(glassware)" title="Beaker (glassware)">beakers</a>, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a <a href="/wiki/Concentration_cell" title="Concentration cell">concentration cell</a> is important in understanding <a href="/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a>. Wet cells may be <a href="/wiki/Primary_cell" title="Primary cell">primary cells</a> (non-rechargeable) or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secondary_cell" title="Secondary cell">secondary cells</a> (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the <a href="/wiki/Daniell_cell" title="Daniell cell">Daniell cell</a> were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leclanche_cell" title="Leclanche cell">Leclanche cell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grove_cell" title="Grove cell">Grove cell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bunsen_cell" title="Bunsen cell">Bunsen cell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chromic_acid_cell" title="Chromic acid cell">Chromic acid cell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clark_cell" title="Clark cell">Clark cell</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Weston_cell" title="Weston cell">Weston cell</a>. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_battery" title="Car battery">automobile batteries</a> and in industry for standby power for <a href="/wiki/Switchgear" title="Switchgear">switchgear</a>, telecommunication or large <a href="/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply" title="Uninterruptible power supply">uninterruptible power supplies</a>, but in many places batteries with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gel_cell" title="Gel cell">gel cells</a> have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery_(vented_cell_type)" title="Nickel–cadmium battery (vented cell type)">nickel–cadmium</a> cells.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Dry_cell" title="Dry cell">Dry cell</a></div>

<p>A <i>dry cell</i> uses a paste electrolyte, with only enough moisture to allow current to flow. Unlike a wet cell, a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage. Lead–acid batteries did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gel_battery" title="Gel battery">gel battery</a>.</p>
<p>A common dry cell is the <a href="/wiki/Zinc%E2%80%93carbon_battery" title="Zinc–carbon battery">zinc–carbon battery</a>, sometimes called the dry <a href="/wiki/Leclanch%C3%A9_cell" title="Leclanché cell">Leclanché cell</a>, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 <a href="/wiki/Volt" title="Volt">volts</a>, the same as the <a href="/wiki/Alkaline_battery" title="Alkaline battery">alkaline battery</a> (since both use the same <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a>–<a href="/wiki/Manganese_dioxide" title="Manganese dioxide">manganese dioxide</a> combination). A standard dry cell comprises a <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a> anode, usually in the form of a cylindrical pot, with a <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> cathode in the form of a central rod.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Reserve_battery" title="Reserve battery">reserve battery</a> can be stored unassembled (unactivated and supplying no power) for a long period (perhaps years). When the battery is needed, then it is assembled (e.g., by adding electrolyte); once assembled, the battery is charged and ready to work. For example, a battery for an electronic artillery <a href="/wiki/Fuze" title="Fuze">fuze</a> might be activated by the impact of firing a gun: The acceleration breaks a capsule of electrolyte that activates the battery and powers the fuze's circuits. Reserve batteries are usually designed for a short service life (seconds or minutes) after long storage (years). A <a href="/wiki/Water-activated_battery" title="Water-activated battery">water-activated battery</a> for oceanographic instruments or military applications becomes activated on immersion in water.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cell_performance">Cell performance</span></h3>
<p>A battery's characteristics may vary over load cycle, over <a href="/wiki/Charge_cycle" title="Charge cycle">charge cycle</a>, and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" title="Electric current">current</a> drain, and temperature. At low temperatures, a battery cannot deliver as much power. As such, in cold climates, some car owners install battery warmers, which are small electric heating pads that keep the car battery warm.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Capacity_and_discharge">Capacity and discharge</span></h2>

<p>A battery's <i>capacity</i> is the amount of <a href="/wiki/Electric_charge" title="Electric charge">electric charge</a> it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same open-circuit voltage. Capacity is measured in units such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amp-hour" title="Amp-hour">amp-hour</a> (A·h). The rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at 68 °F (20 °C), while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A·h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at <a href="/wiki/Room_temperature" title="Room temperature">room temperature</a>. The fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, the rate at which the charge is delivered (current), the required terminal voltage, the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.</p>
<p>The higher the discharge rate, the lower the capacity. The relationship between current, discharge time and capacity for a lead acid battery is approximated (over a typical range of current values) by <a href="/wiki/Peukert%27s_law" title="Peukert's law">Peukert's law</a>:</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>Batteries that are stored for a long period or that are discharged at a small fraction of the capacity lose capacity due to the presence of generally irreversible <i>side reactions</i> that consume charge carriers without producing current. This phenomenon is known as internal self-discharge. Further, when batteries are recharged, additional side reactions can occur, reducing capacity for subsequent discharges. After enough recharges, in essence all capacity is lost and the battery stops producing power.</p>
<p>Internal energy losses and limitations on the rate that ions pass through the electrolyte cause battery <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">efficiency</a> to vary. Above a minimum threshold, discharging at a low rate delivers more of the battery's capacity than at a higher rate. Installing batteries with varying A·h ratings does not affect device operation (although it may affect the operation interval) rated for a specific voltage unless load limits are exceeded. High-drain loads such as <a href="/wiki/Digital_camera" title="Digital camera">digital cameras</a> can reduce total capacity, as happens with alkaline batteries. For example, a battery rated at 2 A·h for a 10- or 20-hour discharge would not sustain a current of 1 A for a full two hours as its stated capacity implies.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="C_rate">C rate</span></h3>
<p>The C-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is being discharged. It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour. A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour. A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer <a href="/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply" title="Uninterruptible power supply">uninterruptible power supply</a>, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fast-charging.2C_large_and_light_batteries">Fast-charging, large and light batteries</span></h3>
<p>As of 2012, <a href="/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate" title="Lithium iron phosphate">lithium iron phosphate (<span class="chemf nowrap">LiFePO<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
4</span></span>) battery technology</a> was the fastest-charging/discharging, fully discharging in 10–20 seconds.</p>
<p>As of 2013, the world's largest battery was in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hebei_Province" title="Hebei Province">Hebei Province</a>, China. It stored 36 megawatt-hours of electricity at a cost of $500 million. Another large battery, composed of <a href="/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery" title="Nickel–cadmium battery">Ni–Cd</a> cells, was in <a href="/wiki/Fairbanks,_Alaska" title="Fairbanks, Alaska">Fairbanks, Alaska</a>. It covered 2,000 square metres (22,000 sq ft)—bigger than a football pitch—and weighed 1,300 tonnes. It was manufactured by <a href="/wiki/ABB_Group" title="ABB Group">ABB</a> to provide backup power in the event of a blackout. The battery can provide 40 megawatts of power for up to seven minutes. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sodium%E2%80%93sulfur_batteries" title="Sodium–sulfur batteries">Sodium–sulfur batteries</a> have been used to store <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>. A 4.4 megawatt-hour battery system that can deliver 11 megawatts for 25 minutes stabilizes the output of the Auwahi wind farm in Hawaii.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93sulfur_batteries" title="Lithium–sulfur batteries">Lithium–sulfur batteries</a> were used on the longest and highest solar-powered flight. The recharging speed of lithium-ion batteries can be increased by manufacturing changes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lifetime"><span id="LIFETIME"></span>Lifetime</span></h2>
<p>Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two meanings for rechargeable batteries but only one for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either the length of time a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the <a href="/wiki/Zamboni_pile" title="Zamboni pile">Zamboni pile</a>, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Electric_Bell" title="Oxford Electric Bell">Oxford Electric Bell</a> has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Self-discharge">Self-discharge</span></h3>
<p>Disposable batteries typically lose 8 to 20 percent of their original charge per year when stored at room temperature (20–30 °C). This is known as the "self-discharge" rate, and is due to non-current-producing "side" chemical reactions that occur within the cell even when no load is applied. The rate of side reactions is reduced for batteries are stored at lower temperatures, although some can be damaged by freezing.</p>
<p>Old rechargeable batteries self-discharge more rapidly than disposable alkaline batteries, especially nickel-based batteries; a freshly charged nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery loses 10% of its charge in the first 24 hours, and thereafter discharges at a rate of about 10% a month. However, newer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_self-discharge_NiMH_battery" title="Low self-discharge NiMH battery">low self-discharge nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries</a> and modern lithium designs display a lower self-discharge rate (but still higher than for primary batteries).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Corrosion">Corrosion</span></h3>
<p>Internal parts may corrode and fail, or the active materials may be slowly converted to inactive forms.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_component_changes">Physical component changes</span></h3>

<p>The active material on the battery plates changes chemical composition on each charge and discharge cycle; active material may be lost due to physical changes of volume, further limiting the number of times the battery can be recharged. Most nickel-based batteries are partially discharged when purchased, and must be charged before first use. Newer NiMH batteries are ready to be used when purchased, and have only 15% discharge in a year.</p>
<p>Some deterioration occurs on each charge–discharge cycle. Degradation usually occurs because electrolyte migrates away from the electrodes or because active material detaches from the electrodes. Low-capacity NiMH batteries (1,700–2,000 mA·h) can be charged some 1,000 times, whereas high-capacity NiMH batteries (above 2,500 mA·h) last about 500 cycles. NiCd batteries tend to be rated for 1,000 cycles before their internal resistance permanently increases beyond usable values.</p>

<p>Fast charging increases component changes, shortening battery lifespan.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overcharging">Overcharging</span></h3>
<p>If a charger cannot detect when the battery is fully charged then overcharging is likely, damaging it.</p>

<p>NiCd cells, if used in a particular repetitive manner, may show a decrease in capacity called "<a href="/wiki/Memory_effect" title="Memory effect">memory effect</a>". The effect can be avoided with simple practices. NiMH cells, although similar in chemistry, suffer less from memory effect.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_conditions">Environmental conditions</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Automotive_battery" title="Automotive battery">Automotive</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid" title="Lead–acid">lead–acid</a> rechargeable batteries must endure stress due to vibration, shock, and temperature range. Because of these stresses and <a href="/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery#Sulfation" title="Lead–acid battery">sulfation</a> of their lead plates, few automotive batteries last beyond six years of regular use. Automotive starting <small>(<a href="/wiki/Automotive_battery" title="Automotive battery">SLI</a>: <i>Starting, Lighting, Ignition</i>)</small> batteries have many thin plates to maximize current. In general, the thicker the plates the longer the life. They are typically discharged only slightly before recharge.</p>
<p>"Deep-cycle" lead–acid batteries such as those used in electric golf carts have much thicker plates to extend longevity. The main benefit of the lead–acid battery is its low cost; its main drawbacks are large size and weight for a given capacity and voltage. Lead–acid batteries should never be discharged to below 20% of their capacity, because internal resistance will cause heat and damage when they are recharged. Deep-cycle lead–acid systems often use a low-charge warning light or a low-charge power cut-off switch to prevent the type of damage that will shorten the battery's life.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage">Storage</span></h3>
<p>Battery life can be extended by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a <a href="/wiki/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freezer" title="Freezer">freezer</a>, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can extend the life of alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an alkaline battery at 250 mA at 0 °C is only half as efficient as at 20 °C. Alkaline battery manufacturers such as <a href="/wiki/Duracell" title="Duracell">Duracell</a> do not recommend refrigerating batteries.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Battery_sizes">Battery sizes</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes" title="List of battery sizes">List of battery sizes</a></div>
<p>Primary batteries readily available to consumers range from tiny <a href="/wiki/Button_cell" title="Button cell">button cells</a> used for electric watches, to the No. 6 cell used for signal circuits or other long duration applications. Secondary cells are made in very large sizes; very large batteries can power a <a href="/wiki/Submarine" title="Submarine">submarine</a> or stabilize an <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">electrical grid</a> and help level out peak loads.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hazards">Hazards</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Explosion">Explosion</span></h3>

<p>A battery explosion is caused by misuse or malfunction, such as attempting to recharge a primary (non-rechargeable) battery, or a <a href="/wiki/Short_circuit" title="Short circuit">short circuit</a>. Car batteries are most likely to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents. Car batteries produce <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, which is very explosive, when they are overcharged (because of <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of the water in the electrolyte). The amount of overcharging is usually very small and generates little hydrogen, which dissipates quickly. However, when "jumping" a car battery, the high current can cause the rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited explosively by a nearby spark, for example, when disconnecting a <a href="/wiki/Jumper_cable" title="Jumper cable">jumper cable</a>. When a battery is recharged at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery, leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the battery case. In extreme cases, battery acid may spray violently from the casing and cause injury. Overcharging—that is, attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacity—can also lead to a battery explosion, in addition to leakage or irreversible damage. It may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used. In addition, disposing of a battery via incineration may cause an explosion as steam builds up within the sealed case.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Leakage">Leakage</span></h3>

<p>Many battery chemicals are corrosive, poisonous or both. If leakage occurs, either spontaneously or through accident, the chemicals released may be dangerous. For example, disposable batteries often use a zinc "can" both as a reactant and as the container to hold the other reagents. If this kind of battery is over-discharged, the reagents can emerge through the cardboard and plastic that form the remainder of the container. The active chemical leakage can then damage or disable the equipment that the batteries power. For this reason, many electronic device manufacturers recommend removing the batteries from devices that will not be used for extended periods of time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toxic_materials">Toxic materials</span></h3>
<p>Many types of batteries employ toxic materials such as lead, <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cadmium" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_waste" title="Electronic waste">electronic waste</a> (e-waste). E-waste <a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a> services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the <a href="/wiki/Mercury-Containing_and_Rechargeable_Battery_Management_Act" title="Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act">Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act</a> of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable. California and New York City prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling of cell phones. The rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Battery_Directive" title="Battery Directive">Battery Directive</a> of the European Union has similar requirements, in addition to requiring increased recycling of batteries and promoting research on improved <a href="/wiki/Battery_recycling" title="Battery recycling">battery recycling</a> methods. In accordance with this directive all batteries to be sold within the EU must be marked with the "collection symbol" (a crossed-out wheeled bin). This must cover at least 3% of the surface of prismatic batteries and 1.5% of the surface of cylindrical batteries. All packaging must be marked likewise.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ingestion">Ingestion</span></h3>
<p>Batteries may be harmful or fatal if <a href="/wiki/Swallowing" title="Swallowing">swallowed</a>. Small <a href="/wiki/Button_cell" title="Button cell">button cells</a> can be swallowed, in particular by young children. While in the digestive tract, the battery's electrical discharge may lead to tissue damage; such damage is occasionally serious and can lead to death. Ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the <a href="/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract" title="Gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>. The most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus, resulting in clinical sequelae. Batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere. The likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus is a function of the patient's age and battery size. Disk batteries of 16 mm have become lodged in the esophagi of 2 children younger than 1 year. Older children do not have problems with batteries smaller than 21–23 mm. Liquefaction necrosis may occur because sodium hydroxide is generated by the current produced by the battery (usually at the anode). Perforation has occurred as rapidly as 6 hours after ingestion.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Homemade_cells">Homemade cells</span></h2>
<p>Almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell. As a novelty or science demonstration, it is possible to insert two electrodes made of different metals into a <a href="/wiki/Lemon_battery" title="Lemon battery">lemon</a>, potato, etc. and generate small amounts of electricity. "Two-potato clocks" are also widely available in hobby and toy stores; they consist of a pair of cells, each consisting of a potato (lemon, et cetera) with two electrodes inserted into it, wired in series to form a battery with enough voltage to power a digital clock. Homemade cells of this kind are of no practical use.</p>
<p>A voltaic pile can be made from two coins (such as a nickel and a <a href="/wiki/Penny" title="Penny">penny</a>) and a piece of <a href="/wiki/Paper_towel" title="Paper towel">paper towel</a> dipped in <a href="/wiki/Saline_water" title="Saline water">salt water</a>. Such a pile generates a very low voltage but, when many are stacked in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Series_circuit" title="Series circuit">series</a>, they can replace normal batteries for a short time.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sony" title="Sony">Sony</a> has developed a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_battery" title="Biological battery">biological battery</a> that generates electricity from sugar in a way that is similar to the processes observed in living organisms. The battery generates electricity through the use of enzymes that break down carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Lead acid cells can easily be manufactured at home, but a tedious charge/discharge cycle is needed to 'form' the plates. This is a process in which lead sulfate forms on the plates, and during charge is converted to lead dioxide (positive plate) and pure lead (negative plate). Repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface, increasing the surface area, increasing the current the cell can deliver.</p>
