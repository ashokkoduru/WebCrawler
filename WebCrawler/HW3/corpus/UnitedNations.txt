<p>The <b>United Nations</b> (<b>UN</b>) is an <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization" title="Intergovernmental organization">intergovernmental organization</a> to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 <a href="/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations" title="Member states of the United Nations">member states</a>; there are now 193.

The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Charter" title="United Nations Charter">United Nations Charter</a> was drafted at <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization" title="United Nations Conference on International Organization">a conference</a> in April–June 1945; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korea</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_the_Congo" title="United Nations Operation in the Congo">the Congo</a>, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread <a href="/wiki/Decolonization" title="Decolonization">decolonization</a> in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on <a href="/wiki/Peacekeeping" title="Peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a>. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>The UN has six principal organs: the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> (the main deliberative assembly); the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">Security Council</a> (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council" title="United Nations Economic and Social Council">Economic and Social Council</a> (ECOSOC) (for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat" title="United Nations Secretariat">Secretariat</a> (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a> (the primary judicial organ); and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Trusteeship_Council" title="United Nations Trusteeship Council">United Nations Trusteeship Council</a> (inactive since 1994). <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_System" title="United Nations System">UN System</a> agencies include the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank_Group" title="World Bank Group">World Bank Group</a>, the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>, the <a href="/wiki/World_Food_Programme" title="World Food Programme">World Food Programme</a>, <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, and <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>In the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross" title="International Committee of the Red Cross">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907" title="Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907">Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907</a>. Following the catastrophic loss of life in the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">First World War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference</a> established the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> to maintain harmony between countries. This organization resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be absorbed into the UN. However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, USSR, Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria" title="Japanese invasion of Manchuria">Japanese invasion of Manchuria</a> in 1931, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War" title="Second Italo-Ethiopian War">Second Italo-Ethiopian War</a> in 1935, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="Second Sino-Japanese War">Japanese invasion of China</a> in 1937, and German expansions under <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> that culminated in the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations" title="Declaration by United Nations">Declaration by United Nations</a></div>
<p>The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" title="United States Department of State">US State Department</a> in 1939. The text of the "Declaration by United Nations" was drafted by President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, while meeting at the White House, 29 December 1941. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. "<a href="/wiki/Four_Policemen" title="Four Policemen">Four Policemen</a>" was coined to refer to four major Allied countries, United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China, which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations. Roosevelt first coined the term <i>United Nations</i> to describe the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied countries</a>. "On New Year's Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, <a href="/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov" title="Maxim Litvinov">Maxim Litvinov</a>, of the USSR, and <a href="/wiki/T._V._Soong" title="T. V. Soong">T. V. Soong</a>, of China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures." The term <i>United Nations</i> was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration. One major change from the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Charter" title="Atlantic Charter">Atlantic Charter</a> was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted. By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA<br/>
The Governments signatory hereto,<br/>
Having subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter,<br/>
Being convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world,<br/>
DECLARE:<br/>
(1) Each Government pledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic, against those members of the Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war.<br/>
(2) Each Government pledges itself to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies.<br/>
The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the war, the United Nations became the official term for the Allies. To join countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Founding_the_UN_1945">Founding the UN 1945</span></h3>

<p>The United Nations was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_II)" title="Big Four (World War II)">the Allied Big Four</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">US</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)" title="Republic of China (1912–1949)">China</a>) at the <a href="/wiki/Dumbarton_Oaks_Conference" title="Dumbarton Oaks Conference">Dumbarton Oaks Conference</a> in 1944. After months of planning, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization" title="United Nations Conference on International Organization">UN Conference on International Organization</a> opened in San Francisco, 25 April 1945, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Charter" title="United Nations Charter">United Nations Charter</a>. "The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings: <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Eden" title="Anthony Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, of Britain, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Edward_Stettinius" title="Edward Stettinius">Edward Stettinius</a>, of the United States, <a href="/wiki/T._V._Soong" title="T. V. Soong">T. V. Soong</a>, of China, and <a href="/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov" title="Vyacheslav Molotov">Vyacheslav Molotov</a>, of the Soviet Union. At the later meetings, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Wood,_1st_Earl_of_Halifax" title="Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax">Lord Halifax</a> deputized for Mr. Eden, <a href="/wiki/Wellington_Koo" title="Wellington Koo">Wellington Koo</a> for T. V. Soong, and Mr Gromyko for Mr. Molotov." The UN officially came into existence 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council—France, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)" title="Republic of China (1912–1949)">Republic of China</a>, the Soviet Union, the UK and the US—and by a majority of the other 46 signatories.</p>
<p>The first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and the Security Council took place in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> beginning 6 January 1946. The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the United Nations, and the facility was completed in 1952. Its site—like UN headquarters buildings in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nairobi" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>—is designated as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_territory" title="International territory">international territory</a>. The Norwegian Foreign Minister, <a href="/wiki/Trygve_Lie" title="Trygve Lie">Trygve Lie</a>, was elected as the first UN Secretary-General.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cold_War_era">Cold War era</span></h3>

<p>Though the UN's primary mandate was <a href="/wiki/Peacekeeping" title="Peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a>, the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">North Korean invasion of South Korea</a>, passed in the absence of the USSR.) In 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition <a href="/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>, approving the creation of the state of <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Two years later, <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Bunche" title="Ralph Bunche">Ralph Bunche</a>, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict. In 1956, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force" title="United Nations Emergency Force">first UN peacekeeping force</a> was established to end the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Crisis" title="Suez Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>; however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956" title="Hungarian Revolution of 1956">that country's revolution</a>.</p>
<p>In 1960, the UN deployed <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_the_Congo" title="United Nations Operation in the Congo">United Nations Operation in the Congo</a> (UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to the breakaway <a href="/wiki/State_of_Katanga" title="State of Katanga">State of Katanga</a>, restoring it to the control of the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> by 1964. While travelling to meet with rebel leader <a href="/wiki/Moise_Tshombe" title="Moise Tshombe">Moise Tshombe</a> during the conflict, <a href="/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld" title="Dag Hammarskjöld">Dag Hammarskjöld</a>, often named as one of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General, died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, <a href="/wiki/U_Thant" title="U Thant">U Thant</a>, deployed the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Force_in_Cyprus" title="United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus">United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus</a>, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.</p>
<p>With the spread of <a href="/wiki/Decolonization" title="Decolonization">decolonization</a> in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa. On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but with the support of many <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> nations, the mainland, communist <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">People's Republic of China</a> was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Republic of China</a> that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization. Third World nations organized into the <a href="/wiki/Group_of_77" title="Group of 77">Group of 77</a> coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN. In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379">a resolution</a>, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring <a href="/wiki/Zionism" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly after the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Middle East</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965" title="Indo-Pakistani War of 1965">Kashmir</a>, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-Cold_War">Post-Cold War</span></h3>

<p>After the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades. Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold. The UN negotiated an end to the <a href="/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War" title="Salvadoran Civil War">Salvadoran Civil War</a>, launched a successful <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Transition_Assistance_Group" title="United Nations Transition Assistance Group">peacekeeping mission in Namibia</a>, and oversaw democratic elections in post-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa" title="Apartheid in South Africa">apartheid</a> South Africa and post-<a href="/wiki/Khmer_Rouge" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> Cambodia. In 1991, the UN authorized a <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War" title="Gulf War">US-led coalition</a> that repulsed the Iraqi <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait" title="Invasion of Kuwait">invasion of Kuwait</a>. <a href="/wiki/Brian_Urquhart" title="Brian Urquhart">Brian Urquhart</a>, Under-Secretary-General from 1971 to 1985, later described the hopes raised by these successes as a "false renaissance" for the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.</p>
<p>Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_Somalia_II" title="United Nations Operation in Somalia II">UN mission in Somalia</a> was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mogadishu_(1993)" title="Battle of Mogadishu (1993)">Battle of Mogadishu</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Protection_Force" title="United Nations Protection Force">UN mission to Bosnia</a> faced "worldwide ridicule" for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing. In 1994, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_for_Rwanda" title="United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda">United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a> failed to intervene in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> amid indecision in the Security Council.</p>
<p>Beginning in the last decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, the US President, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, withdrew his nation's funding from <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore. <a href="/wiki/Boutros_Boutros-Ghali" title="Boutros Boutros-Ghali">Boutros Boutros-Ghali</a>, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing the size of the organization somewhat. His successor, <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s and 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_Sierra_Leone" title="United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone">UN mission</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Civil_War" title="Sierra Leone Civil War">Sierra Leone Civil War</a> of 1991–2002 was supplemented by British <a href="/wiki/Royal_Marines" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)" title="War in Afghanistan (2001–present)">invasion of Afghanistan in 2001</a> was overseen by <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a>.In 2003, the United States <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">invaded Iraq</a> despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness. Under the current Secretary-General, <a href="/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the <a href="/wiki/War_in_Darfur" title="War in Darfur">War in Darfur</a> in Sudan and the <a href="/wiki/Kivu_conflict" title="Kivu conflict">Kivu conflict</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the <a href="/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War" title="Syrian Civil War">Syrian Civil War</a>. In 2013, <a href="/wiki/Secretary-General%27s_Internal_Review_Panel_on_United_Nations_Action_in_Sri_Lanka" title="Secretary-General's Internal Review Panel on United Nations Action in Sri Lanka">an internal review</a> of UN actions in <a href="/wiki/Alleged_war_crimes_during_the_final_stages_of_the_Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" title="Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War">the final battles</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" title="Sri Lankan Civil War">Sri Lankan Civil War</a> in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered "systemic failure".

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_System" title="United Nations System">United Nations System</a></div>
<p>The United Nations' system is based on five principal organs: the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">Security Council</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council" title="United Nations Economic and Social Council">Economic and Social Council</a> (ECOSOC), the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat" title="United Nations Secretariat">Secretariat</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>.

<p>Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City. The International Court of Justice is located in <a href="/wiki/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, while other major agencies are based in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Geneva" title="United Nations Office at Geneva">UN offices at Geneva</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Vienna" title="United Nations Office at Vienna">Vienna</a>, and <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Nairobi" title="United Nations Office at Nairobi">Nairobi</a>. Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six <a href="/wiki/Official_language" title="Official language">official languages</a> of the United Nations, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. On the basis of the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_the_Privileges_and_Immunities_of_the_United_Nations" title="Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations">Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations</a>, the UN and its agencies are <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity" title="Diplomatic immunity">immune</a> from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.</p>
<p>Below the six organs sit, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, "an amazing collection of entities and organizations, some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it". These include specialized agencies, research and training institutions, programmes and funds, and other UN entities.</p>
<p>The United Nations obey the <i>Noblemaire principle</i>, which is binding on any organization that belongs to the united nations system. This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest, and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee's nationality. Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations.</p>

The first session convened 10 January 1946 in the <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Central_Hall_Westminster" title="Methodist Central Hall Westminster">Methodist Central Hall Westminster</a> in London and included representatives of 51 nations.</p>
<p>When the General Assembly votes on important questions, a two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.</p>
<p>Draft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by eight committees:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Committee – a supervisory committee consisting of the assembly's president, vice-president, and committee heads</li>
<li>Credentials Committee – responsible for determining the credentials of each member nation's UN representatives</li>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a></div>

<p>The Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries. While other organs of the United Nations can only make "recommendations" to member states, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out, under the terms of Charter Article 25. The decisions of the Council are known as <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_resolution" title="United Nations Security Council resolution">United Nations Security Council resolutions</a>.</p>
<p>The Security Council is made up of fifteen member states, consisting of five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and ten non-permanent members—Angola (term ends 2016), Chad (2015), Chile (2015), Jordan (2015), Lithuania (2015), Malaysia (2016), New Zealand (2016), Nigeria (2015), Spain (2016), and Venezuela (2016). The five permanent members hold <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power" title="United Nations Security Council veto power">veto power</a> over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with member states voted in by the General Assembly on a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Regional_Groups" title="United Nations Regional Groups">regional basis</a>. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Secretariat">Secretariat</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat" title="United Nations Secretariat">United Nations Secretariat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="Secretary-General of the United Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a></div>
<p>The UN Secretariat is headed by the <a href="/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="Secretary-General of the United Nations">Secretary-General</a>, assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide. It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies.</p>

<p>The Secretary-General acts as the <i>de facto</i> spokesperson and leader of the UN. The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization's "chief administrative officer". Article 99 of the charter states that the Secretary-General can bring to the Security Council's attention "any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security", a phrase that Secretaries-General since <a href="/wiki/Trygve_Lie" title="Trygve Lie">Trygve Lie</a> have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage. The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues.</p>
<p>The Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power. There are no specific criteria for the post, but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years, that the post shall be appointed on the basis of geographical rotation, and that the Secretary-General shall not originate from one of the five permanent Security Council member states. The current Secretary-General is <a href="/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon" title="Ban Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a>, who replaced <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> in 2007 and was elected for a second term to conclude at the end of 2016.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a></div>

<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the <a href="/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_International_Justice" title="Permanent Court of International Justice">Permanent Court of International Justice</a>. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.</p>
<p>It is based in the <a href="/wiki/Peace_Palace" title="Peace Palace">Peace Palace</a> in The Hague, sharing the building with the <a href="/wiki/Hague_Academy_of_International_Law" title="Hague Academy of International Law">Hague Academy of International Law</a>, a private centre for the study of international law. The ICJ's primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states. The court has heard cases related to war crimes, illegal state interference, ethnic cleansing, and other issues. The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_and_Social_Council">Economic and Social Council</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council" title="United Nations Economic and Social Council">United Nations Economic and Social Council</a></div>
<p>The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations. Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.</p>
<p>ECOSOC's subsidiary bodies include the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Permanent_Forum_on_Indigenous_Issues" title="United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues">United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues</a>, which advises UN agencies on issues relating to <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a>; the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Forum_on_Forests" title="United Nations Forum on Forests">United Nations Forum on Forests</a>, which co-ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management; the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Statistical_Commission" title="United Nations Statistical Commission">United Nations Statistical Commission</a>, which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts between agencies; and the <a href="/wiki/Commission_on_Sustainable_Development" title="Commission on Sustainable Development">Commission on Sustainable Development</a>, which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>. ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-governmental organizations; by 2004, more than 2,200 organizations had received this status.</p>

<p>The UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the UN can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the <a href="/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" title="International Atomic Energy Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank_Group" title="World Bank Group">World Bank</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through the work of the WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees" title="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees">UNHCR</a>).</p>

<p>With the addition of <a href="/wiki/South_Sudan" title="South Sudan">South Sudan</a> 14 July 2011, there are 193 United Nations member states, including all <a href="/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition" title="List of states with limited recognition">undisputed</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states" title="List of sovereign states">independent states</a> apart from <a href="/wiki/Vatican_City" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a>.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Group_of_77" title="Group of 77">Group of 77</a></div>
<p>The Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations, designed to promote its members' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations. Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries. The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the "Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries" issued at the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development" title="United Nations Conference on Trade and Development">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development</a> (UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in <a href="/wiki/Algiers" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> in 1967, where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_peacekeeping" title="United Nations peacekeeping">United Nations peacekeeping</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_peacekeeping_missions" title="List of United Nations peacekeeping missions">List of United Nations peacekeeping missions</a></div>

<p>The UN, after approval by the Security Council, sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed "Blue Helmets" for their distinctive gear. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.</p>
<p>In September 2013, the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions. The largest was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Organization_Stabilization_Mission_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo">United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (MONUSCO), which included 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Military_Observer_Group_in_India_and_Pakistan" title="United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan">United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan</a> (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in <a href="/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir" title="Jammu and Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>. UN peacekeepers with the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Truce_Supervision_Organization" title="United Nations Truce Supervision Organization">United Nations Truce Supervision Organization</a> (UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.</p>
<p>A study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the United Nations to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the <a href="/wiki/Human_Security_Report_2005" title="Human Security Report 2005">Human Security Report</a> documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).</p>
<p><span id="inaction_on_genocide_and_human_rights"></span></p>

<p>The UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_Genocide" title="1971 Bangladesh Genocide">Bangladesh genocide in 1971</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia" title="Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia">Cambodian genocide</a> in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the <a href="/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the <a href="/wiki/Somali_Civil_War" title="Somali Civil War">Somali Civil War</a>. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2010%E2%80%9313_Haiti_cholera_outbreak" title="2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak">2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak</a>, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.</p>
<p>In addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging <a href="/wiki/Disarmament" title="Disarmament">disarmament</a>. Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation. The advent of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> came only weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution" title="United Nations General Assembly resolution">resolution</a> of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for "the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction". The UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties, such as the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty" title="Outer Space Treaty">Outer Space Treaty</a> (1967), the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons" title="Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> (1968), the <a href="/wiki/Seabed_Arms_Control_Treaty" title="Seabed Arms Control Treaty">Seabed Arms Control Treaty</a> (1971), the <a href="/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention" title="Biological Weapons Convention">Biological Weapons Convention</a> (1972), the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention" title="Chemical Weapons Convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (1992), and the <a href="/wiki/Ottawa_Treaty" title="Ottawa Treaty">Ottawa Treaty</a> (1997), which prohibits landmines. Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the <a href="/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" title="International Atomic Energy Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organization_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons" title="Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty_Organization_Preparatory_Commission" title="Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission">Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_rights">Human rights</span></h3>
<p>One of the UN's primary purposes is "promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion", and member states pledge to undertake "joint and separate action" to protect these rights.</p>

<p>In 1948, the General Assembly adopted a <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, drafted by a committee headed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, <a href="/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor</a>, and including the French lawyer <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Cassin" title="René Cassin">René Cassin</a>. The document proclaims basic civil, political, and economic rights common to all human beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting. The Declaration serves as a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations" rather than a legally binding document, but it has become the basis of two binding treaties, the 1966 <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights" title="International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. In practice, the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.</p>
<p>In 1979, the General Assembly adopted the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_against_Women" title="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</a>, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child" title="Convention on the Rights of the Child">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> in 1989. With the end of the Cold War, the push for human rights action took on new impetus. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights" title="United Nations Commission on Human Rights">United Nations Commission on Human Rights</a> was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN, following the recommendation of that year's <a href="/wiki/World_Conference_on_Human_Rights" title="World Conference on Human Rights">World Conference on Human Rights</a>. Jacques Fomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes this organization's mandate as "broad and vague", with only "meagre" resources to carry it out. In 2006, it was replaced by a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" title="United Nations Human Rights Council">Human Rights Council</a> consisting of 47 nations. Also in 2006, the General Assembly passed a <a href="/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples" title="Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of <a href="/wiki/LGBT" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> people.</p>
<p>Other UN bodies responsible for <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_rights" title="Women's rights">women's rights</a> issues include <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women" title="United Nations Commission on the Status of Women">United Nations Commission on the Status of Women</a>, a commission of ECOSOC founded in 1946; the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Fund_for_Women" title="United Nations Development Fund for Women">United Nations Development Fund for Women</a>, created in 1976; and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_International_Research_and_Training_Institute_for_the_Advancement_of_Women" title="United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women">United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women</a>, founded in 1979. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples, held its first session in 2002.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_development_and_humanitarian_assistance">Economic development and humanitarian assistance</span></h3>

<p>Another primary purpose of the UN is "to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character". Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal, primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and ECOSOC. In 2000, the 192 United Nations member states agreed to achieve eight <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> by 2015.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme" title="United Nations Development Programme">UN Development Programme</a> (UNDP), an organization for grant-based technical assistance founded in 1945, is one of the leading bodies in the field of <a href="/wiki/International_development" title="International development">international development</a>. The organization also publishes the UN <a href="/wiki/Human_Development_Index" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a>, a comparative measure <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index" title="List of countries by Human Development Index">ranking countries</a> by poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, and other factors. The <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO), also founded in 1945, promotes agricultural development and food security. <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> (the United Nations Children's Fund) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Bank_Group" title="World Bank Group">World Bank Group</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) are independent, specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework, according to a 1947 agreement. They were initially formed separately from the UN through the <a href="/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system" title="Bretton Woods system">Bretton Woods Agreement</a> in 1944. The World Bank provides loans for international development, while the IMF promotes international economic co-operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polio" title="Polio">polio</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/River_blindness" title="River blindness">river blindness</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Leprosy" title="Leprosy">leprosy</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Joint_United_Nations_Programme_on_HIV/AIDS" title="Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS">Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS</a> (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Population_Fund" title="UN Population Fund">UN Population Fund</a>, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_health" title="Reproductive health">reproductive health</a> and <a href="/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning">family planning</a> services.</p>
<p>Along with the <a href="/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement" title="International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement">International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</a>, the UN often takes a leading role in co-ordinating emergency relief. The <a href="/wiki/World_Food_Programme" title="World Food Programme">World Food Programme</a> (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees" title="Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees">Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR), established in 1950, works to protect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h3>
<p>Since the UN's creation, over 80 colonies have attained independence. The General Assembly adopted the <a href="/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Granting_of_Independence_to_Colonial_Countries_and_Peoples" title="Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples">Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples</a> in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers. The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the <a href="/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization" title="Special Committee on Decolonization">UN Committee on Decolonization</a>, created in 1962. The committee lists seventeen remaining "Non-Self-Governing Territories", the largest and most populous of which is <a href="/wiki/Western_Sahara" title="Western Sahara">Western Sahara</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning with the formation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UN_Environmental_Programme" title="UN Environmental Programme">UN Environmental Programme</a> (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 <a href="/wiki/Earth_Summit" title="Earth Summit">Earth Summit</a> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO), another UN organization, established the <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, which assesses and reports on research on <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. The UN-sponsored <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.</p>
<p>The UN also declares and co-ordinates <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_observance" title="International observance">international observances</a>, periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern. Examples include <a href="/wiki/World_Tuberculosis_Day" title="World Tuberculosis Day">World Tuberculosis Day</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earth_Day" title="Earth Day">Earth Day</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/International_Year_of_Deserts_and_Desertification" title="International Year of Deserts and Desertification">International Year of Deserts and Desertification</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Funding">Funding</span></h2>

<p>The UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay, as measured by its <a href="/wiki/Gross_national_income" title="Gross national income">gross national income</a> (GNI), with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income. The two-year budget for 2012–13 was $5.512 billion in total.</p>
<p>The Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a "ceiling" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that revision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%. For the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Least_developed_country" title="Least developed country">least developed countries</a> (LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied. In addition to the ceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member nation (or "floor" rate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($55,120 for the two year budget 2013-2014).</p>
<p>A large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget. The peacekeeping budget for the 2015–16 fiscal year was $8.27 billion, supporting 82,318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the world. UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping operations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries. In 2013, the top 10 providers of assessed financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations were the United States (28.38%), Japan (10.83%), France (7.22%), Germany (7.14%), the United Kingdom (6.68%), China (6.64%), Italy (4.45%), the Russian Federation (3.15%), Canada (2.98%), and Spain (2.97%).</p>
<p>Special UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments, corporations, and private individuals.</p>

<p>A number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Cordell_Hull" title="Cordell Hull">Cordell Hull</a> (1945), the latter for his role in the organization's founding. <a href="/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson" title="Lester B. Pearson">Lester B. Pearson</a>, the Canadian <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_External_Affairs" title="Secretary of State for External Affairs">Secretary of State for External Affairs</a>, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" title="International Labour Organization">International Labour Organization</a> in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organization_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons" title="Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> in 2013. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.</p>

<p>Since its founding, there have been many calls for <a href="/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations" title="Reform of the United Nations">reform of the United Nations</a> but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the <a href="/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" title="Reform of the United Nations Security Council">UN Security Council's membership to be increased</a>, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly" title="United Nations Parliamentary Assembly">United Nations Parliamentary Assembly</a>. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is "the North–South split" between <a href="/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide" title="North–South divide">richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations</a>. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically <a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the <a href="/wiki/French_Committee_of_National_Liberation" title="French Committee of National Liberation">French Committee of National Liberation</a> was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> criticized the UN, famously calling it a <i>machin</i> ("contraption"), and was not convinced that a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_security" title="Global security">global security</a> alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries. Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, "You can't spell communism without U.N." In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that "free nations will not allow the United Nations to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society." In contrast, the French President, <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande" title="François Hollande">François Hollande</a>, stated in 2012 that "France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and bring an end to all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance." Critics such as <a href="/wiki/Dore_Gold" title="Dore Gold">Dore Gold</a>, an Israeli diplomat, <a href="/wiki/Robert_S._Wistrich" title="Robert S. Wistrich">Robert S. Wistrich</a>, a British scholar, <a href="/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz" title="Alan Dershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a>, an American legal scholar, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" title="Mark Dreyfus">Mark Dreyfus</a>, an Australian politician, and the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" title="Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a> consider UN attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive. In September 2015, <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>'s Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" title="United Nations Human Rights Council">United Nations Human Rights Council</a> panel that appoints independent experts, a move criticized by human rights groups.</p>
<p>Critics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Inspection_Unit" title="Joint Inspection Unit">Joint Inspection Unit</a> to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced. In 1994, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Office_of_Internal_Oversight_Services" title="United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services">Office of Internal Oversight Services</a> (OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog. In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to <a href="/wiki/Somalia" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> <a href="/wiki/Mohamed_Sahnoun" title="Mohamed Sahnoun">Mohamed Sahnoun</a> published "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in <a href="/wiki/Somalia" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, showing that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the <a href="/wiki/Siad_Barre" title="Siad Barre">Siad Barre</a> regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NGO" title="NGO">NGOs</a>, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvisation. In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended <a href="/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme" title="Oil-for-Food Programme">Oil-for-Food Programme</a>—in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions—had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of <a href="/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)" title="Kickback (bribery)">kickbacks</a>. An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved, as well as raising "significant" questions about the role of <a href="/wiki/Kojo_Annan" title="Kojo Annan">Kojo Annan</a>, the son of Kofi Annan.</p>
<p>In evaluating the UN as a whole, Jacques Fomerand writes that the "accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms. Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions." Evaluating the first 50 years of the UN's history, the author Stanley Meisler writes that <i>"the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders, but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless"</i>, citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts. The British historian <a href="/wiki/Paul_Kennedy" title="Paul Kennedy">Paul Kennedy</a> states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks, "when all its aspects are considered, the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to our children's and grandchildren's generations as well."</p>
