<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The term 'peace' originates most recently from the Anglo-French <i>pes,</i> and the Old French <i>pais</i>, meaning "peace, reconciliation, silence, agreement" (11th century). But, <i>Pes</i> itself comes from the Latin <i>pax</i>, meaning "peace, compact, agreement, treaty of peace, tranquility, absence of hostility, harmony." The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word <a href="/wiki/Shalom" title="Shalom">shalom</a>, which, according to Jewish theology, comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete, whole'.  Although 'peace' is the usual translation, however, it is an incomplete one, because 'shalom,' which is also cognate with the Arabic <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/S-L-M" title="S-L-M">salaam</a></i>, has multiple other meanings in addition to peace, including justice, good health, safety, well-being, prosperity, equity, security, good fortune, and friendliness. At a personal level, peaceful behaviors are kind, considerate, <a href="/wiki/Respect" title="Respect">respectful</a>, just, and tolerant of others' beliefs and behaviors — tending to manifest <a href="/wiki/Good_faith" title="Good faith">goodwill</a>.</p>
<p>This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being "at peace" in one's own mind, as found in European references from c.1200. The early English term is also used in the sense of "<a href="/wiki/Silence" title="Silence">quiet</a>", reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tranquility" title="Tranquility">tranquility</a> — an absence of disturbance or agitation.</p>
<p>In many languages, the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word <a href="/wiki/Aloha" title="Aloha">aloha</a>, as well as the Arabic word <i>salaam</i>. In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase <i><a href="/wiki/Rest_in_peace" title="Rest in peace">rest in peace</a></i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Dietrich_(political_scientist)" title="Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)">Wolfgang Dietrich</a> in his research project which led to the book <i>The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies</i> (2011) maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world. Later, in his <i>Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture</i> (2012), he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families: Energetic/Harmony, Moral/Justice, Modern/Security, Postmodern/Truth, and Transrational, a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Inner_peace" title="Inner peace">Inner peace</a></div>

<p>Inner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace, with enough <a href="/wiki/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress. Being "at peace" is considered by many to be healthy <a href="/wiki/Homeostasis" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a> and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness.</p>
<p>Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as prayer, meditation, t'ai chi ch'uan (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/T%27ai_chi_ch%27uan" title="T'ai chi ch'uan">太极拳, tàijíquán</a>) or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. Finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> as well as the <a href="/wiki/New_Age" title="New Age">New Age</a> movement.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Satyagraha">Satyagraha</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Satyagraha" title="Satyagraha">Satyagraha</a></div>
<p>Satyagraha (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sanskrit_language" title="Sanskrit language">Sanskrit</a>: <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">सत्याग्रह</span> <span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"><i>satyāgraha</i></span>) is a philosophy and practice of <a href="/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance" title="Nonviolent resistance">nonviolent resistance</a> developed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi" title="Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</a>. He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for <a href="/wiki/Indian_independence" title="Indian independence">Indian independence</a> and also during his earlier struggles in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>.</p>
<p>The word <i>satyagraha</i> itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.</p>

<p>Satyagraha theory also influenced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> during the campaigns he led during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Civil_rights_movement" title="Civil rights movement">civil rights movement</a> in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: "They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end..." A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi, but also to <a href="/wiki/A._J._Muste" title="A. J. Muste">A. J. Muste</a>, sums it up: 'There is no way to peace; peace is the way.'</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Justice_and_injustice">Justice and injustice</span></h2>
<p>Since classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book <i><a href="/wiki/Agricola_(book)" title="Agricola (book)">Agricola</a></i> the Roman historian <a href="/wiki/Tacitus" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the <a href="/wiki/Caledonia" title="Caledonia">Caledonian</a> chieftain <a href="/wiki/Calgacus" title="Calgacus">Calgacus</a>, ends <i>Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.</i> (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. — Oxford Revised Translation).</p>
<p>Discussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace. Is it simple absence of mass organized killing (war) or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (<i>just peace</i>). A peace must be seen at least in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple silence of arms, absence of <a href="/wiki/War" title="War">war</a>.</li>
<li>Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by terms such as justice, mutual respect, respect for law and good will.</li>
</ul>
<p>More recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Restorative_Justice" title="Restorative Justice">Restorative Justice</a> methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a <a class="external text" href="http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/" rel="nofollow">United Nations working group on Restorative Justice</a>, have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.</p>

<p>Many different theories of "peace" exist in the world of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peace_studies" title="Peace studies">peace studies</a>, which involves the study of conflict transformation, disarmament, and cessation of violence. The definition of "peace" can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.</p>
<p>One definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.</p>

<p>The Peace War Game is a <a href="/wiki/Game_theory" title="Game theory">game theory</a> approach to peace and conflict studies. An <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iterated_game" title="Iterated game">iterated game</a> originally played in academic groups and by <a href="/wiki/Computer_simulation" title="Computer simulation">computer simulation</a> for years to study possible strategies of <a href="/wiki/Cooperation" title="Cooperation">cooperation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aggression" title="Aggression">aggression</a>. As peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. The only <a href="/wiki/Strategy" title="Strategy">strategy</a> that acquired wealth more rapidly was a "<a href="/wiki/Genghis_Khan" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>", a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led to the development of the "provokable nice guy" <a href="/wiki/Strategy" title="Strategy">strategy</a>, a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked. Multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Balance_of_power_theories">Balance of power theories</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)" title="Balance of power (international relations)">Balance of power (international relations)</a></div>
<p>The classical "realist" position is that the key to promoting order between states, and so of increasing the chances of peace, is the maintenance of a <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)" title="Balance of power (international relations)">balance of power</a> between states - a situation where no state is so dominant that it can "lay down the law to the rest". Exponents of this view have included <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metternich" title="Metternich">Metternich</a>, <a href="/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck" title="Otto von Bismarck">Bismarck</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hans_Morgenthau" title="Hans Morgenthau">Hans Morgenthau</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Henry_Kissinger" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>. A related approach - more in the tradition of <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Grotius" title="Hugo Grotius">Hugo Grotius</a> than <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> - was articulated by the so-called "<a href="/wiki/English_school_of_international_relations_theory" title="English school of international relations theory">English school of international relations theory</a>" such as <a href="/wiki/Martin_Wight" title="Martin Wight">Martin Wight</a> in his book <i>Power Politics</i> (1946, 1978) and <a href="/wiki/Hedley_Bull" title="Hedley Bull">Hedley Bull</a> in <i>The Anarchical Society</i> (1977).</p>
<p>As the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for <a href="/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a>.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cold_war" title="Cold war">cold war</a>, a particular form of balance of power - mutual nuclear deterrence - emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the "nuclear umbrella" made it "safe" for smaller wars (e.g. the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vietnam_war" title="Vietnam war">Vietnam war</a> and the Soviet invasion of <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> to end the <a href="/wiki/Prague_Spring" title="Prague Spring">Prague Spring</a>), so making such wars more likely.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory" title="Democratic peace theory">Democratic peace theory</a></div>
<p>The democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Peace.2C_free_trade.2C_interdependence.2C_and_globalization">Peace, free trade, interdependence, and globalization</span></h3>
<p>It was a central tenet of <a href="/wiki/Classical_liberalism" title="Classical liberalism">classical liberalism</a>, for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist <a href="/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> (1883-1946) said that he was "brought up" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s. During the <a href="/wiki/Economic_globalization" title="Economic globalization">economic globalization</a> in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as <a href="/wiki/Norman_Angell" title="Norman Angell">Norman Angell</a> argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1914.</p>
<p>These ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century. These ideas have seen <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> as consistent with, even conducive to, peace.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Peace.2C_socialism.2C_capitalism.2C_and_managed_capitalism">Peace, socialism, capitalism, and managed capitalism</span></h3>
<p>Socialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lenin" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/J.A._Hobson" title="J.A. Hobson">J.A. Hobson</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Strachey_(politician)" title="John Strachey (politician)">John Strachey</a>) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.</p>
<p>However, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist <a href="/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> (1883-1946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> at <a href="/wiki/Breton_Woods,_New_Jersey" title="Breton Woods, New Jersey">Bretton Woods</a> in 1944, and later of the <a href="/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade" title="General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> (subsequently the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theory_of_.27active_peace.27">Theory of 'active peace'</span></h3>
<p>Borrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist <a href="/wiki/Johan_Galtung" title="Johan Galtung">Johan Galtung</a>, one of the pioneers of the field of <a href="/wiki/Peace_and_conflict_studies" title="Peace and conflict studies">Peace Research</a>, on 'Positive Peace', and on the writings of Maine Quaker <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Gray_Cox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Gray Cox (page does not exist)">Gray Cox</a>, a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=John_Woolman_College&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="John Woolman College (page does not exist)">John Woolman College</a> initiative have arrived at a theory of "active peace". This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word <i>shalom</i>. Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure. Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into <i>active peace</i>, dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping, and/or peace building.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Peace.2C_international_organization.2C_and_international_law">Peace, international organization, and international law</span></h3>
<p>One of the most influential theories of peace, especially since <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> led the creation of the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference</a> of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alfred_Zimmern" title="Alfred Zimmern">Alfred Zimmern</a>, for example in his 1936 book <i>The League of Nations and the Rule of Law</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trans-national_solidarity">Trans-national solidarity</span></h3>
<p>Many "idealist" thinkers about international relations - e.g. in the traditions of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kant" title="Kant">Kant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> - have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.</p>
<p>One version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students - an idea most powerfully advanced by <a href="/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes" title="Cecil Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a> in the creation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarships" title="Rhodes Scholarships">Rhodes Scholarships</a>, and his successors such as <a href="/wiki/J._William_Fulbright" title="J. William Fulbright">J. William Fulbright</a>.</p>
<p>Another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Many_peaces">Many peaces</span></h3>
<p>Following <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Dietrich_(political_scientist)" title="Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)">Wolfgang Dietrich</a>, Wolfgang Sützl and the <a href="/wiki/Innsbruck_School_of_Peace_Studies" title="Innsbruck School of Peace Studies">Innsbruck School of Peace Studies</a>, some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of <i>many peaces</i>. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jean_Francois_Lyotard" title="Jean Francois Lyotard">Jean Francois Lyotard</a>. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trans-rational_peaces">Trans-rational peaces</span></h3>
<p>In 2008 <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Dietrich_(political_scientist)" title="Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)">Wolfgang Dietrich</a> enlarged his earlier approach of the <i>many peaces</i> to the so-called <i>five families</i> of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach. Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations. The systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation, the so-called elicitive approach.</p>
