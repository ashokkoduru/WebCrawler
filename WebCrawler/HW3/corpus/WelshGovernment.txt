<p>The <b>Welsh Government</b> (<a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a>: <span lang="cy"><i>Llywodraeth Cymru</i></span>) is the <a href="/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="Executive (government)">executive</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Devolution in the United Kingdom">devolved</a> <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales" title="National Assembly for Wales">National Assembly for Wales</a>. The government was established in 1999 as the <b>Welsh Assembly Government</b> by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_1998" title="Government of Wales Act 1998">Government of Wales Act 1998</a>, which created a devolved administration for Wales in line with the result of the <a href="/wiki/Welsh_devolution_referendum,_1997" title="Welsh devolution referendum, 1997">1997 referendum on Welsh devolution</a>. The government consists of cabinet secretaries, who attend cabinet meetings, and <a href="/wiki/Minister_(government)" title="Minister (government)">ministers</a> and deputy ministers, who do not, and also of a <a href="/wiki/Counsel_General_for_Wales" title="Counsel General for Wales">counsel general</a>. It is led by the <a href="/wiki/First_Minister_of_Wales" title="First Minister of Wales">first minister</a>, usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly, who selects cabinet secretaries, ministers and deputy ministers with the approval of the assembly.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1999_to_2007_.28Executive_Committee_of_the_National_Assembly.29">1999 to 2007 (Executive Committee of the National Assembly)</span></h3>

<p>As initially established, the Welsh Government had no independent executive powers in law (unlike, for instance, the Scottish ministers and British government ministers). The National Assembly was established as a <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Body_corporate" title="Body corporate">body corporate</a></i> by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_1998" title="Government of Wales Act 1998">Government of Wales Act 1998</a> and the executive, as a <a href="/wiki/Committee" title="Committee">committee</a> of the assembly, only had those powers that the assembly as a whole voted to delegate to ministers.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_2006" title="Government of Wales Act 2006">Government of Wales Act 2006</a> formally separated the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government, giving Welsh ministers independent executive authority, this taking effect after the <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_2007" title="National Assembly for Wales election, 2007">May 2007 elections</a>. Following separation, the Welsh ministers exercise functions in their own right. Further transfers of executive functions from the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Government of the United Kingdom">British government</a> can be made directly to the Welsh ministers (with their consent) by an <a href="/wiki/Order_in_Council" title="Order in Council">Order in Council</a> approved by the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British parliament</a>.</p>
<p>Separation was designed to clarify the respective roles of the assembly and the government. Under the structures established by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_2006" title="Government of Wales Act 2006">Government of Wales Act 2006</a>, the role of Welsh ministers is to make decisions; develop and implement policy; exercise executive functions and make statutory instruments. The 60 assembly members in the National Assembly scrutinise the government's decisions and policies; hold ministers to account; approve budgets for the Welsh Government's programmes; and enact acts of assembly on subjects that have been <a href="/wiki/Reserved_and_excepted_matters" title="Reserved and excepted matters">devolved</a> to the Welsh administration.</p>
<p>The result mirrored much more closely the relationship between the British government and British parliament and that between the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Government" title="Scottish Government">Scottish Government</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="After_the_2007_election_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales">After the 2007 election of the National Assembly for Wales</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_separation">Legal separation</span></h4>
<p>The new arrangements provided for in the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_2006" title="Government of Wales Act 2006">Government of Wales Act 2006</a> created a formal legal separation between the National Assembly for Wales, comprising 60 assembly members, and the Welsh Government, comprising the First Minister, Welsh ministers, deputy ministers and the counsel general. This separation between the two bodies took effect on the appointment of the First Minister by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> following the <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_2007" title="National Assembly for Wales election, 2007">assembly election</a> on 3 May 2007.</p>
<p>Separation was meant to clarify the respective roles of the assembly and the government. The role of the government is to make decisions; develop and implement policy; exercise executive functions and make statutory instruments. The 60 assembly members in the National Assembly scrutinise the Welsh Government's decisions and policies; hold ministers to account; approve budgets for the Welsh Government's programmes; and have the power to enact <a href="/wiki/Measure_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales" title="Measure of the National Assembly for Wales">assembly measures</a> on certain matters. Assembly measures can now go further than the subordinate legislation which the assembly had the power to make prior to 2007.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transfer_of_functions">Transfer of functions</span></h4>
<p>The assembly's functions, including that of making subordinate legislation, in the main, transferred to the Welsh ministers upon separation. A third body was also established under the 2006 Act from May 2007, called the National Assembly for Wales Commission. It employs the staff supporting the new National Assembly for Wales, and holds property, enters into contracts and provides support services on its behalf.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Welsh_ministers">Welsh ministers</span></h4>
<p>The 2006 Act made new provision for the appointment of Welsh ministers. The <a href="/wiki/First_Minister_of_Wales" title="First Minister of Wales">First Minister</a> is nominated by the Assembly and then appointed by Her Majesty the Queen. The First Minister then appoints the Welsh Ministers and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deputy_Welsh_Ministers" title="Deputy Welsh Ministers">Deputy Welsh Ministers</a>, with the approval of Her Majesty. The Act created a new post of <a href="/wiki/Counsel_General_for_Wales" title="Counsel General for Wales">Counsel General for Wales</a>, the principal source of legal advice to the Welsh Government. The Counsel General is appointed by the Queen, on the nomination of the First Minister, whose recommendation must be agreed by the National Assembly. The Counsel General may be, but does not have to be, an Assembly Member. The Act permits a maximum of 12 Welsh Ministers, which includes Deputy Welsh Ministers, but excludes the First Minister and the Counsel General. Accordingly, the maximum size of the Welsh Government is 14.</p>

<p>The Strategic Delivery and Performance Board translates the strategic direction set by the Welsh cabinet and its committees into work that is joined up across Welsh Government departments and makes the best use of its resources. The board is made up of two deputy permanent secretaries, the director-general for health and social services/NHS Wales chief executive, four directors and 3 non-executive directors, and is chaired by the permanent secretary.</p>
<p>Board members are appointed at the discretion of and by the permanent secretary. Membership is not wholly dependent on functional responsibilities; it is designed to provide balanced advice and support to the permanent secretary, and collective leadership to the organisation as a whole.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Welsh_Government_sponsored_bodies" title="Welsh Government sponsored bodies">Welsh Government sponsored bodies</a></div>
<p>The Welsh Government is responsible for a number of Welsh Government sponsored bodies (WGSBs). These are, respectively,</p>
<ul>
<li>executive WGSBs, which are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-departmental_public_bodies" title="Non-departmental public bodies">non-departmental public bodies</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Arts_Council_of_Wales" title="Arts Council of Wales">Arts Council of Wales</a>;</li>

<p>WGSBs are staffed by public servants rather than civil servants.</p>
<p>The Welsh Government is also responsible for some public bodies that are not classed as WGSBs, such as <a href="/wiki/NHS_Wales" title="NHS Wales">NHS Wales</a>, and the Welsh Offices of England and Wales legal offices.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Offices">Offices</span></h2>
<p>The Welsh Government has a total of 35 offices across Wales, with a number in London and overseas. Historically, most <a href="/wiki/Welsh_Office" title="Welsh Office">Welsh Office</a> staff were based in Cardiff, especially in <a href="/wiki/Crown_Buildings,_Cathays_Park" title="Crown Buildings, Cathays Park">Cathays Park</a>. However, in 2002, the Fullerton Review concluded that "the Assembly could no longer sustain having the majority of its operational functions located in and around Cardiff". Since 2004, Welsh Government civil servants have been relocated across Wales as part of the Location Strategy, which involves the creation of new offices at <a href="/wiki/Merthyr_Tydfil" title="Merthyr Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aberystwyth" title="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Llandudno_Junction" title="Llandudno Junction">Llandudno Junction</a>.
