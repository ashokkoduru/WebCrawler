<p><b>Social cognition</b> is how people deal with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conspecifics" title="Conspecifics">conspecifics</a> (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">social psychology</a>, social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_psychology" title="Cognitive psychology">cognitive psychology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Information_processing_theory" title="Information processing theory">information processing theory</a>. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them. The major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception, judgment, and memory of social stimuli; the effects of social and affective factors on information processing; and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes. This level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes.</p>
<p>However, the term <i>social cognition</i> has also been used in multiple areas in <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience" title="Cognitive neuroscience">cognitive neuroscience</a>.In these areas, the term <i>social cognition</i> is most often used to refer to various social abilities disrupted in <a href="/wiki/Autism" title="Autism">autism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> and other disorders. In <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience" title="Cognitive neuroscience">cognitive neuroscience</a> the biological basis of social cognition is investigated. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developmental_psychologist" title="Developmental psychologist">Developmental psychologists</a> study the development of social cognition abilities.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_development">Historical development</span></h2>
<p>Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_psychology" title="Cognitive psychology">cognitive psychology</a> in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">social psychology</a>. Common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as "<a href="/wiki/Mentalism_(psychology)" title="Mentalism (psychology)">cognitive elements</a>" such as <a href="/wiki/Schema_(psychology)" title="Schema (psychology)">schemas</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attribution_theory" title="Attribution theory">attributions</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Stereotype" title="Stereotype">stereotypes</a>. A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_bias" title="Cognitive bias">reasoning</a> (<a href="/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic" title="Representativeness heuristic">representativeness heuristic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy" title="Base rate fallacy">base rate fallacy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Confirmation_bias" title="Confirmation bias">confirmation bias</a>), <a href="/wiki/Attention" title="Attention">attention</a> (<a href="/wiki/Automaticity" title="Automaticity">automaticity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" title="Priming (psychology)">priming</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Memory" title="Memory">memory</a> (schemas, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primacy_effect" title="Primacy effect">primacy and recency</a>). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cognitive" title="Cognitive">cognitive</a> than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as <a href="/wiki/Belief" title="Belief">beliefs</a> and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by <a href="/wiki/Behaviorism" title="Behaviorism">behaviorism</a>.</p>
<p>A notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although this is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attribution_theory" title="Attribution theory">attribution theory</a>). It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as <a href="/wiki/Social_identity_theory" title="Social identity theory">social identity theory</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_representations" title="Social representations">social representations</a> may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a "coherent integrated whole". A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed <a href="/wiki/Motor_cognition" title="Motor cognition">motor cognition</a>, which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_schemas">Social schemas</span></h2>
<p>Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Schema_theory" title="Schema theory">schema theory</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_psychology" title="Cognitive psychology">cognitive psychology</a>, which describes how ideas or "<a href="/wiki/Concept" title="Concept">concepts</a>" are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Representation_(psychology)" title="Representation (psychology)">represented in the brain</a> and how they are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Categorized" title="Categorized">categorized</a>. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or <i>schema</i> is "activated" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.</p>
<p>When a schema is more accessible this means that it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase the accessibility of schemas are <a href="/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience)" title="Salience (neuroscience)">salience</a> and <a href="/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" title="Priming (psychology)">priming</a>. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and <a href="/wiki/Behavior" title="Behavior">behavior</a> toward the female group member. Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.</p>
<p>Social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established <a href="/wiki/Schema_(psychology)" title="Schema (psychology)">schemas</a>, especially when that information contrasts with the existing schema. For example, a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy. After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Confirmation_bias" title="Confirmation bias">confirmation bias</a>. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.</p>
<p>Social cognition researchers are also interested in studying the <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulation</a> of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control. In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_norms" title="Social norms">social norms</a> of the situation in which case an individual is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Motivate" title="Motivate">motivated</a> to <a href="/wiki/Social_inhibition" title="Social inhibition">inhibit</a> the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and <a href="/wiki/Social_behavior" title="Social behavior">social behavior</a>. Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control. High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior. However, when people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_differences">Cultural differences</span></h2>
<p>Social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition. Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study interviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from Swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle. Because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the Bantu herdsmen's schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while the Scottish settler was not.</p>
<p>Studies have found that culture influences social cognition in other ways too. In fact, cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment. For example, a number of studies have found that people who grow up in East Asian cultures such as <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> tend to develop holistic thinking styles, whereas people brought up in Western cultures like Australia and the USA tend to develop analytic thinking styles. The typically Eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other. For example, if an Easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he/she might scan everyone's face in the class, and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling. On the other hand, the typically Western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context. For example, if a Westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling, then he or she might focus only on the classmate's face in order to make the judgment.</p>
<p>Nisbett (2003) suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the East (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>) versus the Greek philosophical traditions (i.e. of Aristotle and Plato) of the West. However, recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures. One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the USA as they contain more objects which compete for attention. In this study, the Eastern holistic thinking style (and focus on the overall context) was attributed to the busier nature of the Japanese physical environment.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_cognitive_neuroscience">Social cognitive neuroscience</span></h2>
<p>Early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of <a href="/wiki/Phineas_Gage" title="Phineas Gage">Phineas Gage</a>, whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes. More recent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neuropsychological" title="Neuropsychological">neuropsychological</a> studies have shown that <a href="/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury" title="Acquired brain injury">brain injuries</a> disrupt social cognitive processes. For example, damage to the frontal lobes can affect emotional responses to social stimuli  and performance on <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_mind" title="Theory of mind">theory of mind</a> tasks. In the <a href="/wiki/Temporal_lobe" title="Temporal lobe">temporal lobe</a>, damage to the <a href="/wiki/Fusiform_gyrus" title="Fusiform gyrus">fusiform gyrus</a> can lead to the <a href="/wiki/Prosopagnosia" title="Prosopagnosia">inability to recognize faces</a>.</p>
<p>People with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Psychological_disorder" title="Psychological disorder">psychological disorders</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Autism" title="Autism">autism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">psychosis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mood_disorder" title="Mood disorder">mood disorder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Williams_syndrome" title="Williams syndrome">Williams syndrome</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder" title="Antisocial personality disorder">antisocial personality disorder</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fragile_X" title="Fragile X">Fragile X</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Turner%27s_syndrome" title="Turner's syndrome">Turner's syndrome</a> show differences in social behavior compared to their unaffected peers. Parents with <a href="/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" title="Posttraumatic stress disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) show disturbances in at least one aspect of social cognition: namely, <a href="/wiki/Joint_attention" title="Joint attention">joint attention</a> with their young children only after a laboratory-induced relational stressor as compared to healthy parents without PTSD. However, whether social cognition is underpinned by domain-specific neural mechanisms is still an open issue. There is now an expanding research field examining how such conditions may bias cognitive processes involved in social interaction, or conversely, how such biases may lead to the symptoms associated with the condition.</p>
<p>The development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively (see <a href="/wiki/Developmental_psychology" title="Developmental psychology">developmental psychology</a>). For example, it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior (such as <a href="/wiki/Face_perception" title="Face perception">facial recognition</a>) may be <a href="/wiki/Psychological_nativism" title="Psychological nativism">innate</a>. Consistent with this, very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice, face and scent of their mother.</p>
