<p>Intensive crop agriculture is characterised by innovations designed to increase yield.

<p>Agricultural development in Britain between the 16th century and the mid-19th century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output. This in turn supported unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped enable the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Historians cited <a href="/wiki/Enclosure" title="Enclosure">enclosure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mechanised_agriculture" title="Mechanised agriculture">mechanization</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Four-field_crop_rotation" title="Four-field crop rotation">four-field crop rotation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selective breeding</a> as the most important innovations.</p>
<p>Industrial agriculture arose along with the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks and <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>
<p>The industrialization phase involved a continuing process of mechanization. Horse-drawn machinery such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/McCormick_reaper" title="McCormick reaper">McCormick reaper</a> revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the <a href="/wiki/Cotton_gin" title="Cotton gin">cotton gin</a> reduced the cost of processing. During this same period, farmers began to use <a href="/wiki/Traction_engine" title="Traction engine">steam-powered</a> <a href="/wiki/Threshing_machine" title="Threshing machine">threshers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tractor" title="Tractor">tractors</a>, although they were expensive and dangerous. In 1892, the first <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gasoline_engine" title="Gasoline engine">gasoline-powered</a> tractor was successfully developed, and in 1923, the <a href="/wiki/International_Harvester" title="International Harvester">International Harvester</a> <a href="/wiki/Farmall" title="Farmall">Farmall</a> tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines. Mechanical harvesters (<a href="/wiki/Combine_harvester" title="Combine harvester">combines</a>), planters, transplanters and other equipment were then developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms.</p>
<p>The identification of <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> (NPK) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, further increasing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crop_yields" title="Crop yields">crop yields</a>. In 1909 the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haber-Bosch" title="Haber-Bosch">Haber-Bosch</a> method to synthesize <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate" title="Ammonium nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> was first demonstrated. NPK fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture, due to concerns that they came with serious side effects such as <a href="/wiki/Soil_compaction_(agriculture)" title="Soil compaction (agriculture)">soil compaction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soil_erosion" title="Soil erosion">soil erosion</a> and declines in overall <a href="/wiki/Soil_fertility" title="Soil fertility">soil fertility</a>, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">entering the food supply</a>.</p>
<p>The identification of <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> as a critical factor in plant growth and <a href="/wiki/Soil_health" title="Soil health">soil health</a>, particularly in the form of <a href="/wiki/Humus" title="Humus">humus</a>, led to so-called <i>sustainable agriculture</i>, alternative forms of intensive agriculture that also surpass traditional agriculture, without side effects or health issues. Farmers adopting this approach were initially referred to as <i>humus farmers</i>, later as <i>organic farmers</i>.</p>
<p>The discovery of <a href="/wiki/Vitamin" title="Vitamin">vitamins</a> and their role in <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a>, in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors, reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements. Chemicals developed for use in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> gave rise to synthetic <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a>.</p>
<p>Following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly, while sustainable intensive farming advanced much more slowly. Most of the resources in developed nations went to improving industrial intensive farming, and very little went to improving <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Organic_farm" title="Organic farm">organic farming</a>. Thus, particularly in the developed nations, industrial intensive farming grew to become the dominant form of agriculture.</p>
<p>The discovery of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Antibiotic" title="Antibiotic">antibiotics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vaccine" title="Vaccine">vaccines</a> facilitated raising livestock in CAFOs by reducing diseases caused by crowding. Developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made long-distance distribution feasible.</p>
<p>Between 1700 and 1980, "the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466%" and yields increased dramatically, particularly because of <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selectively bred</a> high-yielding varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation and machinery. Global agricultural production doubled between 1820 1920; between 1920 and 1950; between 1950 and 1965; and again between 1965 and 1975 to feed a global population that grew from one billion in 1800 to 6.5 billion in 2002. The number of people involved in farming in industrial countries dropped, from 24 percent of the American population to 1.5 percent in 2002. In 1940, each farmworker supplied 11 consumers, whereas in 2002, each worker supplied 90 consumers. The number of farms also decreased and their ownership became more concentrated. In 2000 in the U.S., four companies produced 81 percent of cows, 73 percent of sheep, 57 percent of pigs, and 50 percent of chickens, cited as an example of "<a href="/wiki/Vertical_integration" title="Vertical integration">vertical integration</a>" by the president of the U.S. National Farmers' Union. Between 1967 and 2002 the one million pig farms in America consolidated into 114,000 with 80 million pigs (out of 95 million) produced each year on factory farms, according to the U.S. National Pork Producers Council. According to the <a href="/wiki/Worldwatch_Institute" title="Worldwatch Institute">Worldwatch Institute</a>, 74 percent of the world's poultry, 43 percent of beef, and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.</p>
<p>Concerns over the <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a> of industrial agriculture, which has become associated with <a href="/wiki/Land_degradation" title="Land degradation">decreased</a> <a href="/wiki/Soil_quality" title="Soil quality">soil quality</a>, and over the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides, have not subsided. Alternatives such as <a href="/wiki/Integrated_pest_management" title="Integrated pest management">integrated pest management</a> (IPM) have had little impact because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM is knowledge-intensive. These concerns sustained the <a href="/wiki/Organic_movement" title="Organic movement">organic movement</a> and caused a resurgence in sustainable intensive farming and funding for the development of appropriate technology.</p>
<p>Famines continued throughout the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Confined_animal_feeding_operations">Confined animal feeding operations</span></h4>
<p>Intensive livestock farming, also called "factory farming" is a term referring to the process of raising <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> in confinement at high stocking density. "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Concentrated_animal_feeding_operations" title="Concentrated animal feeding operations">Concentrated animal feeding operations</a>" (CAFO) or "intensive livestock operations", can hold large numbers (some up to hundreds of thousands) of cows, hogs, turkeys or chickens, often indoors. The essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space. The aim is to provide maximum output at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest level of food safety. The term is often used pejoratively. However, CAFOs have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide, both in terms of total food produced and efficiency.</p>
<p>Food and water is delivered to the animals, and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents, vitamin supplements and growth hormones are often employed. Growth hormones are not used on chickens nor on any animal in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. Undesirable behaviours often related to the stress of confinement led to a search for docile breeds (e.g., with natural dominance behaviours bred out), physical restraints to stop interaction, such as individual cages for chickens, or physically modification such as the de-beaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting.</p>
<p>The CAFO designation resulted from the 1972 US <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Federal_Clean_Water_Act" title="Federal Clean Water Act">Federal Clean Water Act</a>, which was enacted to protect and restore lakes and rivers to a "fishable, swimmable" quality. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) identified certain animal feeding operations, along with many other types of industry, as "point source" <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> polluters. These operations were subjected to regulation.</p>
<p>In 17 states in the U.S., isolated cases of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Groundwater_contamination" title="Groundwater contamination">groundwater contamination</a> were linked to CAFOs. For example, the ten million hogs in North Carolina generate 19 million tons of waste per year. The U.S. federal government acknowledges the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waste_disposal" title="Waste disposal">waste disposal</a> issue and requires that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animal_waste" title="Animal waste">animal waste</a> be stored in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Manure_lagoon" title="Manure lagoon">lagoons</a>. These lagoons can be as large as 7.5 acres (30,000 m). Lagoons not protected with an impermeable liner can leak into groundwater under some conditions, as can runoff from manure used as fertilizer. A lagoon that burst in 1995 released 25 million gallons of nitrous sludge in North Carolina's New River. The spill allegedly killed eight to ten million fish.</p>
<p>The large concentration of animals, animal waste and dead animals in a small space poses ethical issues to some consumers. <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Animal_welfare" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a> activists have charged that intensive animal rearing is cruel to animals.</p>
<p>Other concerns include persistent noxious odor, the effects on human health and the role of antibiotics use in the rise of resistant infectious bacteria.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), farms on which animals are intensively reared can cause adverse health reactions in farm workers. Workers may develop acute and/or chronic lung disease, musculoskeletal injuries and may catch ( <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Zoonotic" title="Zoonotic">zoonotic</a>) infections from the animals.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Managed_intensive_rotational_grazing" title="Managed intensive rotational grazing">Managed intensive rotational grazing</a></div>
<p><b>Managed Intensive Rotational Grazing</b> (<b>MIRG</b>), also known as cell grazing, mob grazing and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holistic_management" title="Holistic management">holistic managed planned grazing</a>, is a variety of forage use in which herds/flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh, rested grazing areas to maximize the quality and quantity of <a href="/wiki/Forage" title="Forage">forage</a> growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks and other animals. The herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover. Resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves, rebuild shoot systems, and deepen root systems, resulting in long-term maximum <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a> production. MIRG is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems. MIRG also leave parasites behind to die off minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers. Pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements, and with the increased productivity of MIRG systems, the animals obtain the majority of their nutritional needs, in some cases all, without the supplemental feed sources that are required in continuous grazing systems or CAFOs.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a> transformed farming in many developing countries. It spread technologies that had already existed, but had not been widely used outside of industrialized nations. These technologies included "miracle seeds", pesticides, <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and synthetic nitrogen <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Seeds">Seeds</span></h4>
<p>In the 1970s scientists created strains of <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> that are generally referred to as high-yielding varieties (HYV). HYVs have an increased nitrogen-absorbing potential compared to other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge (fall over) before harvest, semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes. <a href="/wiki/Norin_10_wheat" title="Norin 10 wheat">Norin 10 wheat</a>, a variety developed by <a href="/wiki/Orville_Vogel" title="Orville Vogel">Orville Vogel</a> from Japanese <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dwarf_wheat" title="Dwarf wheat">dwarf wheat</a> varieties, was instrumental in developing wheat cultivars. IR8, the first widely implemented HYV rice to be developed by the <a href="/wiki/International_Rice_Research_Institute" title="International Rice Research Institute">International Rice Research Institute</a>, was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named “Peta” and a Chinese variety named “Dee Geo Woo Gen.”</p>
<p>With the availability of molecular genetics in <a href="/wiki/Arabidopsis" title="Arabidopsis">Arabidopsis</a> and rice the mutant genes responsible (<i>reduced height (rht)</i>, <i>gibberellin insensitive (gai1)</i> and <i>slender rice (slr1)</i>) have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of <a href="/wiki/Gibberellic_acid" title="Gibberellic acid">gibberellic acid</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phytohormone" title="Phytohormone">phytohormone</a> involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more mechanically stable. Nutrients become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the yield effect of chemical fertilisers.</p>
<p>HYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs. They were developed as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F1_hybrids" title="F1 hybrids">F1 hybrids</a>, meaning seeds need to be purchased every season to obtain maximum benefit, thus increasing costs.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">Crop rotation</a></div>

<p>Crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crops" title="Crops">crops</a> in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped. Crop rotation also seeks to balance the nutrient demands of various crops to avoid <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soil_nutrient" title="Soil nutrient">soil nutrient</a> depletion. A traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> through the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legumes" title="Legumes">legumes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Green_manure" title="Green manure">green manure</a> in sequence with cereals and other crops. Crop rotation can also improve <a href="/wiki/Soil_structure" title="Soil structure">soil structure</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fertility_(soil)" title="Fertility (soil)">fertility</a> by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants.

<p>Crop <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Surface_irrigation" title="Surface irrigation">Flood irrigation</a>, the oldest and most common type, is typically unevenly distributed, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. <a href="/wiki/Irrigation#Overhead_.28sprinkler.29_irrigation" title="Irrigation">Overhead irrigation</a>, using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. <a href="/wiki/Drip_irrigation" title="Drip irrigation">Drip irrigation</a> is the most expensive and least-used type, but delivers water to plant roots with minimal losses.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_catchment" title="Water catchment">Water catchment</a> management measures include recharge pits, which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge groundwater supplies. This helps in the replenishment of groundwater wells and eventually reduces soil erosion.

<p>Paddy-based rice-farming has been practiced in Korea since ancient times. A pit-house at the Daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the Middle <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jeulmun_Pottery_Period" title="Jeulmun Pottery Period">Jeulmun Pottery Period</a> (c. 3500-2000 BC) in the <a href="/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" title="Korean Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a>. The earliest rice cultivation there may have used dry-fields instead of paddies.</p>
<p>The earliest <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mumun" title="Mumun">Mumun</a> features were usually located in naturally swampy, low-lying narrow gulleys and fed by local streams. Some Mumun paddies in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles separated by bunds approximately 10 cm in height, while terraced paddies consisted of long irregularly shapes that followed natural contours of the land at various levels.</p>
<p>Like today's, Mumun period rice farmers used terracing, bunds, canals and small reservoirs. Some paddy-farming techniques of the Middle Mumun (c. 850-550 BC) can be interpreted from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice paddies at the Majeon-ni Site. However, <a href="/wiki/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a> tools for paddy-farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC. The spatial scale of individual paddies, and thus entire paddy-fields, increased with the regular use of <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">iron</a> tools in the <a href="/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea" title="Three Kingdoms of Korea">Three Kingdoms of Korea</a> Period (c.

<blockquote>
<p>"Organic systems and the practices that make them effective are being picked up more and more by conventional agriculture and will become the foundation for future farming systems. They won't be called organic, because they'll still use some chemicals and still use some fertilizers, but they'll function much more like today's organic systems than today's conventional systems."</p>

By intensively managing the behavior and movement of livestock, holistic planned grazing simultaneously increases stocking rates and restores grazing land.</p>
<p>Pasture cropping plants grain crops directly into grassland without first applying herbicides. The perennial grasses form a living mulch understory to the grain crop, eliminating the need to plant cover crops after harvest. The pasture is intensively grazed both before and after grain production using holistic planned grazing. This intensive system yields equivalent farmer profits (partly from increased livestock forage) while building new <a href="/wiki/Topsoil" title="Topsoil">topsoil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_sequestration" title="Carbon sequestration">sequestering</a> up to 33 tons of CO2/ha/year.</p>
<p>The Twelve Aprils grazing program for dairy production, developed in partnership with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USDA" title="USDA">USDA</a>-SARE, is similar to pasture cropping, but the crops planted into the perennial pasture are forage crops for dairy herds.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integrated_Multi-Trophic_Aquaculture" title="Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture">Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture</a> (IMTA) is an example of a holistic approach.

<p>The challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society, for the industrial agriculture sector, for the individual farm, and for <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices. This is a continuation of thousands of years of invention in feeding ever growing populations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>[W]hen hunter-gatherers with growing populations depleted the stocks of game and wild foods across the Near East, they were forced to introduce agriculture. But agriculture brought much longer hours of work and a less rich diet than hunter-gatherers enjoyed. Further population growth among shifting slash-and-burn farmers led to shorter fallow periods, falling yields and soil erosion. Plowing and fertilizers were introduced to deal with these problems - but once again involved longer hours of work and degradation of soil resources(Boserup, The Conditions of Agricultural Growth, Allen and Unwin, 1965, expanded and updated in Population and Technology, Blackwell, 1980.).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the point of industrial agriculture is to profitably supply the world at the lowest cost, industrial methods have significant side effects. Further, industrial agriculture is not an indivisible whole, but instead is composed of multiple elements, each of which can be modified in response to market conditions, government regulation and further innovation and has its own side-effects. Various interest groups reach different conclusions on the subject.</p>

<p>An example of industrial agriculture providing cheap and plentiful food is the U.S.'s "most successful program of agricultural development of any country in the world". Between 1930 and 2000 U.S. agricultural productivity (output divided by all inputs) rose by an average of about 2 percent annually causing food prices to decrease. "The percentage of U.S. disposable income spent on food prepared at home decreased, from 22 percent as late as 1950 to 7 percent by the end of the century."</p>
