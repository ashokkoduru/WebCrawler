<p><b><a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">Water</a> security</b> has been defined as "the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks." Sustainable development will not be achieved without a water secure world. A water secure world integrates a concern for the intrinsic value of water with a concern for its use for human survival and well-being. A water secure world harnesses water's productive power and minimises its destructive force. Water security also means addressing environmental protection and the negative effects of poor management. It is also concerned with ending fragmented responsibility for water and integrating water resources management across all sectors – finance, planning, agriculture, energy, tourism, industry, education and health. A water secure world <a href="/wiki/Poverty_reduction" title="Poverty reduction">reduces poverty</a>, advances education, and increases living standards. It is a world where there is an improved quality of life for all, especially for the most vulnerable—usually women and children—who benefit most from good water governance.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Institute" title="Pacific Institute">Pacific Institute</a> "While regional impacts will vary, global <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> will potentially alter agricultural productivity, freshwater availability and quality, access to vital minerals, coastal and island flooding, and more. Among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships, realignment of energy markets and regional economies, and threats to security".</p>
<p>It impacts regions, states and countries. Tensions exist between upstream and downstream users of water within individual jurisdictions.</p>
<p>During history there has been much conflict over use of water from <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">rivers</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Tigris" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Euphrates" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> Rivers. Another highly politicized example is <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel's</a> control of water resources in the <a href="/wiki/Levant" title="Levant">Levant</a> region since its creation, where Israel securing its water resources was one of several drivers for the 1967 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Six_Day_War" title="Six Day War">Six Day War</a>.</p>
<p>Water security is sometimes sought by implementing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_desalination" title="Water desalination">water desalination</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipelines</a> between sources and users, water licences with different security levels and <a href="/wiki/War" title="War">war</a>.</p>
<p>Water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fresh_Water">Fresh Water</span></h2>
<p>Water, in absolute terms, is not in short supply planet-wide. But, according to the United Nations water organization, UN-Water, the total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans is only about 200,000 km3 of water – less than one percent (&lt;1%) of all freshwater resources. And, water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase in the last century. Specifically, water withdrawals are predicted to increase by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries, and 18 per cent in developed countries. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Research">Research</span></h2>

<p>According to <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> (2010), about 80% of the world's population (5.6 billion in 2011) live in areas with threats to water security. The water security is a shared threat to human and nature and it is pandemic. Human water-management strategies can be detrimental to wildlife, such as migrating fish. Regions with intensive agriculture and dense populations, such as the US and Europe, have a high threat of water security. Water is increasingly being used as a weapon in conflict. Water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty, war and conflict, low women’s development and environmental degradation. Researchers estimate that during 2010-2015, ca US$800 billion will be required to cover the annual global investment in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_infrastructure" title="Water infrastructure">water infrastructure</a>. Good management of water resources can jointly manage <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> protection and human water security. Preserving flood plains rather than constructing flood-control reservoirs would provide a cost-effective way to control floods while protecting the biodiversity of wildlife that occupies such areas.</p>
<p>Lawrence Smith, the president of the population institute, asserts that although an overwhelming majority of the planet's surface is composed of water, 97% of this water is constituted of saltwater; the <a href="/wiki/Fresh_water" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a> used to sustain humans is only 3% of the total amount of water on Earth. Therefore, Smith believes that the competition for water in an overpopulated world would pose a major threat to human stability, even going so far as to postulate apocalyptic world wars being fought over the control of thinning ice sheets and nearly desiccated reservoirs. Nevertheless, 2 billion people have supposedly gained access to a safe water source since 1990 who may have earlier lacked it. The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 percent in 1970 to 71 percent in 1990, 79 percent in 2000 and 84 percent in 2004, parallel with rising population. This trend is projected to continue.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> has a limited though renewable <a href="/wiki/Water_supply" title="Water supply">supply of fresh water</a>, stored in <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface waters</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">Oceans</a> are a good source of usable water, but the amount of energy needed to convert <a href="/wiki/Saline_water" title="Saline water">saline water</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potable_water" title="Potable water">potable water</a> is prohibitive with conventional approaches, explaining why only a very small fraction of the world's water supply is derived from <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">desalination</a>. However, modern technologies, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seawater_Greenhouse" title="Seawater Greenhouse">Seawater Greenhouse</a>, use solar energy to desalinate seawater for agriculture and drinking uses in an extremely cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>The world's largest desalination plant is the <a href="/wiki/Jebel_Ali" title="Jebel Ali">Jebel Ali</a> Desalination Plant (Phase 2) in the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>.
