<p>A <b>dam</b> is a barrier that <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">impounds</a> <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">water</a> or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tap_water" title="Tap water">human consumption</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_water" title="Industrial water">industrial use</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aquaculture" title="Aquaculture">aquaculture</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Navigability" title="Navigability">navigability</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">Hydropower</a> is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as <a href="/wiki/Floodgate" title="Floodgate">floodgates</a> or <a href="/wiki/Levee" title="Levee">levees</a> (also known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dike_(construction)" title="Dike (construction)">dikes</a>) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.</p>
<p>The word <i>dam</i> can be traced back to <a href="/wiki/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>, and before that, from <a href="/wiki/Middle_Dutch" title="Middle Dutch">Middle Dutch</a>, as seen in the names of many old cities. The first known appearance of <i>dam</i> stems from 1165. However, there is one village, <a href="/wiki/Obdam" title="Obdam">Obdam</a>, that is already mentioned in 1120. The word seems to be related to the Greek word <i>taphos</i>, meaning "grave" or "grave hill". So the word should be understood as "dike from dug out earth". The names of more than 40 places (with minor changes) from the Middle Dutch era (1150–1500 CE) such as <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> (founded as 'Amstelredam' in the late 12th century) and <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time.</p>

<p>Early dam building took place in <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. Dams were used to control the water level, for Mesopotamia's weather affected the <a href="/wiki/Tigris" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Euphrates" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> rivers.</p>
<p>The earliest known dam is the <a href="/wiki/Jawa_Dam_(Jordan)" title="Jawa Dam (Jordan)">Jawa Dam</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of the capital <a href="/wiki/Amman" title="Amman">Amman</a>. This gravity dam featured an originally 9-metre-high (30 ft) and 1 m-wide (3.3 ft) stone wall, supported by a 50 m-wide (160 ft) earth rampart. The structure is dated to 3000 BC.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptian</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sadd-el-Kafara_Dam" title="Sadd-el-Kafara Dam">Sadd-el-Kafara Dam</a> at Wadi Al-Garawi, located about 25 km (16 mi) south of <a href="/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, was 102 m (335 ft) long at its base and 87 m (285 ft) wide. The structure was built around 2800 or 2600 BC as a <a href="/wiki/Diversion_dam" title="Diversion dam">diversion dam</a> for flood control, but was destroyed by heavy rain during construction or shortly afterwards. During the <a href="/wiki/Twelfth_Dynasty_of_Egypt" title="Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt">Twelfth Dynasty</a> in the 19th century BC, the Pharaohs Senosert III, <a href="/wiki/Amenemhat_III" title="Amenemhat III">Amenemhat III</a> and Amenmehat IV dug a canal 16 km (9.9 mi) long linking the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fayum_Depression" title="Fayum Depression">Fayum Depression</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Nile" title="Nile">Nile</a> in Middle Egypt. Two dams called Ha-Uar running east-west were built to retain water during the annual flood and then release it to surrounding lands. The lake called "Mer-wer" or <a href="/wiki/Lake_Moeris" title="Lake Moeris">Lake Moeris</a> covered 1,700 km (660 sq mi) and is known today as Berkat Qaroun.</p>
<p>One of the engineering wonders of the ancient world was the <a href="/wiki/Marib_Dam" title="Marib Dam">Great Dam of Marib</a> in <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>. Initiated somewhere between 1750 and 1700 BC, it was made of packed earth - triangular in cross section, 580 m (1,900 ft) in length and originally 4 m (13 ft) high - running between two groups of rocks on either side, to which it was linked by substantial stonework. Repairs were carried out during various periods, most important around 750 BC, and 250 years later the dam height was increased to 7 m (23 ft). After the end of the <a href="/wiki/Sabaeans" title="Sabaeans">Kingdom of Saba</a>, the dam fell under the control of the <a href="/wiki/Himyarite_Kingdom" title="Himyarite Kingdom">Ḥimyarites</a> (~115 BC) who undertook further improvements, creating a structure 14 m (46 ft) high, with five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a settling pond, and a 1,000 m (3,300 ft) canal to a distribution tank. These extensive works were not actually finalized until 325 AD and allowed the irrigation of 25,000 acres (100 km).</p>
<p>By the mid-late 3rd century BC, an intricate water-management system within <a href="/wiki/Dholavira" title="Dholavira">Dholavira</a> in modern-day India was built. The system included 16 reservoirs, dams and various channels for collecting water and storing it.</p>

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kallanai" title="Kallanai">Kallanai</a> is constructed of unhewn stone, over 300 m (980 ft) long, 4.5 m (15 ft) high and 20 m (66 ft) wide, across the main stream of the <a href="/wiki/Kaveri" title="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> river in <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_India" title="South India">South India</a>. The basic structure dates to the 2nd century AD and is considered one of the oldest water-diversion or water-regulator structures in the world which is still in use. The purpose of the dam was to divert the waters of the Kaveri across the fertile delta region for irrigation via canals.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dujiangyan_irrigation_system" title="Dujiangyan irrigation system">Du Jiang Yan</a> is the oldest surviving <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> system in China that included a dam that directed waterflow.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roman_engineering">Roman engineering</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/List_of_Roman_dams_and_reservoirs" title="List of Roman dams and reservoirs">Roman dam</a> construction was characterized by "the Romans' ability to plan and organize engineering construction on a grand scale." Roman planners introduced the then-novel concept of large <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoir</a> dams which could secure a permanent <a href="/wiki/Water_supply" title="Water supply">water supply</a> for urban settlements over the dry season. Their pioneering use of water-proof hydraulic <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(masonry)" title="Mortar (masonry)">mortar</a> and particularly <a href="/wiki/Roman_concrete" title="Roman concrete">Roman concrete</a> allowed for much larger dam structures than previously built, such as the <a href="/wiki/Lake_Homs_Dam" title="Lake Homs Dam">Lake Homs Dam</a>, possibly the largest water barrier to that date, and the <a href="/wiki/Harbaqa_Dam" title="Harbaqa Dam">Harbaqa Dam</a>, both in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Syria_(Roman_province)" title="Syria (Roman province)">Roman Syria</a>. The highest Roman dam was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subiaco_Dam" title="Subiaco Dam">Subiaco Dam</a> near <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>; its record height of 50 m (160 ft) remained unsurpassed until its accidental destruction in 1305.</p>
<p>Roman engineers made routine use of ancient standard designs like embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. Apart from that, they displayed a high degree of inventiveness, introducing most of the other basic dam designs which had been unknown until then. These include <a href="/wiki/Arch-gravity_dam" title="Arch-gravity dam">arch-gravity dams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arch_dam" title="Arch dam">arch dams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buttress_dam" title="Buttress dam">buttress dams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arch_dam#Variations" title="Arch dam">multiple arch buttress dams</a>, all of which were known and employed by the 2nd century AD (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Roman_dams" title="List of Roman dams">List of Roman dams</a>). Roman workforces also were the first to build dam bridges, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bridge_of_Valerian" title="Bridge of Valerian">Bridge of Valerian</a> in Iran.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, bridge dams such as the <a href="/wiki/Band-e_Kaisar" title="Band-e Kaisar">Band-e Kaisar</a> were used to provide <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a> through <a href="/wiki/Water_wheel" title="Water wheel">water wheels</a>, which often powered water-raising mechanisms. One of the first was the Roman-built dam bridge in <a href="/wiki/Dezful" title="Dezful">Dezful</a>, which could raise water 50 <a href="/wiki/Cubit" title="Cubit">cubits</a> in height for the <a href="/wiki/Water_supply" title="Water supply">water supply</a> to all houses in the town. Also <a href="/wiki/Diversion_dam" title="Diversion dam">diversion dams</a> were known. <a href="/wiki/Mill_(grinding)" title="Mill (grinding)">Milling</a> dams were introduced which the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Muslim_Agricultural_Revolution" title="Muslim Agricultural Revolution">Muslim engineers</a> called the <i>Pul-i-Bulaiti</i>. The first was built at Shustar on the River <a href="/wiki/Karun" title="Karun">Karun</a>, Iran, and many of these were later built in other parts of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Islamic_world" title="Islamic world">Islamic world</a>. Water was conducted from the back of the dam through a large pipe to drive a water wheel and <a href="/wiki/Watermill" title="Watermill">watermill</a>. In the 10th century, <a href="/wiki/Al-Muqaddasi" title="Al-Muqaddasi">Al-Muqaddasi</a> described several dams in Persia. He reported that one in <a href="/wiki/Ahvaz" title="Ahvaz">Ahwaz</a> was more than 910 m (3,000 ft) long, and that it had many water-wheels raising the water into <a href="/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply)" title="Aqueduct (water supply)">aqueducts</a> through which it flowed into reservoirs of the city. Another one, the Band-i-Amir dam, provided irrigation for 300 villages.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, a low-lying country, dams were often applied to block rivers in order to regulate the water level and to prevent the sea from entering the marsh lands. Such dams often marked the beginning of a town or city because it was easy to cross the river at such a place, and often gave rise to the respective place's names in Dutch.</p>
<p>For instance the Dutch capital <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> (old name <i>Amstelredam</i>) started with a dam through the river <a href="/wiki/Amstel" title="Amstel">Amstel</a> in the late 12th century, and <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> started with a dam through the river <a href="/wiki/Rotte_(river)" title="Rotte (river)">Rotte</a>, a minor tributary of the <a href="/wiki/Nieuwe_Maas" title="Nieuwe Maas">Nieuwe Maas</a>. The central square of Amsterdam, covering the original place of the 800-year-old dam, still carries the name <i><a href="/wiki/Dam_Square" title="Dam Square">Dam Square</a></i> or simply <i>the Dam</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_revolution">Industrial revolution</span></h3>

<p>The Romans were the first to build <a href="/wiki/Arch_dam" title="Arch dam">arch dams</a>, where the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reaction_force" title="Reaction force">reaction forces</a> from the abutment stabilizes the structure from the external <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrostatic_pressure" title="Hydrostatic pressure">hydrostatic pressure</a>, but it was only in the 19th century that the engineering skills and construction materials available were capable of building the first large-scale arch dams.</p>
<p>Three pioneering arch dams were built around the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> in the early 19th century. Henry Russel of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Engineers" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> oversaw the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Mir_Alam_Tank" title="Mir Alam Tank">Mir Alam dam</a> in 1804 to supply water to the city of <a href="/wiki/Hyderabad" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> (it is still in use today). It had a height of 12 m (39 ft) and consisted of 21 arches of variable span.</p>
<p>In the 1820s and 30s, Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="/wiki/John_By" title="John By">John By</a> supervised the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Rideau_Canal" title="Rideau Canal">Rideau Canal</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> near modern-day <a href="/wiki/Ottawa" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> and built a series of curved masonry dams as part of the waterway system. In particular, the <a href="/wiki/Jones_Falls_Dam" title="Jones Falls Dam">Jones Falls Dam</a>, built by <a href="/wiki/John_Redpath" title="John Redpath">John Redpath</a>, was completed in 1832 as the largest dam in <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and an engineering marvel. In order to keep the water in control during construction, two <a href="/wiki/Sluice" title="Sluice">sluices</a>, artificial channels for conducting water, were kept open in the dam. The first was near the base of the dam on its east side. A second sluice was put in on the west side of the dam, about 20 ft (6.1 m) above the base. To make the switch from the lower to upper sluice, the outlet of Sand Lake was blocked off.</p>

<p>Hunts Creek near the city of <a href="/wiki/Parramatta" title="Parramatta">Parramatta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, was dammed in the 1850s, to cater for the demand for water from the growing population of the city. The masonry <a href="/wiki/Arch_dam" title="Arch dam">arch dam</a> wall was designed by Lieutenant Percy Simpson who was influenced by the advances in dam engineering techniques made by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Engineers" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_India" title="British India">India</a>. The dam cost £17,000 and was completed in 1856 as the first engineered dam built in Australia, and the second arch dam in the world built to mathematical specifications.</p>
<p>The first such dam was opened two years earlier in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. It was the first French arch dam of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">industrial era</a>, and it was built by François Zola in the municipality of <a href="/wiki/Aix-en-Provence" title="Aix-en-Provence">Aix-en-Provence</a> to improve the supply of water after the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_cholera_pandemic_(1829%E2%80%9351)" title="Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)">1832 cholera outbreak</a> devastated the area. After <a href="/wiki/Louis_Philippe_I" title="Louis Philippe I">royal approval</a> was granted in 1844, the dam was constructed over the following decade. Its construction was carried out on the basis of the mathematical results of scientific stress analysis.</p>
<p>The 75-miles dam near <a href="/wiki/Warwick,_Queensland" title="Warwick, Queensland">Warwick</a>, Australia, was possibly the world's first concrete arch dam. Designed by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Charles_Stanley" title="Henry Charles Stanley">Henry Charles Stanley</a> in 1880 with an overflow spillway and a special water outlet, it was eventually heightened to 10 m (33 ft).</p>
<p>In the latter half of the nineteenth century, significant advances in the scientific theory of masonry dam design were made. This transformed dam design from an art based on empirical methodology to a profession based on a rigorously applied scientific theoretical framework. This new emphasis was centered around the engineering faculties of universities in France and in the United Kingdom. <a href="/wiki/William_John_Macquorn_Rankine" title="William John Macquorn Rankine">William John Macquorn Rankine</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Glasgow" title="University of Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> pioneered the theoretical understanding of dam structures in his 1857 paper <i>On the Stability of Loose Earth</i>. <a href="/wiki/Rankine_theory" title="Rankine theory">Rankine theory</a> provided a good understanding of the principles behind dam design. In France, J. Augustin Tortene de Sazilly explained the mechanics of vertically faced masonry gravity dams, and Zola's dam was the first to be built on the basis of these principles.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Large_dams">Large dams</span></h3>

<p>The era of large dams was initiated with the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Aswan_Low_Dam" title="Aswan Low Dam">Aswan Low Dam</a> in Egypt in 1902, a gravity <a href="/wiki/Masonry_dam" title="Masonry dam">masonry</a> <a href="/wiki/Buttress_dam" title="Buttress dam">buttress dam</a> on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nile_River" title="Nile River">Nile River</a>. Following their 1882 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Battle_of_Tel_el-Kebir" title="Battle of Tel el-Kebir">invasion and occupation of Egypt</a>, the British began construction in 1898. The project was designed by Sir <a href="/wiki/William_Willcocks" title="William Willcocks">William Willcocks</a> and involved several eminent engineers of the time, including Sir <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Baker_(engineer)" title="Benjamin Baker (engineer)">Benjamin Baker</a> and Sir <a href="/wiki/Sir_John_Aird,_1st_Baronet" title="Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet">John Aird</a>, whose firm, <a href="/wiki/John_Aird_%26_Co." title="John Aird &amp; Co.">John Aird &amp; Co.</a>, was the main contractor. Capital and financing were furnished by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Cassel" title="Ernest Cassel">Ernest Cassel</a>. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted; on completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> is a massive concrete <a href="/wiki/Arch-gravity_dam" title="Arch-gravity dam">arch-gravity dam</a>, constructed in the <a href="/wiki/Black_Canyon_of_the_Colorado" title="Black Canyon of the Colorado">Black Canyon</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a>, on the border between the US states of <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> between 1931 and 1936 during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. In 1928, Congress authorized the project to build a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a>. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called <a href="/wiki/Six_Companies,_Inc." title="Six Companies, Inc.">Six Companies, Inc.</a> Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and the lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on 1 March 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>By 1997, there were an estimated 800,000 dams worldwide, some 40,000 of them over 15 m (49 ft) high. In 2014, scholars from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> published a study of the cost of large dams – based on the largest existing dataset – documenting significant cost overruns for a majority of dams and questioning whether benefits typically offset costs for such dams.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_dams">Types of dams</span></h2>

<p>Dams can be formed by human agency, natural causes, or even by the intervention of wildlife such as <a href="/wiki/Beaver" title="Beaver">beavers</a>. Man-made dams are typically classified according to their size (height), intended purpose or structure.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_structure">By structure</span></h3>
<p>Based on structure and material used, dams are classified as easily created without materials, <a href="/wiki/Arch-gravity_dam" title="Arch-gravity dam">arch-gravity dams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Embankment_dam" title="Embankment dam">embankment dams</a> or <a href="/wiki/Masonry_dam" title="Masonry dam">masonry dams</a>, with several subtypes.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Arch_dams">Arch dams</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Arch_dam" title="Arch dam">Arch dam</a></div>

<p>In the arch dam, stability is obtained by a combination of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fluid_pressure" title="Fluid pressure">hydrostatic pressure</a> between vertical <a href="/wiki/Cantilever" title="Cantilever">cantilever</a> and arch action will depend upon the <a href="/wiki/Stiffness" title="Stiffness">stiffness</a> of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The <a href="/wiki/Normal_(geometry)" title="Normal (geometry)">normal</a> component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the <a href="/wiki/Abutment" title="Abutment">abutments</a> (either <a href="/wiki/Buttress" title="Buttress">buttress</a> or <a href="/wiki/Canyon" title="Canyon">canyon</a> side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.</p>

<p>Two types of single-arch dams are in use, namely the constant-angle and the constant-radius dam. The constant-radius type employs the same face radius at all elevations of the dam, which means that as the channel grows narrower towards the bottom of the dam the central angle subtended by the face of the dam becomes smaller. <a href="/wiki/Jones_Falls_Dam" title="Jones Falls Dam">Jones Falls Dam</a>, in Canada, is a constant radius dam. In a constant-angle dam, also known as a variable radius dam, this subtended angle is kept a constant and the variation in distance between the abutments at various levels are taken care of by varying the radii. Constant-radius dams are much less common than constant-angle dams. <a href="/wiki/Parker_Dam" title="Parker Dam">Parker Dam</a> on the Colorado River is a constant-angle arch dam.</p>
<p>A similar type is the double-curvature or thin-shell dam. <a href="/wiki/Wild_Horse_Reservoir" title="Wild Horse Reservoir">Wildhorse Dam</a> near <a href="/wiki/Mountain_City,_Nevada" title="Mountain City, Nevada">Mountain City, Nevada</a>, in the United States is an example of the type. This method of construction minimizes the amount of concrete necessary for construction but transmits large loads to the foundation and abutments. The appearance is similar to a single-arch dam but with a distinct vertical curvature to it as well lending it the vague appearance of a concave lens as viewed from downstream.</p>
<p>The multiple-arch dam consists of a number of single-arch dams with concrete buttresses as the supporting abutments, as for example the <a href="/wiki/Daniel-Johnson_Dam" title="Daniel-Johnson Dam">Daniel-Johnson Dam</a>, Québec, Canada. The multiple-arch dam does not require as many buttresses as the hollow gravity type, but requires good rock foundation because the buttress loads are heavy.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravity_dams">Gravity dams</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Gravity_dam" title="Gravity dam">Gravity dam</a></div>

<p>In a gravity dam, the force that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on the mass of the dam. The water presses laterally (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the <a href="/wiki/Parallelogram_law" title="Parallelogram law">resultant</a> of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the designer tries to shape the dam so if one were to consider the part of dam above any particular height to be a whole dam itself, that dam also would be held in place by gravity. i.e. there is no tension in the upstream face of the dam holding the top of the dam down. The designer does this because it is usually more practical to make a dam of material essentially just piled up than to make the material stick together against vertical tension.</p>
<p>Note that the shape that prevents tension in the upstream face also eliminates a balancing compression stress in the downstream face, providing additional economy.</p>
<p>For this type of dam, it is essential to have an impervious foundation with high bearing strength.</p>
<p>When situated on a suitable site, a gravity dam can prove to be a better alternative to other types of dams. When built on a carefully studied foundation, the gravity dam probably represents the best developed example of dam building. Since the fear of <a href="/wiki/Flood" title="Flood">flood</a> is a strong motivator in many regions, gravity dams are being built in some instances where an arch dam would have been more economical.</p>
<p>Gravity dams are classified as "solid" or "hollow" and are generally made of either concrete or masonry.

<p>A gravity dam can be combined with an arch dam into an <a href="/wiki/Arch-gravity_dam" title="Arch-gravity dam">arch-gravity dam</a> for areas with massive amounts of water flow but less material available for a purely gravity dam. The inward compression of the dam by the water reduces the lateral (horizontal) force acting on the dam. Thus, the gravitation force required by the dam is lessened, i.e. the dam does not need to be so massive. This enables thinner dams and saves resources.</p>

<p>A barrage dam is a special kind of dam which consists of a line of large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water passing the dam. The gates are set between flanking piers which are responsible for supporting the water load, and are often used to control and stabilize water flow for irrigation systems. An example of this type of dam is the now-decommissioned <a href="/wiki/Red_Bluff_Diversion_Dam" title="Red Bluff Diversion Dam">Red Bluff Diversion Dam</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Sacramento_River" title="Sacramento River">Sacramento River</a> near <a href="/wiki/Red_Bluff,_California" title="Red Bluff, California">Red Bluff, California</a>.</p>

<p>Embankment dams are made from <a href="/wiki/Soil_compaction" title="Soil compaction">compacted</a> earth, and have two main types, rock-fill and earth-fill dams. Embankment dams rely on their weight to hold back the force of water, like gravity dams made from concrete.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Rock-fill_dams">Rock-fill dams</span></h5>

<p><a href="/wiki/Rock_(geology)" title="Rock (geology)">Rock</a>-fill dams are embankments of compacted free-draining granular earth with an impervious zone. The earth utilized often contains a high percentage of large particles, hence the term "rock-fill". The impervious zone may be on the upstream face and made of <a href="/wiki/Masonry" title="Masonry">masonry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a>, plastic membrane, steel sheet piles, timber or other material. The impervious zone may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a <i>core</i>. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a <i>composite</i> dam. To prevent internal erosion of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of fine grain soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earthquake_liquefaction" title="Earthquake liquefaction">liquefaction</a> of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is <a href="/wiki/New_Melones_Dam" title="New Melones Dam">New Melones Dam</a> in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Fierza_Hydroelectric_Power_Station" title="Fierza Hydroelectric Power Station">Fierza Dam</a> in <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a>.</p>
<p>A core that is growing in popularity is <a href="/wiki/Asphalt_concrete" title="Asphalt concrete">asphalt concrete</a>. The majority of such dams are built with rock and/or gravel as the main fill material. Almost 100 dams of this design have now been built worldwide since the first such dam was completed in 1962. All asphalt-concrete core dams built so far have an excellent performance record. The type of asphalt used is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viscoelastic" title="Viscoelastic">viscoelastic</a>-<a href="/wiki/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> material that can adjust to the movements and deformations imposed on the embankment as a whole, and to settlements in the foundation. The flexible properties of the <a href="/wiki/Asphalt" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a> make such dams especially suited in <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> regions.</p>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Concrete-face_rock-fill_dams">Concrete-face rock-fill dams</span></h5>
<p>A concrete-face rock-fill dam (CFRD) is a rock-fill dam with <a href="/wiki/Concrete_slab" title="Concrete slab">concrete slabs</a> on its upstream face. This design provides the concrete slab as an impervious wall to prevent leakage and also a structure without concern for uplift pressure. In addition, the CFRD design is flexible for topography, faster to construct and less costly than earth-fill dams. The CFRD concept originated during the <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a> in the 1860s when miners constructed rock-fill timber-face dams for <a href="/wiki/Placer_mining#Sluice_box" title="Placer mining">sluice operations</a>. The timber was later replaced by concrete as the design was applied to irrigation and power schemes. As CFRD designs grew in height during the 1960s, the fill was compacted and the slab's horizontal and vertical joints were replaced with improved vertical joints. In the last few decades, the design has become popular.</p>
<p>Currently, the tallest CFRD in the world is the 233 m-tall (764 ft) <a href="/wiki/Shuibuya_Dam" title="Shuibuya Dam">Shuibuya Dam</a> in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> which was completed in 2008.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Earth-fill_dams">Earth-fill dams</span></h5>
<p>Earth-fill dams, also called earthen dams, rolled-earth dams or simply earth dams, are constructed as a simple <a href="/wiki/Embankment_dam" title="Embankment dam">embankment</a> of well compacted earth. A <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homogeneous" title="wikt:homogeneous">homogeneous</a> rolled-earth dam is entirely constructed of one type of material but may contain a drain layer to collect seep water. A zoned-earth dam has distinct parts or zones of dissimilar material, typically a locally plentiful shell with a watertight <a href="/wiki/Clay" title="Clay">clay</a> core. Modern zoned-earth embankments employ filter and drain zones to collect and remove seep water and preserve the integrity of the downstream shell zone. An outdated method of zoned earth dam construction utilized a <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_fill" title="Hydraulic fill">hydraulic fill</a> to produce a watertight core. Rolled-earth dams may also employ a watertight facing or core in the manner of a rock-fill dam. An interesting type of temporary earth dam occasionally used in high latitudes is the frozen-core dam, in which a coolant is circulated through pipes inside the dam to maintain a watertight region of <a href="/wiki/Permafrost" title="Permafrost">permafrost</a> within it.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tarbela_Dam" title="Tarbela Dam">Tarbela Dam</a> is a large dam on the <a href="/wiki/Indus_River" title="Indus River">Indus River</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. It is located about 50 km (31 mi) northwest of <a href="/wiki/Islamabad" title="Islamabad">Islamabad</a>, and a height of 485 ft (148 m) above the river bed and a reservoir size of 95 sq mi (250 km) makes it the largest earth-filled dam in the world. The principal element of the project is an embankment 9,000 feet (2,700 m) long with a maximum height of 465 feet (142 m). The total volume of earth and rock used for the project is approximately 200 million cubic yards (152.8 million cu. meters) which makes it one of the largest man-made structures in the world.</p>
<p>Because earthen dams can be constructed from materials found on-site or nearby, they can be very cost-effective in regions where the cost of producing or bringing in concrete would be prohibitive.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Saddle_dam">Saddle dam</span></h4>
<p>A saddle dam is an auxiliary dam constructed to confine the reservoir created by a primary dam either to permit a higher water elevation and storage or to limit the extent of a reservoir for increased efficiency. An auxiliary dam is constructed in a low spot or "saddle" through which the reservoir would otherwise escape. On occasion, a reservoir is contained by a similar structure called a <a href="/wiki/Levee" title="Levee">dike</a> to prevent inundation of nearby land. Dikes are commonly used for reclamation of arable land from a shallow lake. This is similar to a <a href="/wiki/Levee" title="Levee">levee</a>, which is a wall or embankment built along a river or stream to protect adjacent land from flooding.</p>

<p>A diversionary dam is a structure designed to divert all or a portion of the flow of a river from its natural course. The water may be redirected into a canal or tunnel for irrigation and/or hydroelectric power production.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Underground_dam">Underground dam</span></h4>
<p>Underground dams are used to trap <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> and store all or most of it below the surface for extended use in a localized area. In some cases they are also built to prevent saltwater from intruding into a freshwater aquifer. Underground dams are typically constructed in areas where water resources are minimal and need to be efficiently stored, such as in deserts and on islands like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fukuzato_Dam" title="Fukuzato Dam">Fukuzato Dam</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Okinawa" title="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, Japan.

<p>There are two types of underground dams: a <i>sub-surface</i> and a <i>sand-storage</i> dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> or drainage route from an impervious layer (such as solid bedrock) up to just below the surface. They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or <a href="/wiki/Wadi" title="Wadi">wadi</a>. It must be strong, as floods will wash over its crest. Over time, sand accumulates in layers behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent <a href="/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a>. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the dam body, or by means of a drain pipe.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tailings_dam">Tailings dam</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Tailings_dam" title="Tailings dam">Tailings dam</a></div>
<p>A tailings dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store <a href="/wiki/Tailings" title="Tailings">tailings</a>, which are produced during <a href="/wiki/Mining" title="Mining">mining</a> operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an <a href="/wiki/Ore" title="Ore">ore</a>. Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, but due to cost, a tailings dam is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout the life of the particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it fills with a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings (depending on their size) along with dirt.</p>
<p>There are three raised tailings dam designs, the <i>upstream</i>, <i>downstream</i> and <i>centerline</i>, named according to the movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon <a href="/wiki/Topography" title="Topography">topography</a>, geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream tailings dam consists of <a href="/wiki/Trapezoid" title="Trapezoid">trapezoidal</a> embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and a jagged upstream side which is supported by tailings <a href="/wiki/Slurry" title="Slurry">slurry</a> in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.</p>
<p>Because tailings dams often store toxic chemicals from the mining process, they have an impervious liner to prevent seepage. Water/slurry levels in the tailings pond must be managed for stability and environmental purposes as well.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Timber_dams">Timber dams</span></h4>

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Timber" title="Timber">Timber</a> dams were widely used in the early part of the industrial revolution and in frontier areas due to ease and speed of construction. Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and limit deterioration by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, <a href="/wiki/Cement" title="Cement">cement</a> is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head diversion dam is required or longevity is not an issue. Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures. Two common variations of timber dams were the <i>crib</i> and the <i>plank</i>.</p>
<p><i>Timber crib dams</i> were erected of heavy timbers or dressed logs in the manner of a <a href="/wiki/Log_house" title="Log house">log house</a> and the interior filled with earth or rubble. The heavy crib structure supported the dam's face and the weight of the water. <a href="/wiki/Splash_dam" title="Splash dam">Splash dams</a> were timber crib dams used to help float <a href="/wiki/Logging" title="Logging">logs</a> downstream in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p><i>Timber plank dams</i> were more elegant structures that employed a variety of construction methods utilizing heavy timbers to support a water retaining arrangement of planks.</p>

(See also <a href="/wiki/Causeway" title="Causeway">causeway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Retaining_wall" title="Retaining wall">retaining wall</a>.)</p>
<p>Common uses for cofferdams include construction and repair of offshore oil platforms. In such cases the cofferdam is fabricated from sheet steel and welded into place under water. Air is pumped into the space, displacing the water and allowing a dry work environment below the surface.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_dams">Natural dams</span></h4>
<p>Dams can also be created by natural geological forces. <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_dam" title="Volcanic dam">Volcanic dams</a> are formed when lava flows, often <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basaltic</a>, intercept the path of a stream or lake outlet, resulting in the creation of a natural impoundment. An example would be the eruptions of the <a href="/wiki/Uinkaret_volcanic_field" title="Uinkaret volcanic field">Uinkaret volcanic field</a> about 1.8 million–10,000 years ago, which created lava dams on the <a href="/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a> in northern <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.

<p>As of 2005, hydroelectric power, mostly from dams, supplies some 19% of the world's electricity, and over 63% of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>. Much of this is generated by large dams, although <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> uses small-scale hydro generation on a wide scale and is responsible for about 50% of world use of this type of power.</p>
<p>Most hydroelectric power comes from the <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy" title="Potential energy">potential energy</a> of dammed water driving a <a href="/wiki/Water_turbine" title="Water turbine">water turbine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electric_generator" title="Electric generator">generator</a>; to boost the power generation capabilities of a dam, the water may be run through a large pipe called a <a href="/wiki/Penstock" title="Penstock">penstock</a> before the <a href="/wiki/Turbine" title="Turbine">turbine</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spillways">Spillways</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Spillway" title="Spillway">Spillway</a></div>

<p>A spillway is a section of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have <a href="/wiki/Floodgate" title="Floodgate">floodgates</a> designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A <i>service spillway</i> or <i>primary spillway</i> passes normal flow. An <i>auxiliary spillway</i> releases flow in excess of the capacity of the service spillway. An <i>emergency spillway</i> is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A <i><a href="/wiki/Fuse_plug" title="Fuse plug">fuse plug</a> spillway</i> is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away in the event of a large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed <a href="/wiki/Weir" title="Weir">weirs</a> at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.</p>
<p>The spillway can be gradually <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">eroded</a> by water flow, including <a href="/wiki/Cavitation" title="Cavitation">cavitation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Turbulence" title="Turbulence">turbulence</a> of the water flowing over the spillway, leading to its failure.

<p>Erosion rates are often monitored, and the risk is ordinarily minimized, by shaping the downstream face of the spillway into a curve that minimizes turbulent flow, such as an <a href="/wiki/Ogee" title="Ogee">ogee</a> curve.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_purposes">Common purposes</span></h3>

<p>Some of these purposes are conflicting, and the dam operator needs to make dynamic tradeoffs. For example, power generation and water supply would keep the reservoir high, whereas flood prevention would keep it low. Many dams in areas where precipitation fluctuates in an annual cycle will also see the reservoir fluctuate annually in an attempt to balance these difference purposes. Dam management becomes a complex exercise amongst competing stakeholders.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Location">Location</span></h3>

<p>One of the best places for building a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley; the valley sides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dam's structure is to fill the gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel. The sites are usually those where the gap becomes a minimum for the required storage capacity. The most economical arrangement is often a composite structure such as a <a href="/wiki/Masonry" title="Masonry">masonry</a> dam flanked by earth embankments. The current use of the land to be flooded should be dispensable.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Impact_assessment">Impact assessment</span></h3>
<p>Impact is assessed in several ways: the benefits to human society arising from the dam (agriculture, water, damage prevention and power), harm or benefit to nature and wildlife, impact on the geology of an area (whether the change to water flow and levels will increase or decrease stability), and the disruption to human lives (relocation, loss of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archeological" title="Archeological">archeological</a> or cultural matters underwater).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_impact">Environmental impact</span></h4>

<p>Reservoirs held behind dams affect many ecological aspects of a river. Rivers topography and dynamics depend on a wide range of flows, whilst rivers below dams often experience long periods of very stable flow conditions or sawtooth flow patterns caused by releases followed by no releases. Water releases from a reservoir including that exiting a turbine usually contain very little suspended sediment, and this in turn can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks; for example, the daily cyclic flow variation caused by the <a href="/wiki/Glen_Canyon_Dam" title="Glen Canyon Dam">Glen Canyon Dam</a> was a contributor to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sand_bar" title="Sand bar">sand bar</a> <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a>.</p>
<p>Older dams often lack a <a href="/wiki/Fish_ladder" title="Fish ladder">fish ladder</a>, which keeps many fish from moving upstream to their natural breeding grounds, causing failure of breeding cycles or blocking of migration paths. Even the presence of a fish ladder does not always prevent a reduction in fish reaching the <a href="/wiki/Spawn_(biology)" title="Spawn (biology)">spawning</a> grounds upstream. In some areas, young fish ("smolt") are transported downstream by <a href="/wiki/Barge" title="Barge">barge</a> during parts of the year. Turbine and power-plant designs that have a lower impact upon aquatic life are an active area of research.</p>
<p>A large dam can cause the loss of entire <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecospheres</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered</a> and undiscovered species in the area, and the replacement of the original environment by a new inland lake.</p>
<p>Large reservoirs formed behind dams have been indicated in the contribution of <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">seismic activity</a>, due to changes in water load and/or the height of the water table.</p>
<p>Dams are also found to have a role in the increase/decrease of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. The changing water levels in <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources" title="Greenhouse gas">reservoirs are a source for greenhouse gases</a> like <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>. While dams and the water behind them cover only a small portion of earth's surface, they harbour biological activity that can produce large amounts of greenhouse gases.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_social_impact">Human social impact</span></h4>
<p>The impact on human society is also significant. <a href="/wiki/Nick_Cullather" title="Nick Cullather">Nick Cullather</a> argues in <i>Hungry World: America's Cold War Battle Against Poverty in Asia</i> that dam construction requires <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">the state</a> to displace individual people in the name of the <a href="/wiki/Common_good" title="Common good">common good</a>, and that it often leads to abuses of the masses by planners. He cites <a href="/wiki/Morarji_Desai" title="Morarji Desai">Morarji Desai</a>, Interior Minister of India, in 1960 speaking to villagers upset about the <a href="/wiki/Pong_Dam" title="Pong Dam">Pong Dam</a>, who threatened to "release the waters" and drown the villagers if they did not cooperate.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yangtze_River" title="Yangtze River">Yangtze River</a> in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> is more than five times the size of the <a href="/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> (<a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a>), and creates a reservoir 600 km (370 mi) long to be used for flood control and hydro-power generation. Its construction required the loss of over a million people's homes and their mass relocation, the loss of many valuable archaeological and cultural sites, as well as significant ecological change. During the <a href="/wiki/2010_China_floods" title="2010 China floods">2010 China floods</a>, the dam held back a what would have been a <a href="/wiki/Yangtze#Periodic_floods" title="Yangtze">disastrous flood</a> and the huge reservoir rose by 4 m (13 ft) overnight.</p>
<p>It is estimated that to date, 40–80 million people worldwide have been physically displaced from their homes as a result of dam construction.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Economics">Economics</span></h4>
<p>Construction of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_plant" title="Hydroelectric plant">hydroelectric plant</a> requires a long lead time for site studies, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrological" title="Hydrological">hydrological</a> studies, and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment" title="Environmental impact assessment">environmental impact assessments</a>, and are large-scale projects by comparison to traditional power generation based upon <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>. The number of sites that can be economically developed for hydroelectric production is limited; new sites tend to be far from population centers and usually require extensive <a href="/wiki/Power_transmission" title="Power transmission">power transmission</a> lines. Hydroelectric generation can be vulnerable to major changes in the <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a>, including variations in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rainfall" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a>, ground and surface <a href="/wiki/Water_level" title="Water level">water levels</a>, and glacial melt, causing additional expenditure for the extra capacity to ensure sufficient power is available in low-water years.</p>
<p>Once completed, if it is well designed and maintained, a hydroelectric power source is usually comparatively cheap and reliable. It has no fuel and low escape risk, and as an <a href="/wiki/Alternative_energy" title="Alternative energy">alternative energy</a> source it is cheaper than both nuclear and wind power. It is more easily regulated to store water as needed and generate high power levels on demand compared to <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dam_failure">Dam failure</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Dam_failure" title="Dam failure">Dam failure</a></div>


<p>Dam failures are generally catastrophic if the structure is breached or significantly damaged. Routine <a href="/wiki/Deformation_monitoring" title="Deformation monitoring">deformation monitoring</a> and monitoring of seepage from drains in and around larger dams is useful to anticipate any problems and permit remedial action to be taken before structural failure occurs. Most dams incorporate mechanisms to permit the reservoir to be lowered or even drained in the event of such problems. Another solution can be rock <a href="/wiki/Grout" title="Grout">grouting</a> – <a href="/wiki/Pressure_grouting" title="Pressure grouting">pressure pumping</a> <a href="/wiki/Portland_cement" title="Portland cement">portland cement</a> <a href="/wiki/Slurry" title="Slurry">slurry</a> into weak fractured rock.</p>
<p>During an armed conflict, a dam is to be considered as an "installation containing dangerous forces" due to the massive impact of a possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment. As such, it is protected by the rules of <a href="/wiki/International_humanitarian_law" title="International humanitarian law">international humanitarian law</a> (IHL) and shall not be made the object of attack if that may cause severe losses among the civilian population. To facilitate the identification, a <a href="/wiki/Protective_sign" title="Protective sign">protective sign</a> consisting of three bright orange circles placed on the same axis is defined by the rules of IHL.</p>
<p>The main causes of dam failure include inadequate spillway capacity, piping through the embankment, foundation or abutments, spillway design error (<a href="/wiki/South_Fork_Dam" title="South Fork Dam">South Fork Dam</a>), geological instability caused by changes to water levels during filling or poor surveying (<a href="/wiki/Vajont_Dam" title="Vajont Dam">Vajont</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malpasset" title="Malpasset">Malpasset</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Testalinden_Creek" title="Testalinden Creek">Testalinden Creek</a> dams), poor maintenance, especially of outlet pipes (<a href="/wiki/Lawn_Lake_Dam" title="Lawn Lake Dam">Lawn Lake Dam</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Val_di_Stava_Dam_collapse" title="Val di Stava Dam collapse">Val di Stava Dam collapse</a>), extreme rainfall (<a href="/wiki/Shakidor_Dam" title="Shakidor Dam">Shakidor Dam</a>), <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, and human, computer or design error (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Buffalo_Creek_Flood" title="Buffalo Creek Flood">Buffalo Creek Flood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dale_Dike_Reservoir" title="Dale Dike Reservoir">Dale Dike Reservoir</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taum_Sauk_pumped_storage_plant" title="Taum Sauk pumped storage plant">Taum Sauk pumped storage plant</a>).</p>
<p>A notable case of deliberate dam failure (prior to the above ruling) was the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="/wiki/No._617_Squadron_RAF" title="No. 617 Squadron RAF">'Dambusters'</a> raid on <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> (codenamed "<a href="/wiki/Operation_Chastise" title="Operation Chastise">Operation Chastise</a>"), in which three German dams were selected to be breached in order to damage German infrastructure and manufacturing and power capabilities deriving from the <a href="/wiki/Ruhr_(river)" title="Ruhr (river)">Ruhr</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eder" title="Eder">Eder</a> rivers. This raid later became the basis for several films.</p>
<p>Since 2007, the Dutch <a href="/wiki/IJkdijk" title="IJkdijk">IJkdijk</a> foundation is developing, with an <a href="/wiki/Open_innovation" title="Open innovation">open innovation</a> model and early warning system for levee/dike failures. As a part of the development effort, full-scale dikes are destroyed in the IJkdijk fieldlab. The destruction process is monitored by sensor networks from an international group of companies and scientific institutions.</p>
