<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2013:_Sixty-sixth_WHA">2013: Sixty-sixth WHA</span></h3>
<p>In her address to the 66th WHA in May 2013, WHO Director-General <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Chan" title="Margaret Chan">Margaret Chan</a> traced a brief history of revisions to the <a href="/wiki/International_Health_Regulations" title="International Health Regulations">International Health Regulations</a> following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SARS" title="SARS">SARS</a> outbreak in 2002-3, the "first severe new disease of the 21st century." She observed that the two new diseases WHO is dealing with in 2013 are the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus" title="Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus">novel coronavirus</a> (MERS), from the same family as SARS, detected in 2012 in <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, and the first-ever human infections with the H7N9 avian influenza virus reported in China in 2013. She attributed the positive report by the <i>World Health Statistics</i> (May 2013) on dramatic improvement in health in the world's poorest countries from 1993-2013, to the emphasis placed on poverty alleviation by the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a>.

<p>Dr Margaret Chan declared at the Assembly that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intellectual_Property" title="Intellectual Property">Intellectual Property</a>, or patents on strains of new virus, should not impede nations from protecting their citizens by limiting scientific investigations. Following the 2012 MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia, Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish raised concerns that scientists who applied for a patent would not allow the MERS-coronavirus to be used for investigations by other scientists and were therefore delaying the development of diagnostic tests. Ten of the 22 people who died and 22 of 44 cases reported were in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia–based microbiologist Ali Mohamed Zaki reported the first known case, a 60-year-old Saudi man who got sick in June, 2012 on ProMed-mail, a public health on-line forum then published more details including the virus’s genetic makeup and closest relatives. The Erasmus Medical Center "tested, sequenced and identified" a sample provided by Ali Mohamed Zaki. Erasmus MC and Dr. Zaki strongly refuted all allegations concerning a presumed lack of willingness to cooperate in research into the new MERS coronavirus, making diagnostic tests and virus specimens freely available to all research institutions around the globe.</p>
