<p><b>Wind</b> is the movement of <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gas</a>. On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">outer space</a>, <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a> is the movement of <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a> or charged particles from the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> through space, while <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Planetary_wind" title="Planetary wind">planetary wind</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Outgassing" title="Outgassing">outgassing</a> of light <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scale_(spatial)" title="Scale (spatial)">spatial scale</a>, their <a href="/wiki/Speed" title="Speed">speed</a>, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> occur on <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Meteorology" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed <a href="/wiki/Squall" title="Squall">squalls</a>. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/breeze" title="wikt:breeze">breeze</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gale" title="Gale">gale</a>, <a href="/wiki/Storm#Classification" title="Storm">storm</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricane</a>. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to <a href="/wiki/World" title="World">global</a> winds resulting from the difference in absorption of <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> between the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Climate_zone" title="Climate zone">climate zones</a> on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation" title="Atmospheric circulation">atmospheric circulation</a> are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">Coriolis effect</a>). Within the tropics, <a href="/wiki/Thermal_low" title="Thermal low">thermal low</a> circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a> circulations. In coastal areas the <a href="/wiki/Sea_breeze" title="Sea breeze">sea breeze</a>/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes_of_wind">Causes of wind</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">Atmospheric pressure</a></div>

<p>Wind is caused by differences in the <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>. When a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pressure_gradient_force" title="Pressure gradient force">difference in atmospheric pressure</a> exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">Coriolis effect</a>, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation" title="Atmospheric circulation">atmospheric circulation</a>) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> leading to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Buoyancy_force" title="Buoyancy force">buoyancy forces</a>) and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">rotation of the planet</a>. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geostrophic_balance" title="Geostrophic balance">geostrophic balance</a>. Near the Earth's surface, <a href="/wiki/Friction" title="Friction">friction</a> causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low pressure areas. A new, controversial theory suggests atmospheric gradients are caused by forest induced water condensation resulting in a positive feedback cycle of forests drawing moist air from the coastline.</p>
<p>Winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the decomposition and analysis of wind profiles. They are useful for simplifying the atmospheric <a href="/wiki/Equations_of_motion" title="Equations of motion">equations of motion</a> and for making qualitative arguments about the horizontal and vertical distribution of winds. The <a href="/wiki/Geostrophic_wind" title="Geostrophic wind">geostrophic wind</a> component is the result of the balance between Coriolis force and pressure gradient force. It flows parallel to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isobar_(meteorology)" title="Isobar (meteorology)">isobars</a> and approximates the flow above the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atmospheric_boundary_layer" title="Atmospheric boundary layer">atmospheric boundary layer</a> in the midlatitudes. The <a href="/wiki/Thermal_wind" title="Thermal wind">thermal wind</a> is the <i>difference</i> in the geostrophic wind between two levels in the atmosphere. It exists only in an atmosphere with horizontal <a href="/wiki/Temperature_gradient" title="Temperature gradient">temperature gradients</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Ageostrophy" title="Ageostrophy">ageostrophic wind</a> component is the difference between actual and geostrophic wind, which is responsible for air "filling up" cyclones over time. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gradient_wind" title="Gradient wind">gradient wind</a> is similar to the geostrophic wind but also includes <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_force" title="Centrifugal force">centrifugal force</a> (or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Centripetal_acceleration" title="Centripetal acceleration">centripetal acceleration</a>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measurement">Measurement</span></h2>


<p><a href="/wiki/Wind_direction" title="Wind direction">Wind direction</a> is usually expressed in terms of the direction from which it originates. For example, a <i>northerly</i> wind blows from the north to the south. <a href="/wiki/Weather_vane" title="Weather vane">Weather vanes</a> pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, <a href="/wiki/Windsock" title="Windsock">windsocks</a> indicate wind direction, and can also be used to estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by <a href="/wiki/Anemometer" title="Anemometer">anemometers</a>, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of <a href="/wiki/Ultrasound" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses <a href="/wiki/Pitot_tube" title="Pitot tube">pitot tubes</a> that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.</p>
<p>Sustained wind speeds are reported globally at a 10 meters (33 ft) height and are averaged over a 10‑minute time frame. The <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> reports winds over a 1‑minute average for tropical cyclones, and a 2‑minute average within weather observations. <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> typically reports winds over a 3‑minute average. Knowing the wind sampling average is important, as the value of a one-minute sustained wind is typically 14% greater than a ten-minute sustained wind. A short burst of high speed wind is termed a wind gust, one technical definition of a wind gust is: the maxima that exceed the lowest wind speed measured during a ten-minute time interval by 10 knots (19 km/h). A <a href="/wiki/Squall" title="Squall">squall</a> is a doubling of the wind speed above a certain threshold, which lasts for a minute or more.</p>
<p>To determine winds aloft, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rawinsondes" title="Rawinsondes">rawinsondes</a> determine wind speed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GPS" title="GPS">GPS</a>, <a href="/wiki/LORAN" title="LORAN">radio navigation</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a> tracking of the probe. Alternatively, movement of the parent <a href="/wiki/Weather_balloon" title="Weather balloon">weather balloon</a> position can be tracked from the ground visually using <a href="/wiki/Theodolite" title="Theodolite">theodolites</a>. <a href="/wiki/Remote_sensing" title="Remote sensing">Remote sensing</a> techniques for wind include <a href="/wiki/SODAR" title="SODAR">SODAR</a>, <a href="/wiki/Doppler_effect" title="Doppler effect">Doppler</a> <a href="/wiki/Lidar" title="Lidar">lidars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radars</a>, which can measure the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Doppler_shift" title="Doppler shift">Doppler shift</a> of <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> scattered or reflected off suspended <a href="/wiki/Aerosol" title="Aerosol">aerosols</a> or <a href="/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Radiometer" title="Radiometer">radiometers</a> and radars can be used to measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. <a href="/wiki/Wind_engineering" title="Wind engineering">Wind engineering</a> describes the study of the effects of the wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.</p>

<p>Historically, the <a href="/wiki/Beaufort_scale" title="Beaufort scale">Beaufort wind force scale</a> (created by <a href="/wiki/Francis_Beaufort" title="Francis Beaufort">Beaufort</a>) provides an empirical description of wind speed based on observed sea conditions. Originally it was a 13-level scale, but during the 1940s, the scale was expanded to 17 levels. There are general terms that differentiate winds of different average speeds such as a breeze, a gale, a storm, tornado, or a hurricane. Within the Beaufort scale, gale-force winds lie between 28 knots (52 km/h) and 55 knots (102 km/h) with preceding adjectives such as moderate, fresh, strong, and whole used to differentiate the wind's strength within the gale category. A storm has winds of 56 knots (104 km/h) to 63 knots (117 km/h). The terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another globally. Most ocean basins use the average wind speed to determine the tropical cyclone's category. Below is a summary of the classifications used by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Centre" title="Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre">Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers</a> worldwide:</p>

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_Scale" title="Enhanced Fujita Scale">Enhanced Fujita Scale</a> (EF Scale) rates the strength of tornadoes in the United States based on the damage they cause. Below is that scale.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Station_model" title="Station model">station model</a> plotted on surface <a href="/wiki/Weather_map" title="Weather map">weather maps</a> uses a wind barb to show both <a href="/wiki/Wind_direction" title="Wind direction">wind direction</a> and speed. The wind barb shows the speed using "flags" on the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each half of a flag depicts 5 knots (9.3 km/h) of wind.</li>
<li>Each full flag depicts 10 knots (19 km/h) of wind.</li>
<li>Each <a href="/wiki/Pennant_(commissioning)" title="Pennant (commissioning)">pennant</a> (filled triangle) depicts 50 knots (93 km/h) of wind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Winds are depicted as blowing from the direction the barb is facing. Therefore, a northeast wind will be depicted with a line extending from the cloud circle to the northeast, with flags indicating wind speed on the northeast end of this line. Once plotted on a map, an analysis of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isotach" title="Isotach">isotachs</a> (lines of equal wind speeds) can be accomplished. Isotachs are particularly useful in diagnosing the location of the jet stream on upper level constant pressure charts, and are usually located at or above the 300 hPa level.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wind_power">Wind power</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">Wind power</a></div>
<p>Wind energy is the <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of the air in motion. The kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass <i>m</i> with velocity <i>v</i> is given by <i>½ m v</i>. To find the mass of the packet passing through an area <i>A</i> perpendicular its velocity (which could be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time <i>t</i> has passed with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_density" title="Air density">air density</a> <i>ρ</i>, which gives us <i>m</i> = <i>A</i> <i>v</i> <i>t</i> <i>ρ</i>. So, we find that the total wind energy is:</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Derivative" title="Derivative">Differentiating</a> with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we find that the total wind <a href="/wiki/Power_(physics)" title="Power (physics)">power</a> is:</p>

<p>Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theoretical_power_captured_by_a_wind_turbine">Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine</span></h3>
<p>Total wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Stream_tube&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Stream tube (page does not exist)">stream tube</a>, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Betz%27_law" title="Betz' law">Betz' law</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Practical_wind_turbine_power">Practical wind turbine power</span></h3>
<p>Further insufficiencies, such as rotor blade <a href="/wiki/Friction" title="Friction">friction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drag_(physics)" title="Drag (physics)">drag</a>, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) proportional to the third power of velocity remains.</p>

These prevailing winds blow from the <a href="/wiki/West" title="West">west</a> to the <a href="/wiki/East" title="East">east</a>, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> and from the northwest in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest during the summer and when pressures are higher over the poles.</p>
<p>Together with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trade_wind" title="Trade wind">trade winds</a>, the westerlies enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies lead to the development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Western_intensification" title="Western intensification">western intensification</a>. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polar_region" title="Polar region">polar regions</a>. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the <a href="/wiki/Roaring_Forties" title="Roaring Forties">Roaring Forties</a>, between <a href="/wiki/40th_parallel_south" title="40th parallel south">40</a> and <a href="/wiki/50th_parallel_south" title="50th parallel south">50 degrees latitude south</a> of the equator.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sea_and_land_breezes">Sea and land breezes</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Sea_breeze" title="Sea breeze">Sea breeze</a></div>

<p>In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">sea</a> is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specific_heat" title="Specific heat">specific heat</a> compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the <a href="/wiki/Landform" title="Landform">land</a> rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea_level_pressure" title="Sea level pressure">sea level pressure</a>, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.</p>
<p>At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specific_heat" title="Specific heat">specific heat</a> values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Near_mountains">Near mountains</span></h3>

<p>Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above <a href="/wiki/Sea_level" title="Sea level">sea level</a>, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged <a href="/wiki/Topography" title="Topography">topography</a> that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys is the most important contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barrier_jet" title="Barrier jet">barrier jet</a>. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.</p>
<p>If there is a <a href="/wiki/Mountain_pass" title="Mountain pass">pass</a> in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bernoulli_principle" title="Bernoulli principle">Bernoulli principle</a> that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending <a href="/wiki/Airplane" title="Airplane">airplanes</a>. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names.

When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.</p>
<p>In mountainous areas, local distortion of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lee_waves" title="Lee waves">rotors</a>, which can be topped by <a href="/wiki/Lenticular_cloud" title="Lenticular cloud">lenticular clouds</a>. Strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Updraft" title="Updraft">updrafts</a>, downdrafts and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eddies" title="Eddies">eddies</a> develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a> occurs on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Windward" title="Windward">windward</a> side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as upslope flow, resulting in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adiabatic_lapse_rate" title="Adiabatic lapse rate">adiabatic</a> cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leeward" title="Leeward">leeward</a> or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a <a href="/wiki/Rain_shadow" title="Rain shadow">rain shadow</a> is observed. Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds are warm and dry. In Europe downwind of the <a href="/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>, they are known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foehn" title="Foehn">foehn</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, an example is the halny wiatr.

<p>As described earlier, prevailing and local winds are not spread evenly across the earth, which means that wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wind_power_density">Wind power density</span></h3>
<p>Nowadays, a yardstick used to determine the best locations for wind energy development is referred to as wind power density (WPD). It is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location, frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time. It takes into account wind velocity and mass. Color coded maps are prepared for a particular area are described as, for example, "mean annual power density at 50 meters." The results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab and referred to as "NREL CLASS." The larger the WPD calculation, the higher it is rated by class. At the end of 2008, worldwide <a href="/wiki/Nameplate_capacity" title="Nameplate capacity">nameplate capacity</a> of wind-powered generators was 120.8 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">gigawatts</a>. Although wind produced only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use in 2009, it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008. In several countries it has achieved relatively high levels of penetration, accounting for approximately 19% of electricity production in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark" title="Wind power in Denmark">Denmark</a>, 10% in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Spain" title="Wind power in Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Portugal" title="Wind power in Portugal">Portugal</a>, and 7% in <a href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Germany" title="Wind power in Germany">Germany</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wind_power_in_Ireland" title="Wind power in Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> in 2008.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" title="Wind shear">Wind shear</a></div>
<p>Wind shear, sometimes referred to as windshear or <a href="/wiki/Wind_gradient" title="Wind gradient">wind gradient</a>, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weather_fronts" title="Weather fronts">weather fronts</a> and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.</p>
<p>Wind shear itself is a <a href="/wiki/Microscale_meteorology" title="Microscale meteorology">microscale meteorological</a> phenomenon occurring over a very small distance, but it can be associated with <a href="/wiki/Mesoscale_meteorology" title="Mesoscale meteorology">mesoscale</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Synoptic_scale" title="Synoptic scale">synoptic scale</a> weather features such as <a href="/wiki/Squall_line" title="Squall line">squall lines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cold_front" title="Cold front">cold fronts</a>.

In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glider_aircraft" title="Glider aircraft">glider</a>. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ground_launch" title="Ground launch">ground launches</a>, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.</p>

<p>In arid climates, the main source of erosion is wind. The general wind circulation moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Aeolian_processes" title="Aeolian processes">Aeolian processes</a></div>
<p>Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dunes" title="Dunes">dunes</a>, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Friable" title="Friable">friable</a>, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, <a href="/wiki/Silt" title="Silt">silty</a>, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) <a href="/wiki/Sediment" title="Sediment">sediment</a>. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Desert_dust_migration">Desert dust migration</span></h3>
<p>During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> into southeastern North America. When dust from the <a href="/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_quality" title="Air quality">air quality</a> by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa.

Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of <a href="/wiki/Coral_reef" title="Coral reef">coral reefs</a> across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Seed_dispersal" title="Seed dispersal">Seed dispersal</a></div>
<p>Wind dispersal of seeds, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anemochory" title="Anemochory">anemochory</a>, is one of the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dandelion" title="Dandelion">dandelions</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Taraxacum" title="Taraxacum">Taraxacum</a></i> spp., <a href="/wiki/Asteraceae" title="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>), which have a feathery <a href="/wiki/Pappus_(flower_structure)" title="Pappus (flower structure)">pappus</a> attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and <a href="/wiki/Maple" title="Maple">maples</a> (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Acer_(genus)" title="Acer (genus)">Acer (genus)</a></i> spp., <a href="/wiki/Sapindaceae" title="Sapindaceae">Sapindaceae</a>), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for <a href="/wiki/Germination" title="Germination">germination</a>. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on <a href="/wiki/Island" title="Island">islands</a> tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many <a href="/wiki/Weed" title="Weed">weedy</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ruderal" title="Ruderal">ruderal</a> species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include <a href="/wiki/Tumbleweed" title="Tumbleweed">tumbleweeds</a>. A related process to anemochory is <a href="/wiki/Anemophily" title="Anemophily">anemophily</a>, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.</p>
<p>Wind also limits tree growth. On <a href="/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coasts</a> and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soils</a> through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as <a href="/wiki/Windthrow" title="Windthrow">windthrow</a>. This is most likely on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Windward" title="Windward">windward</a> slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to <a href="/wiki/Tree_stand" title="Tree stand">tree stands</a> that are 75 years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sitka_spruce" title="Sitka spruce">Sitka spruce</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coccoloba_uvifera" title="Coccoloba uvifera">sea grape</a>, are <a href="/wiki/Pruning" title="Pruning">pruned</a> back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.</p>
<p>Wind can also cause plants damage through <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Sand_abrasion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sand abrasion (page does not exist)">sand abrasion</a>. Strong winds will pick up loose sand and <a href="/wiki/Topsoil" title="Topsoil">topsoil</a> and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from 25 miles per hour (40 km/h) to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h). Such windblown sand causes extensive damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells, making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought. Using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting, scientists affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_Research_Service" title="Agricultural Research Service">Agricultural Research Service</a> studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings. The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems. After a period of four weeks the growth of the seedling once again became uniform throughout the plant, as it was before the windblown sand abrasion occurred.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">Cattle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sheep" title="Sheep">sheep</a> are prone to <a href="/wiki/Wind_chill" title="Wind chill">wind chill</a> caused by a combination of wind and cold temperatures, when winds exceed 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph), rendering their hair and wool coverings ineffective. Although <a href="/wiki/Penguin" title="Penguin">penguins</a> use both a layer of <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> to help guard against coldness in both water and air, their <a href="/wiki/Flipper_(anatomy)" title="Flipper (anatomy)">flippers</a> and feet are less immune to the cold. In the coldest climates such as <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emperor_penguin" title="Emperor penguin">emperor penguins</a> use <a href="/wiki/Kleptothermy" title="Kleptothermy">huddling</a> behavior to survive the wind and cold, continuously alternating the members on the outside of the assembled group, which reduces heat loss by 50%. Flying <a href="/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, a subset of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthropods" title="Arthropods">arthropods</a>, are swept along by the prevailing winds, while birds follow their own course taking advantage of wind conditions, in order to either fly or glide. As such, fine line patterns within <a href="/wiki/Weather_radar" title="Weather radar">weather radar</a> imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. Bird migration, which tends to occur overnight within the lowest 7,000 feet (2,100 m) of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, contaminates wind profiles gathered by weather radar, particularly the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WSR-88D" title="WSR-88D">WSR-88D</a>, by increasing the environmental wind returns by 15 knots (28 km/h) to 30 knots (56 km/h).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pika" title="Pika">Pikas</a> use a wall of pebbles to store dry plants and grasses for the winter in order to protect the food from being blown away. <a href="/wiki/Cockroach" title="Cockroach">Cockroaches</a> use slight winds that precede the attacks of potential <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Predator" title="Predator">predators</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Toad" title="Toad">toads</a>, to survive their encounters. Their <a href="/wiki/Cercus" title="Cercus">cerci</a> are very sensitive to the wind, and help them survive half of their attacks. <a href="/wiki/Elk" title="Elk">Elk</a> have a keen sense of smell that can detect potential upwind predators at a distance of 0.5 miles (800 m). Increases in wind above 15 kilometers per hour (9.3 mph) signals <a href="/wiki/Glaucous_gull" title="Glaucous gull">glaucous gulls</a> to increase their foraging and aerial attacks on thick-billed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Murres" title="Murres">murres</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sound_generation">Sound generation</span></h3>
<p>Wind causes the generation of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause a low level of <a href="/wiki/Environmental_noise" title="Environmental noise">environmental noise</a>. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.</p>

<p>High winds are known to cause damage, depending upon their strength. Infrequent wind gusts can cause poorly designed <a href="/wiki/Suspension_bridge" title="Suspension bridge">suspension bridges</a> to sway. When wind gusts are at a similar frequency to the swaying of the bridge, the bridge can be destroyed more easily, such as what occurred with the <a href="/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)" title="Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)">Tacoma Narrows Bridge</a> in 1940. Wind speeds as low as 23 knots (43 km/h) can lead to power outages due to tree branches disrupting the flow of energy through power lines. While no species of tree is guaranteed to stand up to hurricane-force winds, those with shallow roots are more prone to uproot, and brittle trees such as <a href="/wiki/Eucalyptus" title="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a>, sea <a href="/wiki/Hibiscus" title="Hibiscus">hibiscus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Avocado" title="Avocado">avocado</a> are more prone to damage. Hurricane-force winds cause substantial damage to mobile homes, and begin to structurally damage homes with foundations. Winds of this strength due to downsloped winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars. Once winds exceed 135 knots (250 km/h), homes completely collapse, and significant damage is done to larger buildings. Total destruction to man-made structures occurs when winds reach 175 knots (324 km/h). The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_scale" title="Saffir-Simpson scale">Saffir-Simpson scale</a> and <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale" title="Enhanced Fujita scale">Enhanced Fujita scale</a> were designed to help estimate wind speed from the damage caused by high winds related to tropical cyclones and <a href="/wiki/Tornado" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Australia's <a href="/wiki/Barrow_Island_(Western_Australia)" title="Barrow Island (Western Australia)">Barrow Island</a> holds the record for the strongest wind gust, reaching 408 km/h (253 mph) during tropical cyclone Olivia on 10 April 1996, surpassing the previous record of 372 km/h (231 mph) set on <a href="/wiki/Mount_Washington_(New_Hampshire)" title="Mount Washington (New Hampshire)">Mount Washington (New Hampshire)</a> on the afternoon of 12 April 1934. The most powerful gusts of wind on Earth were created by nuclear detonations. The blast wave is similar to a strong wind gust over the ground. The largest nuclear explosion (50–58 megatons at an altitude of about 13,000 feet (4,000 m)) generated a 20 bar blast pressure at ground zero, which is similar to a wind gust of 3,100 miles per hour (5,000 km/h).</p>
<p>Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Smoldering" title="Smoldering">smoldering</a> logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour <i>fire day</i> that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.</p>

<p>The solar wind is quite different from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Planetary_wind" title="Planetary wind">planetary wind</a> is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.</p>

<p>The hydrodynamic wind within the upper portion of a planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> to move up to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exobase" title="Exobase">exobase</a>, the lower limit of the <a href="/wiki/Exosphere" title="Exosphere">exosphere</a>, where the gases can then reach <a href="/wiki/Escape_velocity" title="Escape velocity">escape velocity</a>, entering <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">outer space</a> without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geologic_time" title="Geologic time">geologic time</a> causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a>.

The stream of particles varies in temperature and speed with the passage of time. These particles are able to escape the sun's <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, in part because of the high <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Corona" title="Corona">corona</a>, but also because of high <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> that particles gain through a process that is not well-understood. The solar wind creates the <a href="/wiki/Heliosphere" title="Heliosphere">Heliosphere</a>, a vast bubble in the <a href="/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a> surrounding the Solar System. Planets require large magnetic fields in order to reduce the ionization of their upper atmosphere by the solar wind.
