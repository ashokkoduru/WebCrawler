<p><b>Fat</b> is one of the three main <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macronutrients" title="Macronutrients">macronutrients</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>.<b></b> Fats, also known as <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglycerides</a>, are <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">esters</a> of three <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acid</a> chains and the <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> <a href="/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a>.</p>
<p>The terms "<a href="/wiki/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>", "fat", and "<a href="/wiki/Lipid" title="Lipid">lipid</a>" are often confused. "Oil" normally refers to a fat with short or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unsaturated_(hydrocarbon)" title="Unsaturated (hydrocarbon)">unsaturated</a> fatty acid chains that is liquid at <a href="/wiki/Room_temperature" title="Room temperature">room temperature</a>, while "fat" may specifically refer to fats that are solids at room temperature. "Lipid" is the general term, as a lipid is not necessarily a <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglyceride</a>. Fats, like other lipids, are generally <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrophobic" title="Hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a>, and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.</p>
<p>Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life, and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions. They are a necessary part of the <a href="/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" title="Diet (nutrition)">diet</a> of most <a href="/wiki/Heterotroph" title="Heterotroph">heterotrophs</a> (including humans). Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents. There are two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Essential_fatty_acids" title="Essential fatty acids">essential fatty acids</a> (EFAs) in human nutrition: <a href="/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid" title="Alpha-Linolenic acid">alpha-linolenic acid</a> (an <a href="/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid" title="Omega-3 fatty acid">omega-3 fatty acid</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Linoleic_acid" title="Linoleic acid">linoleic acid</a> (an <a href="/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid" title="Omega-6 fatty acid">omega-6 fatty acid</a>). Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats. Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called <a href="/wiki/Lipase" title="Lipase">lipases</a> produced in the <a href="/wiki/Pancreas" title="Pancreas">pancreas</a>.</p>
<p>Fats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain. Fats that are <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturated fats</a> have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain. <a href="/wiki/Unsaturated_fat" title="Unsaturated fat">Unsaturated fats</a> have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain. The nomenclature is based on the non-acid (non-carbonyl) end of the chain. This end is called the omega end or the n-end. Thus <a href="/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid" title="Alpha-Linolenic acid">alpha-linolenic acid</a> is called an <a href="/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid" title="Omega-3 fatty acid">omega-3 fatty acid</a> because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end. Some oils and fats have multiple double bonds and are therefore called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fats" title="Polyunsaturated fats">polyunsaturated fats</a>. Unsaturated fats can be further divided into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cis_fat" title="Cis fat">cis fats</a>, which are the most common in nature, and <a href="/wiki/Trans_fat" title="Trans fat">trans fats</a>, which are rare in nature. Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This action, called <a href="/wiki/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat. To make vegetable shortening, then, liquid <i>cis</i>-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40 °C), and store well, whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air. However, <a href="/wiki/Trans_fat" title="Trans fat">trans fats</a> are generated during hydrogenation as contaminants created by an unwanted side reaction on the catalyst during partial hydrogenation.</p>
<p>Saturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature. For example, animal fats <a href="/wiki/Tallow" title="Tallow">tallow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lard" title="Lard">lard</a> are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids. Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid.</p>
<p>Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 <a href="/wiki/Calorie" title="Calorie">food calories</a> (37 <a href="/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">kJ</a> = 8.8 <a href="/wiki/Calorie" title="Calorie">kcal</a>). Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glycerin" title="Glycerin">glycerol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a>. Glycerol itself can be converted to <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> by the liver and so become a source of energy.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_structure">Chemical structure</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">Triglyceride</a></div>

<p>There are many different kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure. All fats are derivatives of <a href="/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a>. Most fats are <a href="/wiki/Glyceride" title="Glyceride">glycerides</a>, particularly <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglycerides</a> (<a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">triesters</a> of glycerol). One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid (-COOH) with the alcohol; I.e. three chains per molecule. Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an -O- bond through <a href="/wiki/Condensation_reaction" title="Condensation reaction">dehydration synthesis</a>. This process is called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Esterification" title="Esterification">esterification</a> and fats are therefore <a href="/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">esters</a>. As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bond_angle" title="Bond angle">angles</a> of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E. The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol "backbone" would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines. Fats therefore have "ester" <a href="/wiki/Chemical_bond" title="Chemical bond">bonds</a>.</p>
<p>The properties of any specific fat molecule depend on the particular fatty acids that constitute it. Fatty acids form a family of compounds are composed of increasing numbers of carbon atoms linked into a zig-zag chain (hydrogen atoms to the side). The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid, the longer its chain will be. Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction (in this case, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Van_der_Waals_forces" title="Van der Waals forces">van der Waals forces</a>), and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature (<a href="/wiki/Melting_point" title="Melting point">melting point</a>).</p>

<p>Fatty acid chains may also differ by length, often categorized as short to very long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons (i.e. butyric acid).</li>
<li>Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6–12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.</li>
<li>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails 13 to 21 carbons.</li>
<li>Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails longer than 22 carbons</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short <a href="/wiki/Triformin" title="Triformin">triformin</a> to very long, e.g., cerotic acid, or <i>hexacosanoic acid</i>, a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid. Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow (lard) whose chains are 17 carbons long. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Importance_for_living_organisms">Importance for living organisms</span></h3>
<p>Fats are also sources of <a href="/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid" title="Essential fatty acid">essential fatty acids</a>, an important dietary requirement. They provide energy as noted above. <a href="/wiki/Vitamin" title="Vitamin">Vitamins</a> <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_A" title="Vitamin A">A</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_D" title="Vitamin D">D</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_E" title="Vitamin E">E</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_K" title="Vitamin K">K</a> are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats.</p>
<p>Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy <a href="/wiki/Skin" title="Skin">skin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hair" title="Hair">hair</a>, insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function.</p>
<p>Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as <a href="/wiki/Excretion" title="Excretion">excretion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urination" title="Urination">urination</a>, accidental or intentional <a href="/wiki/Bloodletting" title="Bloodletting">bloodletting</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sebum" title="Sebum">sebum</a> excretion, and <a href="/wiki/Hair" title="Hair">hair</a> growth.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adipose_tissue">Adipose tissue</span></h2>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Adipose_tissue" title="Adipose tissue">Adipose tissue</a></div>
<p>In animals, <a href="/wiki/Adipose_tissue" title="Adipose tissue">adipose</a>, or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. <a href="/wiki/Adipocyte" title="Adipocyte">Adipocytes</a> (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolism</a>. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the <a href="/wiki/Circulatory_system" title="Circulatory system">circulation</a>. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Insulin" title="Insulin">insulin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glucagon" title="Glucagon">glucagon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Epinephrine" title="Epinephrine">epinephrine</a>).</p>
<p>The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Visceral_fat" title="Visceral fat">visceral fat</a> is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subcutaneous_fat" title="Subcutaneous fat">subcutaneous fat</a>" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but <i>above</i> the abdominal muscle wall). Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a>), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is <a href="/wiki/Resistin" title="Resistin">resistin</a> which has been linked to obesity, <a href="/wiki/Insulin_resistance" title="Insulin resistance">insulin resistance</a>, and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fatty_acids_and_human_health">Fatty acids and human health</span></h2>
<p>Dietary consumption of fatty acids has effects on human health. Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with <i>cis</i> unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease. disease. For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the <a href="/wiki/Cochrane_Library" title="Cochrane Library">Cochrane Library</a> concluded: "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats."</p>
<p>Numerous studies have also found that consumption of <i>trans</i> fats increases risk of cardiovascular disease. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health" title="Harvard School of Public Health">Harvard School of Public Health</a> advises that replacing <i>trans</i> fats and saturated fats with <i>cis</i> monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health.</p>
