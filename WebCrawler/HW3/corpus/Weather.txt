<p><b>Weather</b> is the state of the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the <a href="/wiki/Troposphere" title="Troposphere">troposphere</a>, just below the <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a> activity, whereas <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies by <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropics</a>. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the <a href="/wiki/Jet_stream" title="Jet stream">jet stream</a>. Weather systems in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mid-latitudes" title="Mid-latitudes">mid-latitudes</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" title="Extratropical cyclone">extratropical cyclones</a>, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation" title="Earth's rotation">axis</a> is tilted relative to its orbital plane, <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's <a href="/wiki/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbit</a> can affect the amount and distribution of <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>.</p>
<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">atmosphere</a> for a future time and a given location. The system is a <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaotic system</a>; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes">Causes</span></h2>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, the common <a href="/wiki/List_of_meteorological_phenomena" title="List of meteorological phenomena">weather phenomena</a> include wind, <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">cloud</a>, rain, snow, <a href="/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dust_storm" title="Dust storm">dust storms</a>. Less common events include <a href="/wiki/Natural_disaster" title="Natural disaster">natural disasters</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Tornado" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricanes</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Typhoons" title="Typhoons">typhoons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Winter_storm" title="Winter storm">ice storms</a>. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and <a href="/wiki/Moisture" title="Moisture">moisture</a> differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">sun</a> angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the indirect <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>. The strong temperature contrast between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polar_region" title="Polar region">polar</a> and tropical air gives rise to the <a href="/wiki/Jet_stream" title="Jet stream">jet stream</a>. Weather <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Systems" title="Systems">systems</a> in the mid-latitudes, such as <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" title="Extratropical cyclone">extratropical cyclones</a>, are caused by instabilities of the <a href="/wiki/Jet_stream" title="Jet stream">jet stream</a> flow (see <a href="/wiki/Baroclinity" title="Baroclinity">baroclinity</a>). Weather systems in the tropics, such as <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" title="Monsoon">monsoons</a> or organized <a href="/wiki/Thunderstorm" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a> systems, are caused by different processes.</p>

<p>Because the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation" title="Earth's rotation">axis</a> is tilted relative to its orbital plane, <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">sun</a>, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Effect_of_sun_angle_on_climate" title="Effect of sun angle on climate">Effect of sun angle on climate</a>). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> received by the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> and influence long-term climate. (See <a href="/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" title="Milankovitch cycles">Milankovitch cycles</a>).</p>
<p>The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or <a href="/wiki/Frontogenesis" title="Frontogenesis">frontogenesis</a>) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which is explained by the <a href="/wiki/Lapse_rate" title="Lapse rate">lapse rate</a>. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an <a href="/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)" title="Inversion (meteorology)">inversion</a> and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of <a href="/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a> and often act as a <a href="/wiki/Capping_inversion" title="Capping inversion">cap</a> that <a href="/wiki/Convective_inhibition" title="Convective inhibition">suppresses</a> thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, <a href="/wiki/Ice" title="Ice">ice</a> sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as <a href="/wiki/Albedo" title="Albedo">reflectivity</a>, roughness, or moisture content.</p>
<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">air pressure</a>. The resulting horizontal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pressure_gradient_(atmospheric)" title="Pressure gradient (atmospheric)">pressure gradient</a> moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">Coriolis effect</a>. The simple systems thus formed can then display <a href="/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergent behaviour</a> to produce more <a href="/wiki/Pressure_system" title="Pressure system">complex systems</a> and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the <a href="/wiki/Hadley_cell" title="Hadley cell">Hadley cell</a> while a smaller scale example would be <a href="/wiki/Sea_breeze" title="Sea breeze">coastal breezes</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">atmosphere</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaotic system</a>, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. This makes it difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, though <a href="/wiki/Weather_forecasting" title="Weather forecasting">weather forecasters</a> are continually working to extend this limit through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scientific" title="Scientific">scientific</a> study of weather, <a href="/wiki/Meteorology" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>. It is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Predictions" title="Predictions">predictions</a> more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to <a href="/wiki/Potential" title="Potential">potential</a> for improved prediction skill.</p>

<p>Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> reactions that can affect the surface further (such as <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>), and sodium and chloride ions <a href="/wiki/Sea_salt" title="Sea salt">(salt)</a> deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a> of the surface.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Biometeorology#Human_biometeorology" title="Biometeorology">Biometeorology</a></div>
<p>Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_on_populations">Effects on populations</span></h3>

<p>Weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_world" title="History of the world">human history</a>. Aside from <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climatic changes</a> that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the <a href="/wiki/Desertification" title="Desertification">desertification</a> of the Middle East, and the formation of <a href="/wiki/Land_bridge" title="Land bridge">land bridges</a> during <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glacial" title="Glacial">glacial</a> periods), <a href="/wiki/Severe_weather" title="Severe weather">extreme weather</a> events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the <a href="/wiki/Mongols" title="Mongols">Mongol</a> fleet of <a href="/wiki/Kublai_Khan" title="Kublai Khan">Kublai Khan</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze_(typhoon)" title="Kamikaze (typhoon)">Kamikaze</a> winds in 1281. French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer <a href="/wiki/Fort_Caroline" title="Fort Caroline">Fort Caroline</a>. More recently, <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> redistributed over one million people from the central <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gulf_coast" title="Gulf coast">Gulf coast</a> elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest <a href="/wiki/Diaspora" title="Diaspora">diaspora</a> in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Little_Ice_Age" title="Little Ice Age">Little Ice Age</a> caused crop failures and <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famines</a> in Europe. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which about one-third of the Finnish population died.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Forecasting">Forecasting</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Weather_forecasting" title="Weather forecasting">Weather forecasting</a></div>

<p>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">atmosphere</a> for a future time and a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using <a href="/wiki/Meteorology" title="Meteorology">scientific understanding of atmospheric processes</a> to project how the atmosphere will evolve.</p>
<p>Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">barometric pressure</a>, current weather conditions, and sky condition, <a href="/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction" title="Numerical weather prediction">forecast models</a> are now used to determine future conditions. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, <a href="/wiki/Teleconnection" title="Teleconnection">teleconnections</a>, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaotic</a> nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the <i>range</i> of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a> are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the <a href="/wiki/Wind_chill" title="Wind chill">wind chill</a>, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modification">Modification</span></h2>
<p>The aspiration to <a href="/wiki/Weather_modification" title="Weather modification">control the weather</a> is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military <a href="/wiki/Operation_Popeye" title="Operation Popeye">Operation Popeye</a>, an attempt to disrupt <a href="/wiki/Military_supply_chain_management" title="Military supply chain management">supply lines</a> by lengthening the North Vietnamese <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a>. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve <a href="/wiki/Cloud_seeding" title="Cloud seeding">cloud seeding</a>; they include the <a href="/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a>- and low <a href="/wiki/Stratus_cloud" title="Stratus cloud">stratus</a> dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase <a href="/wiki/Snow" title="Snow">winter precipitation</a> over mountains, and techniques to suppress <a href="/wiki/Hail" title="Hail">hail</a>. A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the <a href="/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics" title="2008 Summer Olympics">2008 Summer Olympic Games</a>. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of <a href="/wiki/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in <a href="/wiki/Baoding" title="Baoding">Baoding</a> City of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hebei_Province" title="Hebei Province">Hebei Province</a>, to the southwest and Beijing's <a href="/wiki/Fangshan_District" title="Fangshan District">Fangshan District</a> recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.</p>

<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth. Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on Earth, but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition. The <a href="/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens" title="Cassini–Huygens">Cassini–Huygens</a> mission to <a href="/wiki/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a> discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic compounds</a>.
