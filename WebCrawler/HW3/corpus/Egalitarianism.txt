<p><b>Egalitarianism</b> (from <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> <i>égal</i>, meaning "equal")—or <b>equalitarianism</b>—is a trend of thought that favors <a href="/wiki/Social_equality" title="Social equality">equality</a> for all people. Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or <a href="/wiki/Social_status" title="Social status">social status</a>, according to the <i><a href="/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy" title="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a></i>. According to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Merriam-Webster_Dictionary" title="Merriam-Webster Dictionary">Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a>, the term has two distinct definitions in modern English: either as a political <a href="/wiki/Doctrine" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> that all people should be treated as equals and have the same <a href="/wiki/Political_freedom" title="Political freedom">political</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economic_freedom" title="Economic freedom">economic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_justice" title="Social justice">social</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights" title="Civil and political rights">civil rights</a>; or as a social philosophy advocating <a href="/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth" title="Redistribution of income and wealth">the removal of economic inequalities among people</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economic_egalitarianism" title="Economic egalitarianism">economic egalitarianism</a>, or the <a href="/wiki/Decentralization" title="Decentralization">decentralization of power</a>. Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_egalitarianism">Social egalitarianism</span></h3>
<p>At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_anarchism" title="Social anarchism">social anarchism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Libertarian_socialism" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Left-libertarianism" title="Left-libertarianism">left-libertarianism</a>, <a href="/wiki/One-nation_conservatism" title="One-nation conservatism">one-nation conservatism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Progressivism" title="Progressivism">progressivism</a>, some of which propound <a href="/wiki/Economic_egalitarianism" title="Economic egalitarianism">economic egalitarianism</a>. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among <a href="/wiki/Intellectualism" title="Intellectualism">intellectuals</a> and in the general populations of many countries. Whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice, however, remains a controversial question.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_egalitarianism">Economic egalitarianism</span></h4>
<p>An early example of equality-of-outcome economic egalitarianism is <a href="/wiki/Xu_Xing_(philosopher)" title="Xu Xing (philosopher)">Xu Xing</a>, a scholar of the Chinese philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Agriculturalism" title="Agriculturalism">Agriculturalism</a>, who supported the <a href="/wiki/Price_fixing" title="Price fixing">fixing of prices</a>, in which all similar goods and services, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Social_ownership" title="Social ownership">Social ownership</a> of <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> is sometimes considered to be a form of <i>economic egalitarianism</i> because, in an economy characterized by social ownership, the <a href="/wiki/Surplus_product" title="Surplus product">surplus product</a> generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. Marx did, however, have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific <a href="/wiki/Economic_system" title="Economic system">economic systems</a>.</p>
<p>The American economist <a href="/wiki/John_Roemer" title="John Roemer">John Roemer</a> has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of <a href="/wiki/Distributive_justice" title="Distributive justice">distributive justice</a>, shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that, according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be <a href="/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution" title="To each according to his contribution">proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production</a> is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religious_and_spiritual_egalitarianism">Religious and spiritual egalitarianism</span></h3>
<p><b>Sikhism</b></p>
<p>The Sikh faith was founded upon egalitarian principles, going beyond most faiths to provide equality not only based upon race but also gave equality to man and woman. This equality led to denunciation of sati - the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">funeral pyres</a> of deceased husbands - and provided women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christian_Egalitarianism" title="Christian Egalitarianism">Christian egalitarian</a> view holds that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes, and all age groups, but within the teachings and example of the male <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>, subject to a male deity <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>, and the overarching principles of scripture.</p>
<p>Within the wide range of <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups, some of which are <a href="/wiki/Complementarianism" title="Complementarianism">Complementarians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biblical_patriarchy" title="Biblical patriarchy">Patriarchalists</a>. There are also those who may say that, whilst the Bible encourages equality, it also encourages law and order and social structure (for example, parents having authority over their children, and the view that wife should submit to her husband). These ideas are considered by some to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism. At its foundation, <span class="nourlexpansion nowrap"><a class="external text" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A28&amp;version=NRSV" rel="nofollow">Galatians 3:28</a></span> holds that "There is neither Jew nor <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grecian" title="Grecian">Greek</a>, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"—defining all as equal in the sight of God. Similarly, <span class="nourlexpansion nowrap"><a class="external text" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A11&amp;version=NRSV" rel="nofollow">Colossians 3:11</a></span> says, "Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scythian" title="Scythian">Scythian</a>, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all", defining all as equal in the sight of God in relationship to faith in Jesus Christ. Various Christian groups have attempted to hold to this view and develop Christian oriented communities. In Acts, chapter 4, members of the early Christian community sell their possessions, give the proceeds to a common fund overseen by the disciples, then take 'according to their need'. One of the most notable of present-day communities are the <a href="/wiki/Hutterite" title="Hutterite">Hutterite</a> groups of <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, living in agricultural and collective communities.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Judaism">Judaism</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> is not a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universalist" title="Universalist">universalist</a> religion and teaches that <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a> (defined as either the biological descendants of <a href="/wiki/Jacob" title="Jacob">Jacob</a> "Israel", the son of Issac and grandson of <a href="/wiki/Abraham" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> or someone who converted) have a specific covenant with <a href="/wiki/God_in_Judaism" title="God in Judaism">God</a>, as a <a href="/wiki/Chosen_people" title="Chosen people">chosen people</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deutoronomy" title="Deutoronomy">Deutoronomy</a> 7:6 "chosen as God's <a href="/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people" title="Jews as the chosen people">treasured people</a>"), to serve as an example of <a href="/wiki/Divine_light" title="Divine light">God's light</a> to the rest of the world . The oral Torah and Rabbinic literature codified in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Babylonian_Talmud" title="Babylonian Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a> makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gentiles" title="Gentiles">gentiles</a> (literally, "the nations"). However <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Seven_Laws_of_Noah" title="The Seven Laws of Noah">the Seven Laws of Noah</a>. In this aspect Judaism is Universalist in its divine message but not in its religious obligations. In <a href="/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">Reform</a> and <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Judaism" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a>, egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Synagogues" title="Synagogues">Synagogues</a> that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating (i.e., no <a href="/wiki/Mechitza" title="Mechitza">mechitza</a>) and allow women to lead <a href="/wiki/Jewish_prayer" title="Jewish prayer">services</a> with men in attendance, as well as read publicly from the <a href="/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Islam">Islam</span></h4>
<p>The Islamic stance on equality is to some extent similar to that of Christianity (another universalist religion), and stresses that all humans are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_(social)" title="Class (social)">class</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Race_(human_classification)" title="Race (human classification)">race</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a> states, "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.". Louise Marlow's <i>Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought</i> compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Military_egalitarianism">Military egalitarianism</span></h3>
<p>Military egalitarianism has been noted since ancient times, such as with Shakespeare's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Crispin%27s_Day_Speech" title="St. Crispin's Day Speech">St. Crispin's Day Speech</a>. This occurs in spite of the distinctions military forces attempt to make between officers and enlisted men. For example, former Major General <a href="/wiki/Charles_J._Dunlap,_Jr." title="Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.">Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.</a> said that <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> culture included an egalitarianism bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Alexander_Berkman" title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> suggests:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>... equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity ... Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact ... Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality ... Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cultural_theory_of_risk" title="Cultural theory of risk">cultural theory of risk</a> holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules and principles, and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with <a href="/wiki/Fatalism" title="Fatalism">fatalism</a> termed as its opposite.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cultural_Theory_of_Risk" title="Cultural Theory of Risk">Cultural Theory of Risk</a> distinguishes between <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchists</a>, who are positive towards both rules and groups, and egalitarianists, who are positive towards groups but negative towards rules. This is by definition a form of "anarchist equality" as referred to by Berkman. The fabric of an "egalitarianist society" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit <a href="/wiki/Peer_pressure" title="Peer pressure">peer pressure</a> rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, <a href="/wiki/Individualism" title="Individualism">individualist</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fatalist" title="Fatalist">fatalist</a> or <a href="/wiki/Autonomism" title="Autonomism">autonomist</a>, will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to Cultural Theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles. Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marxism">Marxism</span></h3>
<p>Karl Marx and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> believed that a revolution would bring about a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist">socialist</a> society which would then eventually give way to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communist" title="Communist">communist</a> stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of "<a href="/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs" title="From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs">From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs</a>".</p>
<p>However, Marxism rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of "equality"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires. Thus, Marx's notion of <a href="/wiki/Communist_society" title="Communist society">communist society</a> is radically individualistic.</p>
<p>Marx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: "<a href="/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution" title="To each according to his contribution">To each according to his contribution</a>" and "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need" title="From each according to his ability, to each according to his need">from each according to their ability; to each according to their need</a>s". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with <i>distributive egalitarianism</i>, in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Equalism">Equalism</span></h3>

<p>Equalist is how many describe themselves since circa 1996, mostly outside the US who get distanced from the mainstream feminist movement, often citing extreme views as reason of not calling themselves feminist. In the western world, in both UK and US it's still just a small percentage of people declaring themselves as equalists, but the numbers are growing as scientists like research scientist Laura Waters and feminists join equalist groups due to mishandled cases and negative opinion about the main feminist movement. <a href="/wiki/Christina_Hoff_Sommers" title="Christina Hoff Sommers">Christina Hoff Sommers</a> is sometimes described as an equalist although she didn't call herself that on record.</p>
