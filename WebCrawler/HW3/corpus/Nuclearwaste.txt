<p>Radioactivity naturally decays over time, so radioactive waste has to be isolated and confined in appropriate disposal facilities for a sufficient period until it no longer poses a threat. The time radioactive waste must be stored for depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes. It can range from a few days for highly radioactive isotopes to millions of years for slightly radioactive ones. Current major approaches to managing radioactive waste have been segregation and storage for short-lived waste, near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate level waste, and <a href="/wiki/Deep_geological_repository" title="Deep geological repository">deep burial</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">partitioning / transmutation</a> for the high-level waste.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nature_and_significance_of_radioactive_waste">Nature and significance of radioactive waste</span></h2>
<p>Radioactive waste typically comprises a number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radionuclides" title="Radionuclides">radionuclides</a>: unstable configurations of elements that <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">decay</a>, emitting <a href="/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" title="Ionizing radiation">ionizing radiation</a> which can be harmful to humans and the environment. Those isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation, which last for different periods of time.</p>

<p>The radioactivity of all radioactive waste diminishes with time. All radionuclides contained in the waste have a <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a>—the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another <a href="/wiki/Nuclide" title="Nuclide">nuclide</a>—and eventually all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Stable_nuclide" title="Stable nuclide">stable nuclides</a>). Certain radioactive elements (such as <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>) will remain hazardous to humans and other creatures for hundreds or thousands of years. Other radionuclides remain radioactive for millions of years (though most of these products have so little activity as a result of their long half-lives that their radiation is lost in the <a href="/wiki/Background_radiation" title="Background radiation">background level</a>). Thus, these wastes must be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living <a href="/wiki/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">environment</a> for millennia. Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like <a href="/wiki/Iodine-129" title="Iodine-129">iodine-129</a> will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like <a href="/wiki/Iodine-131" title="Iodine-131">iodine-131</a>. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their <a href="/wiki/Fission_product_yield" title="Fission product yield">radiation yield</a> as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.</p>
<p>The energy and the type of the <a href="/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" title="Ionizing radiation">ionizing radiation</a> emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">element</a> will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Contaminate" title="Contaminate">contaminate</a> humans. This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive <a href="/wiki/Decay_product" title="Decay product">decay products</a> within a <a href="/wiki/Decay_chain" title="Decay chain">decay chain</a> before ultimately reaching a stable state.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pharmacokinetics">Pharmacokinetics</span></h3>

<p>Exposure to radioactive waste may cause serious harm or death. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humans" title="Humans">humans</a>, a dose of 1 <a href="/wiki/Sievert" title="Sievert">sievert</a> carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and this risk is assumed to be <a href="/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model" title="Linear no-threshold model">linearly proportional to dose</a> even for low doses. Ionizing radiation causes deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unborn_child" title="Unborn child">unborn child</a> is irradiated, it is possible a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Birth_defect" title="Birth defect">birth defect</a> may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a <a href="/wiki/Gamete" title="Gamete">gamete</a> or a gamete-forming <a href="/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a>. The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA, mRNA and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide—apoptosis</p>
<p>Depending on the decay mode and the <a href="/wiki/Pharmacokinetics" title="Pharmacokinetics">pharmacokinetics</a> <a href="/wiki/Radiopharmacology" title="Radiopharmacology">of an element</a> (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioisotope" title="Radioisotope">radioisotope</a> will differ. For instance <a href="/wiki/Iodine-131" title="Iodine-131">iodine-131</a> is a short-lived <a href="/wiki/Beta_decay" title="Beta decay">beta</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gamma_decay" title="Gamma decay">gamma</a> emitter, but because it concentrates in the <a href="/wiki/Thyroid" title="Thyroid">thyroid</a> gland, it is more able to cause injury than <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a>-137 which, being <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_soluble" title="Water soluble">water soluble</a>, is rapidly excreted in urine. In a similar way, the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_decay" title="Alpha decay">alpha</a> emitting actinides and <a href="/wiki/Radium" title="Radium">radium</a> are considered very harmful as they tend to have long <a href="/wiki/Biological_half-life" title="Biological half-life">biological half-lives</a> and their radiation has a high <a href="/wiki/Relative_biological_effectiveness" title="Relative biological effectiveness">relative biological effectiveness</a>, making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, time of exposure and sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sources_of_waste">Sources of waste</span></h2>
<p>Radioactive waste comes from a number of sources. In countries with nuclear power plants, nuclear armament, or nuclear fuel treatment plants, the majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing, otherwise there is no waste of nuclear origin. Other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil and gas, and some minerals, as discussed below.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nuclear_fuel_cycle">Nuclear fuel cycle</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Front_end">Front end</span></h4>
<p>Waste from the front end of the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_cycle" title="Nuclear fuel cycle">nuclear fuel cycle</a> is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Uranium_dioxide" title="Uranium dioxide">Uranium dioxide</a> (UO<sub>2</sub>) concentrate from mining is not very radioactive – only a thousand or so times as radioactive as the <a href="/wiki/Granite" title="Granite">granite</a> used in buildings. It is refined from <a href="/wiki/Yellowcake" title="Yellowcake">yellowcake</a> (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), then converted to <a href="/wiki/Uranium_hexafluoride" title="Uranium hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> gas (UF<sub>6</sub>). As a gas, it undergoes <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">enrichment</a> to increase the <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">U-235</a> content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard <a href="/wiki/Ceramic" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a> oxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.</p>
<p>The main by-product of enrichment is <a href="/wiki/Depleted_uranium" title="Depleted uranium">depleted uranium</a> (DU), principally the <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">U-238</a> isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF<sub>6</sub> or as U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-tank" title="Anti-tank">anti-tank</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/KE-penetrator" title="KE-penetrator">shells</a>, even sailboat <a href="/wiki/Keel" title="Keel">keels</a> on at least <a href="/wiki/Pen_Duick" title="Pen Duick">one occasion</a>. It is also used with plutonium for making <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mixed_oxide_fuel" title="Mixed oxide fuel">mixed oxide fuel</a> (MOX) and to dilute, or <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium#Downblending" title="Enriched uranium">downblend</a>, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Back_end">Back end</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">Nuclear reprocessing</a></div>
<p>The back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fuel_rod" title="Fuel rod">fuel rods</a>, contains <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a> that emit beta and gamma radiation, and <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a> that emit <a href="/wiki/Alpha_particle" title="Alpha particle">alpha particles</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Uranium-234" title="Uranium-234">uranium-234</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neptunium-237" title="Neptunium-237">neptunium-237</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-238" title="Plutonium-238">plutonium-238</a> and <a href="/wiki/Americium-241" title="Americium-241">americium-241</a>, and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as <a href="/wiki/Californium" title="Californium">californium</a> (Cf). These isotopes are formed in <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactors</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">reprocessing</a> of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission (see high level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called <a href="/wiki/Neutron_poison" title="Neutron poison">neutron poisons</a> in this context. These eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed. At that point the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">uranium-235</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> present. In the United States, this used fuel is usually "stored", while in other countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products, and the fuel can then be re-used, thus cutting costs, reducing health risks, saving time, and in general being far safer. The fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. While these countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is the only country known to be planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fuel_composition_and_long_term_radioactivity">Fuel composition and long term radioactivity</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">Spent nuclear fuel</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_level_waste" title="High level waste">High level waste</a></div>


<p>Long-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> (SNF). When looking at long term radioactive decay, the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_technology" title="Nuclear reactor technology">nuclear reactor</a> is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.</p>
<p>An example of this effect is the use of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel" title="Nuclear fuel">nuclear fuels</a> with <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>. Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile <a href="/wiki/Uranium-233" title="Uranium-233">U-233</a>. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_decay" title="Radioactive decay">activity</a> curve of the SNF around 1 million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the figure on the top right.</p>
<p>The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and <a href="/wiki/MOX_fuel" title="MOX fuel">Mixed Oxide fuel</a> (MOX). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around 1 million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed.</p>
<p>The use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different SNF composition, with varying activity curves.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Proliferation_concerns">Proliferation concerns</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">Nuclear proliferation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reactor-grade_plutonium" title="Reactor-grade plutonium">Reactor-grade plutonium</a></div>
<p>Since uranium and plutonium are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> materials, there have been proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>), plutonium is <a href="/wiki/Reactor-grade_plutonium" title="Reactor-grade plutonium">reactor-grade plutonium</a>. In addition to <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-239" title="Plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-240" title="Plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-241" title="Plutonium-241">plutonium-241</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-238" title="Plutonium-238">plutonium-238</a>. These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g. uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).</p>
<p>High-level waste is full of highly radioactive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a>, most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in <a href="/wiki/Deep_geological_repository" title="Deep geological repository">deep geological storage</a>, over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become "plutonium mines", from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, the high radioactivity and heat (80 C in surrounding rock) greatly increases the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.</p>
<p>Pu-239 decays to <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235" title="Uranium-235">U-235</a> which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life (roughly 10 years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a <a href="/wiki/Denaturation_(fissile_materials)" title="Denaturation (fissile materials)">denaturation</a> agent for any U-235 produced by plutonium decay.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_reactor" title="Fast reactor">fast reactors</a>. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">pyrometallurgical fast reactors</a>, the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nuclear_weapons_decommissioning">Nuclear weapons decommissioning</span></h3>
<p>Waste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than <a href="/wiki/Tritium" title="Tritium">tritium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Americium" title="Americium">americium</a>. It is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.</p>
<p>In the past the neutron trigger for an <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">atomic bomb</a> tended to be <a href="/wiki/Beryllium" title="Beryllium">beryllium</a> and a high activity alpha emitter such as <a href="/wiki/Polonium" title="Polonium">polonium</a>; an alternative to polonium is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pu-238" title="Pu-238">Pu-238</a>. For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern bombs are normally not released to the open literature.</p>
<p>Some designs might contain a <a href="/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" title="Radioisotope thermoelectric generator">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a> using Pu-238 to provide a long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.</p>
<p>It is likely that the fissile material of an old bomb which is due for refitting will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it, these are likely to include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U-236" title="U-236">U-236</a> from Pu-240 impurities, plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) than the Pu-239 itself.</p>
<p>The beta decay of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pu-241" title="Pu-241">Pu-241</a> forms <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Am-241" title="Am-241">Am-241</a>; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of <a href="/wiki/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a>. The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing#Non_aqueous_methods" title="Nuclear reprocessing">pyrochemical</a> processes and aqueous/organic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solvent_extraction" title="Solvent extraction">solvent extraction</a>. A truncated <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a> type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation. Naturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3% of U-238 and only 0.7% of U-235.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Legacy_waste">Legacy waste</span></h3>
<p>Due to historic activities typically related to radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, there are numerous sites that contain or are contaminated with radioactivity. In the United States alone, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">Department of Energy</a> states there are "millions of gallons of radioactive waste" as well as "thousands of tons of <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> and material" and also "huge quantities of contaminated soil and water." Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fernald,_Ohio" title="Fernald, Ohio">Fernald</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> site for example had "31 million pounds of uranium product", "2.5 billion pounds of waste", "2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris", and a "223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards." The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres. DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, using the recently developed method of <a href="/wiki/Geomelting" title="Geomelting">geomelting</a>, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, there were for example at least "167 known contaminant release sites" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150 km) site. Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.</p>

<p>TENORM is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste, though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Coal">Coal</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">Coal</a> contains a small amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_crust" title="Earth's crust">Earth's crust</a>. The surrounding strata, if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of 'dirty' coals. The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the <a href="/wiki/Fly_ash" title="Fly ash">fly ash</a> precisely because they do not burn well. The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black <a href="/wiki/Shale" title="Shale">shale</a> and is less than <a href="/wiki/Phosphate" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a> rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled. According to U.S. <a href="/wiki/National_Council_on_Radiation_Protection_and_Measurements" title="National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements">NCRP</a> reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Person-rem/year" title="Person-rem/year">person-rem/year</a> for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year). (The exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining to waste disposal is 136 person-rem/year; the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is "probably unknown".)</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Oil_and_gas">Oil and gas</span></h4>
<p>Residues from the <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">gas</a> industry often contain radium and its decay products. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich, while the water, oil and gas from a well often contain <a href="/wiki/Radon" title="Radon">radon</a>. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where <a href="/wiki/Propane" title="Propane">propane</a> is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.</p>

<p><b><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_level_waste" title="Low level waste">Low level waste</a></b> (<b>LLW</b>) is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_cycle" title="Nuclear fuel cycle">nuclear fuel cycle</a>. Low-level wastes include <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>, rags, <a href="/wiki/Tool" title="Tool">tools</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clothing" title="Clothing">clothing</a>, filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block.</p>
<p>Some high-activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low-level waste is divided into four classes: <b>class A</b>, <b>class B</b>, <b>class C</b>, and <b>Greater Than Class C</b> (<b>GTCC</b>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intermediate-level_waste">Intermediate-level waste</span></h3>

<p><b>Intermediate-level waste</b> (<b>ILW</b>) contains higher amounts of radioactivity and in general require shielding, but not cooling.

It may be solidified in <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitumen" title="Bitumen">bitumen</a> for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">fuel reprocessing</a>) is deposited in <a href="/wiki/Deep_geological_repository" title="Deep geological repository">geological repository</a>. U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="High-level_waste">High-level waste</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/High-level_waste" title="High-level waste">High-level waste</a></b> (<b>HLW</b>) is produced by nuclear reactors. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and is removed from the core, it is considered HLW. Fuel rods contain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic_element" title="Transuranic element">transuranic elements</a> generated in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactor_core" title="Reactor core">reactor core</a>. Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95 percent of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">electricity generation</a>. The amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metric_ton" title="Metric ton">metric tons</a> every year, which is the equivalent to about 100 <a href="/wiki/Double-decker_bus" title="Double-decker bus">double-decker buses</a> or a two-story structure with a footprint the size of a <a href="/wiki/Basketball_court" title="Basketball court">basketball court</a>. A 1000-<a href="/wiki/Watt" title="Watt">MW</a> nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. In 2010, there was very roughly estimated to be stored some 250,000 tons of nuclear HLW, that does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. Japan estimated to hold 17,000 tons of HLW in storage in 2015. HLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed, and in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.</p>
<p>The ongoing controversy over <a href="/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_management" title="High-level radioactive waste management">high-level radioactive waste disposal</a> is a major constraint on the nuclear power’s global expansion. Most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. However, almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy began, no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian high-level nuclear waste, although Finland is in the advanced stage of the construction of such facility, the <a href="/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository" title="Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository">Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository</a>. Reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active development still generate waste and so are not a total solution, but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste, and there are many such active programs worldwide. Deep geological burial remains the only responsible way to deal with high-level nuclear waste. The <a href="/wiki/Morris_Operation" title="Morris Operation">Morris Operation</a> is currently the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transuranic_waste">Transuranic waste</span></h3>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Transuranic_waste" title="Transuranic waste">Transuranic waste</a></b> (<b>TRUW</b>) as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with <a href="/wiki/Alpha_particle" title="Alpha particle">alpha</a>-emitting transuranic <a href="/wiki/Radionuclide" title="Radionuclide">radionuclides</a> with <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-lives</a> greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100 <a href="/wiki/Curie" title="Curie">nCi</a>/g (3.7 <a href="/wiki/Becquerel" title="Becquerel">MBq</a>/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic ("beyond uranium"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">weapons</a> production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>).</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, transuranic waste is further categorized into "contact-handled" (CH) and "remote-handled" (RH) on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mrem" title="Mrem">mrem</a> per hour (2 mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200 mrem/h (2 mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000  mrem/h (10,000 mSv/h). The U.S. currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the <a href="/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant" title="Waste Isolation Pilot Plant">Waste Isolation Pilot Plant</a> (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Prevention_of_waste">Prevention of waste</span></h2>

<p>Of particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions.</p>
<p>In second half of 20th century, several methods of disposal of radioactive waste were investigated by nuclear nations, which are :</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Initial_treatment_of_waste">Initial treatment of waste</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vitrification">Vitrification</span></h4>
<p>Long-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized that one way to do this might be through <a href="/wiki/Vitrification" title="Vitrification">vitrification</a>. Currently at <a href="/wiki/Sellafield" title="Sellafield">Sellafield</a> the high-level waste (<a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a> first cycle <a href="/wiki/Raffinate" title="Raffinate">raffinate</a>) is mixed with <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> and then calcined. <a href="/wiki/Calcination" title="Calcination">Calcination</a> involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste, and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.</p>
<p>The 'calcine' generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented <a href="/wiki/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a>. The resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into <a href="/wiki/Stainless_steel" title="Stainless steel">stainless steel</a> cylindrical containers ("cylinders") in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies ("vitrifies") into the glass. After being formed, the glass is highly resistant to water.</p>
<p>After filling a cylinder, a seal is <a href="/wiki/Welding" title="Welding">welded</a> onto the cylinder head. The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products are expected to be immobilized for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using <a href="/wiki/Hot_cell" title="Hot cell">hot cell</a> systems. Sugar is added to control the <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium" title="Ruthenium">ruthenium</a> chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile <a href="/wiki/Ruthenium_tetroxide" title="Ruthenium tetroxide">RuO<sub>4</sub></a> containing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ru-106" title="Ru-106">radioactive ruthenium isotopes</a>. In the West, the glass is normally a <a href="/wiki/Borosilicate_glass" title="Borosilicate glass">borosilicate glass</a> (similar to <a href="/wiki/Pyrex" title="Pyrex">Pyrex</a>), while in the former <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> bloc it is normal to use a <a href="/wiki/Phosphate_glass" title="Phosphate glass">phosphate glass</a>. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (<a href="/wiki/Palladium" title="Palladium">palladium</a>, the other Pt group metals, and <a href="/wiki/Tellurium" title="Tellurium">tellurium</a>) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ion_exchange">Ion exchange</span></h4>
<p>It is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with <a href="/wiki/Ion_exchange" title="Ion exchange">ion exchange</a> or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a <a href="/wiki/Ferric" title="Ferric">ferric</a> <a href="/wiki/Hydroxide" title="Hydroxide">hydroxide</a> <a href="/wiki/Flocculation" title="Flocculation">floc</a> to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Fly_ash" title="Fly ash">fly ash</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Blast_furnace" title="Blast furnace">blast furnace</a> <a href="/wiki/Slag" title="Slag">slag</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Portland_cement" title="Portland cement">Portland cement</a>, instead of normal <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Synroc">Synroc</span></h4>
<p>The Australian <a href="/wiki/Synroc" title="Synroc">Synroc</a> (synthetic rock) is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes).

<p>The time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Above-ground_disposal">Above-ground disposal</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dry_cask_storage" title="Dry cask storage">Dry cask storage</a> typically involves taking waste from a <a href="/wiki/Spent_fuel_pool" title="Spent fuel pool">spent fuel pool</a> and sealing it (along with an <a href="/wiki/Inert_gas" title="Inert gas">inert gas</a>) in a <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> cylinder, which is placed in a <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Geologic_disposal">Geologic disposal</span></h4>

<p>The process of selecting appropriate <a href="/wiki/Deep_geological_repository" title="Deep geological repository">deep final repositories</a> for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore <a href="/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine" title="Tunnel boring machine">tunnel boring machines</a> (similar to those used to drill the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" title="Channel Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> from England to France) to drill a shaft 500 metres (1,600 ft) to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate <a href="/wiki/Stewardship_cessation" title="Stewardship cessation">stewardship cessation</a> of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.</p>
<p>Because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country's estimate of several hundred thousand years—perhaps up to one million years—being necessary for waste isolation "fully justified."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ocean_floor_disposal" title="Ocean floor disposal">Ocean floor disposal</a> of radioactive waste has been suggested by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded over a period of 25 years. They include burial beneath a stable <a href="/wiki/Abyssal_plain" title="Abyssal plain">abyssal plain</a>, burial in a <a href="/wiki/Subduction" title="Subduction">subduction</a> zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the <a href="/wiki/Mantle_(geology)" title="Mantle (geology)">Earth's mantle</a>, and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste, they would require an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basic_Law" title="Basic Law">amendment</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" title="United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea">Law of the Sea</a>.</p>
<p>Article 1 (Definitions), 7., of the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, (the London Dumping Convention) states:</p>

<p>The proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a <a href="/wiki/Subduction" title="Subduction">subduction</a> zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as the state-of-the-art as of 2001 in nuclear waste disposal technology. Another approach termed Remix &amp; Return would blend high-level waste with <a href="/wiki/Uranium_mining" title="Uranium mining">uranium mine</a> and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the <a href="/wiki/Uraninite" title="Uraninite">uranium ore</a>, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence in it of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Deep_borehole_disposal" title="Deep borehole disposal">Deep borehole disposal</a> is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes. Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment. The Earth's crust contains 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium (primarily <a href="/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust" title="Abundance of elements in Earth's crust">at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each</a> adding up over the crust's 3 * 10 ton mass), among other natural radioisotopes. Since the fraction of nuclides decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to an isotope's half-life, the relative radioactivity of the lesser amount of human-produced radioisotopes (thousands of tons instead of trillions of tons) would diminish once the isotopes with far shorter half-lives than the bulk of natural radioisotopes decayed.</p>
<p>In January 2013, <a href="/wiki/Cumbria" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> <a href="/wiki/County_council" title="County council">county council</a> rejected UK central government proposals to start work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste near to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lake_District_National_Park" title="Lake District National Park">Lake District National Park</a>. "For any host community, there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds" said Ed Davey, Energy Secretary, but nonetheless, the local elected body voted 7–3 against research continuing, after hearing evidence from independent geologists that "the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia."</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transmutation">Transmutation</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">Nuclear transmutation</a></div>
<p>There have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful nuclear waste. In particular, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="Integral Fast Reactor">Integral Fast Reactor</a> was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests, but was then canceled by the US Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate <a href="/wiki/Subcritical_reactor" title="Subcritical reactor">subcritical reactors</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">transmutation</a> of the left-over transuranic elements.</p>
<p>An isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is Pu-239. The estimated world total of plutonium in the year 2000 was of 1,645 metric tons, of which 210 metric tons had been separated by reprocessing. The large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program. An option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional Light Water Reactor (LWR). Several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study.</p>
<p>Transmutation was banned in the US in April 1977 by President Carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation, but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981. Due to the economic losses and risks, construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a>. This has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called <a href="/wiki/SCK%E2%80%A2CEN" title="SCK•CEN">Myrrha</a> in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">EU</a> to make transmutation possible on a large, industrial scale. According to President Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) of 2007, the US is now actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.</p>
<p>There have also been theoretical studies involving the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fusion_reactor" title="Fusion reactor">fusion reactors</a> as so called "actinide burners" where a fusion reactor <a href="/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> such as in a <a href="/wiki/Tokamak" title="Tokamak">tokamak</a>, could be "doped" with a small amount of the "minor" transuranic atoms which would be transmuted (meaning fissioned in the actinide case) to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of <a href="/wiki/Deuterium" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tritium" title="Tritium">tritium</a> in the reactor. A study at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT" title="MIT">MIT</a> found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Thermonuclear_Experimental_Reactor" title="International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor">International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor</a> (ITER) could transmute the entire annual <a href="/wiki/Minor_actinide" title="Minor actinide">minor actinide</a> production from all of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactors</a> presently operating in the <a href="/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors#Power_station_reactors_18" title="List of nuclear reactors">United States fleet</a> while simultaneously generating approximately 1 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatt" title="Gigawatt">gigawatt</a> of power from each reactor.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Re-use_of_waste">Re-use of waste</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">Nuclear reprocessing</a></div>
<p>Another option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Re-use" title="Re-use">re-use</a> them. Already, <a href="/wiki/Caesium-137" title="Caesium-137">caesium-137</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strontium-90" title="Strontium-90">strontium-90</a> and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as <a href="/wiki/Food_irradiation" title="Food irradiation">food irradiation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators" title="Radioisotope thermoelectric generators">radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a>. While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it reduces the quantity of waste produced.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent application 2,659,302, is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an <a href="/wiki/Unconventional_oil" title="Unconventional oil">unconventional oil</a> formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">Breeder reactors</a> can run on U-238 and transuranic elements, which comprise the majority of spent fuel radioactivity in the 1,000–100,000-year time span.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Space_disposal">Space disposal</span></h4>
<p>Space disposal is attractive because it removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, such as the potential for catastrophic failure of a <a href="/wiki/Launch_vehicle" title="Launch vehicle">launch vehicle</a>, which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed of. This makes the proposal impractical economically and it increases the risk of at least one or more launch failures. To further complicate matters, international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established. Costs and inadequate reliability of modern rocket launch systems for space disposal has been one of the motives for interest in <a href="/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch" title="Non-rocket spacelaunch">non-rocket space launch</a> systems such as <a href="/wiki/Mass_driver#On_Earth" title="Mass driver">mass drivers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Space_elevator" title="Space elevator">space elevators</a>, and other proposals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="National_management_plans">National management plans</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_management" title="High-level radioactive waste management">High-level radioactive waste management</a></div>
<p>Most countries are considerably ahead of the United States in developing plans for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Sweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste. "An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium."</p>
<p>In many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for <a href="/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository" title="Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository">Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a> for the first 10,000 years after closure.</p>
<p>The U.S. EPA's proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of a maximum of 3.5 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Millisievert" title="Millisievert">millisieverts</a> (350 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Millirem" title="Millirem">millirem</a>) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which would be up to several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the U.S. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">DOE</a> predicted that <a href="/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository#Opposition" title="Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository">received dose would be much below that limit</a>. Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> (10 million km) by <a href="/wiki/Approximation#Mathematics" title="Approximation">≈</a> 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Natural_radioactivity" title="Natural radioactivity">natural radioisotopes</a> in such a volume, but the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mongolia">Mongolia</span></h4>
<p>After serious opposition had arisen about plans and negotiations between <a href="/wiki/Mongolia" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> with Japan and the United States of America to build nuclear-waste facilities in Mongolia, Mongolia stopped all negotiations in September 2011. These negotiations had started after U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Poneman" title="Daniel Poneman">Daniel B. Poneman</a> visited Mongolia in September, 2010. Talks took place in Washington DC between officials of Japan, the United States and Mongolia in February 2011. After this the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE), which wanted to buy nuclear fuel from Mongolia, joined in the negotiations. The talks were kept secret, and although The <a href="/wiki/Mainichi_Shimbun" title="Mainichi Shimbun"><i>Mainichi Daily News</i></a> reported on them in May, Mongolia officially denied the existence of these negotiations. However, alarmed by this news, Mongolian citizens protested against the plans, and demanded the government withdraw the plans and disclose information. The Mongolian President <a href="/wiki/Tsakhiagiin_Elbegdorj" title="Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj">Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj</a> issued a presidential order on September 13 banning all negotiations with foreign governments or international organizations on nuclear-waste storage plans in Mongolia. The Mongolian government has accused the newspaper of distributing false claims around the world. After the presidential order, the Mongolian president fired the individual who was supposedly involved in these conversations.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Illegal_dumping">Illegal dumping</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Toxic_waste_dumping_by_the_%27Ndrangheta" title="Toxic waste dumping by the 'Ndrangheta">Toxic waste dumping by the 'Ndrangheta</a></div>
<p>Authorities in Italy are investigating a <a href="/wiki/%27Ndrangheta" title="'Ndrangheta">'Ndrangheta</a> mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste. According to a <a href="/wiki/Whistleblower" title="Whistleblower">whistleblower</a>, a manager of the Italy's state energy research agency <a href="/wiki/ENEA_(Italy)" title="ENEA (Italy)">Enea</a> paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with <a href="/wiki/Somalia" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, and sending them to the sea bed off the <a href="/wiki/Calabria" title="Calabria">Calabrian</a> coast. According to the environmental group <a href="/wiki/Legambiente" title="Legambiente">Legambiente</a>, former members of the 'Ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Accidents_involving_radioactive_waste">Accidents involving radioactive waste</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents" title="Nuclear and radiation accidents">Nuclear and radiation accidents</a></div>
<p>A few incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, shielding during transport was defective, or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store. In the Soviet Union, waste stored in <a href="/wiki/Lake_Karachay" title="Lake Karachay">Lake Karachay</a> was blown over the area during a <a href="/wiki/Dust_storm" title="Dust storm">dust storm</a> after the lake had partly dried out. At <a href="/wiki/Maxey_Flat" title="Maxey Flat">Maxey Flat</a>, a low-level radioactive waste facility located in <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, containment trenches covered with dirt, instead of steel or cement, collapsed under heavy rainfall into the trenches and filled with water. The water that invaded the trenches became radioactive and had to be disposed of at the Maxey Flat facility itself. In other cases of radioactive waste accidents, lakes or ponds with radioactive waste accidentally overflowed into the rivers during exceptional storms. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use. In France, in the summer of 2008 numerous incidents happened; in one, at the Areva plant in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tricastin_Nuclear_Power_Center" title="Tricastin Nuclear Power Center">Tricastin</a>, it was reported that during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75 kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby; in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation.</p>
<p>Scavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_contamination" title="Radioactive contamination">radiation exposure</a>, mostly in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_nation" title="Developing nation">developing nations</a>, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its <a href="/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> or scrap value. Irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the <a href="/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia_accident" title="Goiânia accident">Goiânia accident</a>.</p>
<p>Transportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel_shipping_cask" title="Spent nuclear fuel shipping cask">spent nuclear fuel shipping casks</a>.</p>
<p>On 15 December 2011 top government spokesman Osamu Fujimura of the Japanese government admitted that nuclear substances were found in the waste of Japanese nuclear facilities. Although Japan did commit itself in 1977 to these inspections in the safeguard agreement with the IAEA, the reports were kept secret for the inspectors of the <a href="/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" title="International Atomic Energy Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>. Japan did start discussions with the IAEA about the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium that were discovered in nuclear waste cleared away by Japanese nuclear operators. At the press conference Fujimura said: "Based on investigations so far, most nuclear substances have been properly managed as waste, and from that perspective, there is no problem in safety management," But according to him, the matter was at that moment still being investigated.</p>
