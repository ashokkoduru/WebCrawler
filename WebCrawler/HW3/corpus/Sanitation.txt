<p><b>Sanitation</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygienic</a> means of <a href="/wiki/Health_promotion" title="Health promotion">promoting health</a> through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hazard_prevention" title="Hazard prevention">prevention</a> of human contact with the <a href="/wiki/Hazard" title="Hazard">hazards</a> of <a href="/wiki/Waste" title="Waste">wastes</a> as well as the treatment and proper disposal of <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a>. Hazards can be either physical, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microbiological" title="Microbiological">microbiological</a>, biological or chemical agents of disease. Wastes that can cause health problems include human and animal excreta, solid wastes, domestic wastewater (sewage or <a href="/wiki/Greywater" title="Greywater">greywater</a>) industrial wastes and agricultural wastes. Hygienic means of prevention can be by using engineering solutions (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sanitary sewers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">sewage treatment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" title="Surface runoff">surface runoff</a> management, solid waste management, excreta management), simple technologies (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pit_latrines" title="Pit latrines">pit latrines</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dry_toilets" title="Dry toilets">dry toilets</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urine-diverting_dry_toilet" title="Urine-diverting dry toilet">urine-diverting dry toilets</a>, <a href="/wiki/Septic_tank" title="Septic tank">septic tank</a>s), or even simply by <a href="/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)" title="Behavior change (public health)">behavior changes</a> in personal hygiene practices, such as <a href="/wiki/Hand_washing" title="Hand washing">hand washing</a> with soap.</p>
<p>Providing sanitation to people requires a systems approach, rather than only focusing on the <a href="/wiki/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilet</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wastewater_treatment" title="Wastewater treatment">wastewater treatment</a> plant itself. The experience of the user, excreta and wastewater collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and <a href="/wiki/Reuse_of_excreta" title="Reuse of excreta">reuse</a> or disposal all need to be thoroughly considered.</p>
<p>The main objective of a sanitation system is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment and breaking the cycle of disease.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_and_purposes">Definition and purposes</span></h2>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> defines the term "sanitation" as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"Sanitation generally refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human urine and feces. The word 'sanitation' also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions, through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sanitation includes all four of these engineering infrastructure items (even though often only the first one is strongly associated with the term "sanitation"): Excreta management systems, wastewater management systems (included here are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wastewater_treatment_plants" title="Wastewater treatment plants">wastewater treatment plants</a>), solid waste management systems, drainage systems for rainwater, also called stormwater drainage.</p>
<p>There are some slight variations on the definition of sanitation in use. For example, for many organisations, <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygiene</a> promotion is seen as an integral part of sanitation. For this reason, the <a href="/wiki/Water_Supply_and_Sanitation_Collaborative_Council" title="Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council">Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council</a> defines sanitation as "The collection, transport, treatment and disposal or <a href="/wiki/Reuse_of_excreta" title="Reuse of excreta">reuse of human excreta</a>, domestic wastewater and solid waste, and associated hygiene promotion."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that sanitation includes wastewater treatment, the two terms are often use side by side as "sanitation and wastewater management". The term sanitation has been connected to several descriptors so that the terms sustainable sanitation, improved sanitation, unimproved sanitation, environmental sanitation, on-site sanitation, ecological sanitation, dry sanitation are all in use today. Sanitation should be regarded with a systems approach in mind which includes collection/containment, conveyance/transport, treatment, disposal or reuse.</p>
<p>The overall purposes of sanitation are to provide a healthy living environment for everyone, to protect the natural resources (such as <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a>), and to provide safety, security and <a href="/wiki/Dignity" title="Dignity">dignity</a> for people when they <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defecate" title="Defecate">defecate</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urinate" title="Urinate">urinate</a>.</p>
<p>Effective sanitation systems provide barriers between excreta and humans in such a way as to break the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disease_transmission" title="Disease transmission">disease transmission</a> cycle (for example in the case of fecal-borne diseases). This aspect is visualised with the F-diagram where all major routes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fecal-oral_route" title="Fecal-oral route">fecal-oral disease transmission</a> begin with the letter F: feces, fingers, flies, fields, fluids, food.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h2>
<p>The term sanitation is connected with various descriptors or adjectives to signify certain types of sanitation systems (which may deal only with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human_excreta" title="Human excreta">human excreta</a> management or with the entire sanitation system, i.e. also greywater, stormwater and solid waste management) - in alphabetical order:</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Community-led_total_sanitation" title="Community-led total sanitation">Community-led total sanitation</a></div>
<p>Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is an approach to achieve <a href="/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)" title="Behavior change (public health)">behavior change</a> in mainly rural people by a process of "triggering", leading to spontaneous and long-term abandonment of <a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">open defecation</a> practices. CLTS takes an approach to rural sanitation that works without hardware subsidies and that facilitates communities to recognize the problem of open defecation and take <a href="/wiki/Collective_action" title="Collective action">collective action</a> to clean up and become "open defecation free".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dry_sanitation">Dry sanitation</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Dry_toilet" title="Dry toilet">Dry toilet</a></div>
<p>The term "dry sanitation" is somewhat misleading as sanitation includes hand-washing and can never be "dry". A more precise term would be "dry excreta management". When people speak of "dry sanitation" they usually mean sanitation systems with <a href="/wiki/Dry_toilet" title="Dry toilet">dry toilets</a> with <a href="/wiki/Urine_diversion" title="Urine diversion">urine diversion</a>, in particular the <a href="/wiki/Urine-diverting_dry_toilet" title="Urine-diverting dry toilet">urine-diverting dry toilet</a> (UDDT).</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ecological_sanitation" title="Ecological sanitation">Ecological sanitation</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ecological_sanitation" title="Ecological sanitation">Ecological sanitation</a>, which is commonly abbreviated to ecosan, is an approach, rather than a technology or a device which is characterized by a desire to "close the loop" (mainly for the nutrients and organic matter) between sanitation and agriculture in a safe manner. Put in other words: "Ecosan systems safely recycle excreta resources (plant nutrients and organic matter) to crop production in such a way that the use of non-renewable resources is minimised". When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe, economical, and closed-loop system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land. Ecosan is also called resource-oriented sanitation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_sanitation">Environmental sanitation</span></h3>
<p>Environmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disease_transmission" title="Disease transmission">disease transmission</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lack_of_sanitation">Lack of sanitation</span></h3>
<p>Lack of sanitation refers to the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually <a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">open defecation</a> (and open urination but this is of less concern) with the associated serious public health issues.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Onsite_sewage_facility" title="Onsite sewage facility">Onsite sewage facility</a></div>
<p>On-site sanitation, also called decentralised sanitation, is a system where the treatment of excreta or <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> takes place at the same location where it is generated. Examples are pit <a href="/wiki/Latrine" title="Latrine">latrines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Septic_tank" title="Septic tank">septic tanks</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Imhoff_tank" title="Imhoff tank">Imhoff tanks</a>.

The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_Sanitation_Alliance" title="Sustainable Sanitation Alliance">Sustainable Sanitation Alliance</a> had defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be not only (i) economically viable, (ii) socially acceptable, and (iii) technically and (iv) institutionally appropriate, it should also (v) protect the environment and the natural resources.</p>

<p>For any social and economic development, adequate sanitation in conjunction with good hygiene and safe water are essential to good health. Lack of proper sanitation causes diseases. Most of the diseases resulting from sanitation have a direct relation to poverty. The lack of clean water and poor sanitation causes many diseases and the spread of diseases. It is estimated that inadequate sanitation is responsible for 4.0 percent of deaths and 5.7 percent of disease burden worldwide.</p>
<p>Lack of sanitation is a serious issue that is affecting most developing countries and countries in transition. The importance of the isolation of excreta and waste lies in an effort to prevent diseases which can be <a href="/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)" title="Transmission (medicine)">transmitted</a> through human waste, which afflict both <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developed_countries" title="Developed countries">developed countries</a> as well as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> to differing degrees.</p>
<p>It is estimated that up to 5 million people die each year from preventable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water-borne_diseases" title="Water-borne diseases">waterborne diseases</a>, as a result of inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices. The effects of sanitation has impacted the society of people throughout history. Sanitation is a necessity for a healthy life.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diarrhea">Diarrhea</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">Diarrhea</a></div>
<p>Diarrhea plays a significant role: Deaths resulting from diarrhea are estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.5 million deaths every year. Most of the affected are young children below the ages of five. Children suffering from diarrhea are more vulnerable to become underweight (due to <a href="/wiki/Stunted_growth" title="Stunted growth">stunted growth</a>) which makes them more vulnerable to other diseases such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Acute_respiratory_infection" title="Acute respiratory infection">acute respiratory infections</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that improvements in drinking water and sanitation (<a href="/wiki/WASH" title="WASH">WASH</a>) lead to decreased risks of diarrhoea. Such improvements might include for example use of water filters, provision of high-quality <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">piped water</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sewer</a> connections.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">Open defecation</a> - or lack of sanitation - is a major factor in causing various diseases, most notably <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infectious_diarrhea" title="Infectious diarrhea">diarrhea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helminthiasis" title="Helminthiasis">intestinal worm infections</a>. For example, infectious diarrhea resulted in about 0.7 million deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. It can also lead to <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stunted_growth" title="Stunted growth">stunted growth</a> in children. Open defecation is a leading cause of diarrheal death; 2,000 children under the age of five die every day, one every 40 seconds, from <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Malnutrition_and_stunting">Malnutrition and stunting</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition_in_children" title="Malnutrition in children">Malnutrition in children</a></div>
<p>The combination of direct and indirect deaths from <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a> caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated by the World Health Organisation to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age. The multiple interdependencies between malnutrition and infectious diseases make it very difficult to quantify the portion of malnutrition that is caused by infectious diseases which are in turn caused by unsafe WASH practices. Based on expert opinions and a literature survey, researchers at WHO arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections as a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="List_of_diseases_caused_by_lack_of_sanitation">List of diseases caused by lack of sanitation</span></h3>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">Wastewater</a></div>

<p>Wastewater management consists of collection, <a href="/wiki/Wastewater_treatment" title="Wastewater treatment">wastewater treatment</a> (be it municipal or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_wastewater" title="Industrial wastewater">industrial wastewater</a>), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as <a href="/wiki/Reclaimed_water" title="Reclaimed water">water reclamation</a>.</p>
<p>The standard sanitation technology in urban areas is the collection of <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">wastewater treatment plants</a> for <a href="/wiki/Reuse" title="Reuse">reuse</a> or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with <a href="/wiki/Storm_drain" title="Storm drain">storm drains</a> or separated from them as <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sanitary sewers</a>. <a href="/wiki/Combined_sewer" title="Combined sewer">Combined sewers</a> are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy <a href="/wiki/Stormwater" title="Stormwater">rainfall</a> and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer_overflow" title="Sanitary sewer overflow">sanitary sewer overflows</a>, i.e., more or less diluted raw <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.</p>
<p>The high investment cost of conventional wastewater collection systems are difficult to afford for many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a>. Some countries therefore promote alternative wastewater collection systems such as condominial sewerage, which uses pipes with smaller diameters at lower trench depth with different network layouts from conventional sewerage.</p>
<p>In developed countries centralised treatment of municipal wastewater is now quite widespread. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. For example, in Latin America only about 15% of collected sewage is being treated (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_and_sanitation_in_Latin_America" title="Water and sanitation in Latin America">water and sanitation in Latin America</a>).</p>
<p>In many suburban and rural areas households are not connected to sewers, and they rather use <a href="/wiki/Onsite_sewage_facility" title="Onsite sewage facility">on-site sewage facilities</a> or decentralised treatment if they are connected to piped water and use flush toilets. They discharge their wastewater into <a href="/wiki/Septic_tank" title="Septic tank">septic tanks</a> or other types of on-site sanitation systems (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Sequencing_batch_reactor" title="Sequencing batch reactor">Sequencing batch reactors</a> or <a href="/wiki/Constructed_wetland" title="Constructed wetland">constructed wetlands</a>). On-site systems include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drain_field" title="Drain field">drain fields</a>, which require significant area of land. This makes septic systems unsuitable for most cities.</p>
<p>The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater in <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigated agriculture</a> is common in developing countries. The reuse of treated wastewater in landscaping, especially on golf courses, irrigated agriculture and for industrial use is becoming increasingly widespread.</p>

<p>Disposal of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solid_waste" title="Solid waste">solid waste</a> is most commonly conducted in <a href="/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a>, but incineration, <a href="/wiki/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Compost" title="Compost">composting</a> and conversion to <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a> are also avenues.

The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogens</a>. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of <a href="/wiki/Leachate" title="Leachate">leachate</a> that could contaminate <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> (and hence jeopardize some <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a> supplies).</p>
<p>For incineration options, the release of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pollutant" title="Air pollutant">air pollutants</a>, including certain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a> components is an attendant adverse outcome.

In general, to improve cleanability, this equipment is made from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stainless_Steel" title="Stainless Steel">Stainless Steel</a> 316L, (an <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloy</a> containing small amounts of <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>). The surface is usually <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electropolish" title="Electropolish">electropolished</a> to an effective surface roughness of less than 0.5 <a href="/wiki/Micrometre" title="Micrometre">micrometre</a> to reduce the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacterial</a> adhesion.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, during the Millennium Summit in New York in 2000 and the 2002 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Summit_on_Sustainable_Development" title="World Summit on Sustainable Development">World Summit on Sustainable Development</a> in Johannesburg, developed the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs) aimed at poverty eradication and sustainable development. The specific goal for the year 2015 is to reduce by half the number of people who had no access to <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">potable water</a> and sanitation in the baseline year of 1990. In the year 2016, the <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals" title="Sustainable Development Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> replaced the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>In 2004, the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Monitoring_Programme_for_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation" title="Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation">Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation</a> (JMP) of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" title="World Health Organisation">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO) and of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Children%27s_Fund" title="United Nations Children's Fund">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) reported that the number of people lacking basic sanitation services rose from 2.1 billion in 2001 to 2.6 billion by 2004. As the JMP and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme" title="United Nations Development Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> (UNDP) Human Development Report in 2006 has shown, progress meeting the MDG sanitation target is too slow, with a large gap between the target coverage and the current reality.</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons for this gap. A major one is that sanitation is rarely given political attention received by other topics despite its key importance. Sanitation is not high on the international development agenda, and projects such as those relating to <a href="/wiki/Water_supply" title="Water supply">water supply</a> projects are emphasised.</p>
<p>In December 2006, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="United Nations General Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> declared 2008 "The <a href="/wiki/International_Year_of_Sanitation" title="International Year of Sanitation">International Year of Sanitation</a>", in recognition of the slow progress being made towards the MDGs sanitation target. The year aimed to develop awareness and action to meet the target. Particular concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the stigma around sanitation, so that the importance of sanitation can be more easily and publicly discussed.</li>
<li>Highlighting the <a href="/wiki/Poverty_reduction" title="Poverty reduction">poverty reduction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Health" title="Health">health</a> and other benefits that flow from better hygiene, household sanitation arrangements and wastewater treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Joint_Monitoring_Programme_for_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation" title="Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation">Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WHO" title="WHO">WHO</a> and <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> has defined <a href="/wiki/Improved_sanitation" title="Improved sanitation">improved sanitation</a> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Flush_toilet" title="Flush toilet">Flush toilet</a> or flush / pour-flush to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pit_toilet" title="Pit toilet">pit latrine</a> with are connected to either a <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sewer</a> system or a <a href="/wiki/Septic_tank" title="Septic tank">septic system</a></li>
<li>Ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP)</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Composting_toilet" title="Composting toilet">Composting toilet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The JMP publishes a report of updated estimates every two years on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels. For example, in March 2012, the JMP released an update. According to the definition above, 1.8 billion more people used improved sanitation in 2010 than in 1990, bringing the percentage of people using improved sanitation to 63% globally. However, the world did not achieve the sanitation target of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goal" title="Millennium Development Goal">Millennium Development Goals</a> in 2015. 2.5 billion lack improved sanitation. According to the JMP, if current trends continue, in 2015 2.4 billion people will lack access to improved sanitation facilities. 15 per cent of the population still practise <a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">open defecation</a>, defined as defecation in fields, forests, bushes, bodies of water or other open spaces. This represents 1.1 billion people. Though the proportion of people practising <a href="/wiki/Open_defecation" title="Open defecation">open defecation</a> is decreasing, the absolute number has remained at over one billion for several years, due to population growth.</p>
<p>This outcome presents substantial public health risks as the waste could contaminate <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a> and cause life-threatening forms of <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a> to infants. Most cities can neither afford a sewage collection system, nor a sewage treatment system. Improved sanitation, including <a href="/wiki/Hand_washing" title="Hand washing">hand washing</a> and water purification, could save the lives of 1.5 million children who die from diarrheal diseases each year.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Various_initiatives">Various initiatives</span></h3>
<p>In 2011 the <a href="/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> launched the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human waste. The program is aimed at developing technologies that might help bridge the global sanitation gap.</p>
<p>Research from the <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> suggests that sanitation and hygiene promotion needs to be better "mainstreamed" in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Development_cooperation" title="Development cooperation">development cooperation</a>, if the MDG on sanitation is to be met. At present, promotion of sanitation and hygiene is mainly carried out through water institutions. The research argues that many institutions that should carry out activities to develop better sanitation and hygiene in developing countries. For example, educational institutions can teach on <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygiene</a>, and health institutions can dedicate resources to preventative works (to avoid, for example, outbreaks of <a href="/wiki/Cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a>). There are also civil society organisations providing some of the necessary infrastructure where national governments cannot do that on their own.</p>

<p>The earliest evidence of urban sanitation was seen in <a href="/wiki/Harappa" title="Harappa">Harappa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mohenjo-daro" title="Mohenjo-daro">Mohenjo-daro</a>, and the recently discovered <a href="/wiki/Rakhigarhi" title="Rakhigarhi">Rakhigarhi</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indus_Valley_civilization" title="Indus Valley civilization">Indus Valley civilization</a>. This urban plan included the world's first urban sanitation systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from <a href="/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">wells</a>. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> cities and <a href="/wiki/Roman_villa" title="Roman villa">Roman villas</a> had elements of sanitation systems, delivering water in the streets of towns such as <a href="/wiki/Pompeii" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, and building stone and wooden drains to collect and remove <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> from populated areas—see for instance the <a href="/wiki/Cloaca_Maxima" title="Cloaca Maxima">Cloaca Maxima</a> into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/River_Tiber" title="River Tiber">River Tiber</a> in Rome. But there is little record of other sanitation in most of Europe until the <a href="/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a>. Unsanitary conditions and overcrowding were widespread throughout <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, resulting periodically in cataclysmic <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" title="Pandemic">pandemics</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian" title="Plague of Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> (541-42) and the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> (1347–1351), which killed tens of millions of people and radically altered societies.</p>
<p>Very high infant and child mortality prevailed in Europe throughout <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medieval" title="Medieval">medieval</a> times, due not only to deficiencies in sanitation but to an insufficient food supply for a population which had expanded faster than <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. This was further complicated by frequent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Warfare" title="Warfare">warfare</a> and exploitation of civilians by autocratic rulers.</p>
