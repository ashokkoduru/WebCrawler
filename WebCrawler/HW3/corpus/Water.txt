<p><b>Water</b> is a transparent and nearly colorless <a href="/wiki/Chemical_substance" title="Chemical substance">chemical substance</a> that is the main constituent of Earth's <a href="/wiki/Stream" title="Stream">streams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lake" title="Lake">lakes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Fluid" title="Fluid">fluids</a> of most living <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a>. Its <a href="/wiki/Chemical_formula" title="Chemical formula">chemical formula</a> is <b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b>, meaning that its <a href="/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecule</a> contains one <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and two <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <a href="/wiki/Atom" title="Atom">atoms</a>, that are connected by <a href="/wiki/Covalent_bond" title="Covalent bond">covalent bonds</a>.

<p>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. It is vital for all known forms of <a href="/wiki/Life#Range_of_tolerance" title="Life">life</a>. On Earth, 96.5% of the planet's crust water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">air</a> as <a href="/wiki/Vapor" title="Vapor">vapor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cloud" title="Cloud">clouds</a> (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a>. Only 2.5% of this water is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater">freshwater</a>, and 98.8% of that water is in ice (excepting ice in clouds) and <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a>. Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. A greater quantity of water is found in the earth's interior.</p>
<p>Water on Earth moves continually through the <a href="/wiki/Water_cycle" title="Water cycle">water cycle</a> of <a href="/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transpiration" title="Transpiration">transpiration</a> (<a href="/wiki/Evapotranspiration" title="Evapotranspiration">evapotranspiration</a>), <a href="/wiki/Condensation" title="Condensation">condensation</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Surface_runoff" title="Surface runoff">runoff</a>, usually reaching the sea.

Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or <a href="/wiki/Adsorption" title="Adsorption">adsorbed</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mineral_hydration" title="Mineral hydration">hydrated minerals</a>.</p>
<p>Safe <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a> is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no <a href="/wiki/Food_energy" title="Food energy">calories</a> or <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic</a> <a href="/wiki/Nutrient" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a>. Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a>. There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product_per_capita" title="Gross domestic product per capita">gross domestic product per capita</a>. However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world population</a> will be facing water-based vulnerability. A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.</p>
<p>Water plays an important role in the <a href="/wiki/World_economy" title="World economy">world economy</a>. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fishing" title="Fishing">Fishing</a> in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world.

Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for <a href="/wiki/Cooling" title="Cooling">cooling</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heating" title="Heating">heating</a>, in industry and homes.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="States">States</span></h3>

<p>Water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life. Specifically, at normal atmospheric pressure of 1 <a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" title="Bar (unit)">bar</a> (0.98692 <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)" title="Atmosphere (unit)">atm</a>, 100 k<a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" title="Pascal (unit)">Pa</a>, 14.5 <a href="/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" title="Pounds per square inch">psi</a>), water is a liquid between the temperatures of 273.15 <a href="/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a> (0 <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">°C</a>, 32 <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" title="Fahrenheit">°F</a>) and 373.15 K (100 °C, 212 °F). Increasing the pressure slightly lowers the <a href="/wiki/Melting_point" title="Melting point">melting point</a>, which is about −5 °C at 600 atm, −22 °C at 2100 atm. This effect is relevant, for example, to <a href="/wiki/Ice_skating" title="Ice skating">ice skating</a>, to the <a href="/wiki/Lake_Vostok" title="Lake Vostok">buried lakes of Antartica</a>, and to the movement of <a href="/wiki/Glacier" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>. (At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.)</p>
<p>Increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the <a href="/wiki/Boiling_point" title="Boiling point">boiling point</a>, that is about 374 °C at 220 atm. This effect is important in, among other things, deep-sea <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrothermal_vents" title="Hydrothermal vents">hydrothermal vents</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geyser" title="Geyser">geysers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pressure_cooking" title="Pressure cooking">pressure cooking</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a> design. At the top of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Everest" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a>, where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm, water boils at 68 °C (154 °F).</p>
<p>At very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state, and passes directly from solid to gas by <a href="/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)" title="Sublimation (phase transition)">sublimation</a>—a phenomenon exploited in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Freeze_drying" title="Freeze drying">freeze drying</a> of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called <a href="/wiki/Supercritical_fluid" title="Supercritical fluid">supercritical steam</a>.</p>
<p>Water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less <a href="/wiki/Density" title="Density">dense</a> as it freezes. The maximum density of water is 1,000 kg/m (62.43 lb/cu ft), that occurs at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F), whereas the density of ice is 917 kg/m (57.25 lb/cu ft). Thus, water expands 9% in volume as it freezes, which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taste_and_odor">Taste and odor</span></h3>
<p>Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths. and frogs are known to be able to smell it  However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Humans" title="Humans">Humans</a>, and other animals, have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">potability</a> of water by avoiding water that is too salty or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Putrid" title="Putrid">putrid</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Color_and_appearance">Color and appearance</span></h3>
<p>The apparent color of natural bodies of water (and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids, or by reflection of the sky, than by water itself.</p>
<p>Light in the visible <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> can traverse a couple <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meter" title="Meter">meters</a> of pure water (or ice) without significant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optical_absorption" title="Optical absorption">absorption</a>, so that it looks <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transparency_(optics)" title="Transparency (optics)">transparent</a> and colorless. Thus <a href="/wiki/Aquatic_plant" title="Aquatic plant">aquatic plants</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alga" title="Alga">algae</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> can reach them. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.</p>
<p>Through a thickness of 10 meters or more, however, the intrinsic <a href="/wiki/Color_of_water" title="Color of water">color of water</a> (or ice) is visibly <a href="/wiki/Turquoise_(color)" title="Turquoise (color)">turquoise</a> (grenish blue), as its <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water" title="Electromagnetic absorption by water">absorption spectrum</a> has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light (1/227 m at 418 nm). The color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness. (Practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below 1000 meters of depth.) Infrared and ultraviolet light, on the other hand, is strongly <a href="/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)" title="Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)">absorbed</a> by water.</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Refraction_index" title="Refraction index">refraction index</a> of liquid water (1.333 at 20 °C) is much higher than that of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air" title="Air">air</a> (1.0), similar to those of <a href="/wiki/Alkane" title="Alkane">alkanes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>, but lower than those of <a href="/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a> (1.473), <a href="/wiki/Benzene" title="Benzene">benzene</a> (1.501), <a href="/wiki/Carbon_disulfide" title="Carbon disulfide">carbon disulfide</a> (1.627), and common types of <a href="/wiki/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a> (1.4 to 1.6). The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Polarity_and_hydrogen_bonding">Polarity and hydrogen bonding</span></h3>



<p>Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher <a href="/wiki/Electronegativity" title="Electronegativity">electronegativity</a> than hydrogen atoms, it is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polar_molecule" title="Polar molecule">polar molecule</a>, with an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_dipole_moment" title="Electrical dipole moment">electrical dipole moment</a>: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. Water is a good polar <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a>, that dissoves many <a href="/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)" title="Salt (chemistry)">salts</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrophilic" title="Hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a> organic molecules such as <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugars</a> and simple <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohols</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>. Most <a href="/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acids</a> dissolve in water to yield the corresponding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anion" title="Anion">anions</a>. Many substances in living organisms, such as <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>, <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polysaccharide" title="Polysaccharide">polysaccharides</a>, are dissolved in water. Water also dissolves many <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a>, such as oxygen and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> — the latter giving the fizz of <a href="/wiki/Carbonation" title="Carbonation">carbonated</a> beverages, <a href="/wiki/Sparkling_wine" title="Sparkling wine">sparkling wines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beer" title="Beer">beers</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many organic substances (such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lipids" title="Lipids">fats and oils</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alkanes" title="Alkanes">alkanes</a>) are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrophobic" title="Hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a>, that is, insoluble in water. Many inorganic subtances are insoluble too, including most metal <a href="/wiki/Oxide" title="Oxide">oxides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfide" title="Sulfide">sulfides</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Silicate" title="Silicate">silicates</a>.</p>
<p>Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bonds" title="Hydrogen bonds">hydrogen bonds</a> with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water's high <a href="/wiki/Surface_tension" title="Surface tension">surface tension</a> and capillary forces. The <a href="/wiki/Capillary_action" title="Capillary action">capillary action</a> refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>. This property is relied upon by all <a href="/wiki/Vascular_plant" title="Vascular plant">vascular plants</a>, such as trees.</p>
<p>The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> (<span class="chemf nowrap">H<span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left"><br/>
2</span>S</span>). They also explain its exceptionally high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity" title="Specific heat capacity">specific heat capacity</a> (about 4.2 <a href="/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">J</a>/<a href="/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">g</a>/K), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_of_fusion" title="Heat of fusion">heat of fusion</a> (about 333 J/g), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_of_vaporization" title="Heat of vaporization">heat of vaporization</a> (<span class="nowrap">2257 J/g</span>), and <a href="/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" title="Thermal conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> (between 0.561 and 0.679 <a href="/wiki/Watt" title="Watt">W</a>/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a>, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electrical_conductivity_and_electrolysis">Electrical conductivity and electrolysis</span></h3>
<p>Pure water has a low <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_conductivity" title="Electrical conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>, which increases with the <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_(chemistry)" title="Dissolution (chemistry)">dissolution</a> of a small amount of ionic material such as <a href="/wiki/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">common salt</a>.</p>
<p>Liquid water can be split into the <a href="/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">elements</a> hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it — a process called <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water" title="Electrolysis of water">electrolysis</a>. The decomposition requires more <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> input than the <a href="/wiki/Standard_enthalpy_of_formation" title="Standard enthalpy of formation">heat released by the inverse process</a> (285.8 kJ/<a href="/wiki/Mole_(unit)" title="Mole (unit)">mol</a>, or 15.9 MJ/kg).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanical_properties">Mechanical properties</span></h3>
<p>Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes: its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">6990510000000000000♠</span>5.1<span style="margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em;">×</span>10 Pa</span> in ordinary conditions. Even in <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a> at 4 km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a> of water is about 10 Pa·<a href="/wiki/Second" title="Second">s</a> or 0.01 <a href="/wiki/Poise" title="Poise">poise</a> at 20 °C, and the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_sound" title="Speed of sound">speed of sound</a> in liquid water ranges between 1400 and 1540 m/s depending on temperature. Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 <a href="/wiki/Decibel" title="Decibel">dB</a>/km for 1 k<a href="/wiki/Hertz" title="Hertz">Hz</a>), a property that is exploited by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cetaceans" title="Cetaceans">cetaceans</a> and humans for communication and environment sensing (<a href="/wiki/Sonar" title="Sonar">sonar</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactivity">Reactivity</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_the_universe">In the universe</span></h3>

<p>Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of <a href="/wiki/Star_formation" title="Star formation">star formation</a>. The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.</p>
<p>On 22 July 2011 a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing "140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined" around a <a href="/wiki/Quasar" title="Quasar">quasar</a> located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the "discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence".</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_cycle">Water cycle</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Water_cycle" title="Water cycle">Water cycle</a></div>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Water_cycle" title="Water cycle">water cycle</a> (known scientifically as the <b>hydrologic cycle</b>) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the <a href="/wiki/Hydrosphere" title="Hydrosphere">hydrosphere</a>, between the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth_atmosphere" title="Earth atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> water, <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>.</p>
<p>Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the <i>water cycle</i> consisting of following transfer processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a> from oceans and other water bodies into the air and <a href="/wiki/Transpiration" title="Transpiration">transpiration</a> from land plants and animals into air.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a>, from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Runoff_(water)" title="Runoff (water)">runoff</a> from the land usually reaching the <a href="/wiki/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metric_tonne_unit" title="Metric tonne unit">Tt</a> per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72 Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly <a href="/wiki/Rain" title="Rain">rain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Snow" title="Snow">snow</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hail" title="Hail">hail</a>, with some contribution from <a href="/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dew" title="Dew">dew</a>. Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase. Condensed water in the air may also <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Refract" title="Refract">refract</a> <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> to produce <a href="/wiki/Rainbow" title="Rainbow">rainbows</a>.</p>
<p>Water runoff often collects over <a href="/wiki/Drainage_basin" title="Drainage basin">watersheds</a> flowing into rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a <a href="/wiki/Hydrological_transport_model" title="Hydrological transport model">hydrological transport model</a>. Some water is diverted to <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for <a href="/wiki/Travel" title="Travel">travel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commerce" title="Commerce">commerce</a>. Through <a href="/wiki/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a>, runoff shapes the environment creating river <a href="/wiki/Valley" title="Valley">valleys</a> and <a href="/wiki/River_delta" title="River delta">deltas</a> which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A <a href="/wiki/Flood" title="Flood">flood</a> occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A <a href="/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">drought</a> is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Water_resources" title="Water resources">Water resources</a></div>
<p>Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes. At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow pack and glaciers. Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)" title="Spring (hydrosphere)">springs</a>, or more spectacularly in <a href="/wiki/Hot_spring" title="Hot spring">hot springs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geyser" title="Geyser">geysers</a>. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in <a href="/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">wells</a>. This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">Seawater</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tides" title="Tides">Tides</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">Sea water</a> contains about 3.5% <a href="/wiki/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">salt</a> on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9 °C) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> to 4.0% in the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">Tides</a> are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" title="Tidal force">tidal forces</a> of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuarine</a> water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">effects of Earth rotation</a> and the local <a href="/wiki/Bathymetry" title="Bathymetry">bathymetry</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_on_life">Effects on life</span></h2>


<p>From a <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biological</a> standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of <a href="/wiki/Life" title="Life">life</a>. It carries out this role by allowing <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic compounds</a> to react in ways that ultimately allow <a href="/wiki/Self-replication" title="Self-replication">replication</a>. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many <a href="/wiki/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolic</a> processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.</p>
<p>Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).</p>
<p>Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a <a href="/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Acids" title="Acids">Acids</a> have pH values less than 7 while <a href="/wiki/Base_(chemistry)" title="Base (chemistry)">bases</a> have values greater than 7.</p>

<p>Earth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as <a href="/wiki/Dolphin" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Whale" title="Whale">whales</a>. Some kinds of animals, such as <a href="/wiki/Amphibian" title="Amphibian">amphibians</a>, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as <a href="/wiki/Kelp" title="Kelp">kelp</a> and <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a> grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. <a href="/wiki/Plankton" title="Plankton">Plankton</a> is generally the foundation of the ocean <a href="/wiki/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chain</a>.</p>

Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Siphon_(insect)" title="Siphon (insect)">insect</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siphon_(mollusc)" title="Siphon (mollusc)">mollusc siphons</a>) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gills" title="Gills">gills</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Carcinus" title="Carcinus">Carcinus</a></i>).

In places such as <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_and_pollution">Health and pollution</span></h3>

<p>Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potable_water" title="Potable water">potable water</a>. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or <a href="/wiki/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a>, or by a range of <a href="/wiki/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">other methods</a>.</p>
<p>Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Safe_water" title="Safe water">safe water</a>, or "safe for bathing". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> or by the use of <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light.</p>
<p>In the USA, non-potable forms of <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> generated by humans may be referred to as <a href="/wiki/Greywater" title="Greywater">greywater</a>, which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and <a href="/wiki/Blackwater_(waste)" title="Blackwater (waste)">blackwater</a>, which generally contains <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> and other forms of waste which require <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">further treatment</a> in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment (<a href="/wiki/Sink" title="Sink">sinks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shower" title="Shower">showers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kitchen" title="Kitchen">kitchen</a> runoff, but not <a href="/wiki/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilets</a>, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.</p>
<p>This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> during the <a href="/wiki/29th_G8_summit" title="29th G8 summit">2003 G8 Evian summit</a>. Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">water quality</a> and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water. The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> estimates that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Safe_water" title="Safe water">safe water</a> could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a> each year.</p>
<p>Water, however, is not a finite resource, but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many degrees of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking <a href="/wiki/Water_supply" title="Water supply">water supply</a>, which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a <a href="/wiki/Non-renewable_resource" title="Non-renewable resource">non-renewable resource</a>, and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.</p>
<p>In the developing world, 90% of all <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> still goes untreated into local rivers and streams. Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles. The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.</p>

<p>The most important use of water in <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> is for <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>, which is a key component to produce enough food. Irrigation takes up to 90% of water withdrawn in some developing countries and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (in the United States, 30% of freshwater usage is for irrigation).</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At this time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of <a href="/wiki/Peak_water" title="Peak water">peak water</a>. This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Urbanisation" title="Urbanisation">urbanisation</a> and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.</p>
<p>An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the <a href="/wiki/International_Water_Management_Institute" title="International Water Management Institute">International Water Management Institute</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population. It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of <a href="/wiki/Physical_water_scarcity" title="Physical water scarcity">physical water scarcity</a>, where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing <a href="/wiki/Economic_water_scarcity" title="Economic water scarcity">economic water scarcity</a>, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_scientific_standard">As a scientific standard</span></h4>
<p>On 7 April 1795, the <a href="/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">gram</a> was defined in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> to be equal to "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice." For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a>. Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one <a href="/wiki/Litre" title="Litre">liter</a> of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0 °C — a highly reproducible <i>temperature</i> — the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water <i>density</i>, which was measured at the time as 4 °C (39 °F).</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kelvin_temperature_scale" title="Kelvin temperature scale">Kelvin temperature scale</a> of the SI system is based on the <a href="/wiki/Triple_point" title="Triple point">triple point</a> of water, defined as exactly 273.16 K or 0.01 °C. The scale is an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_temperature" title="Absolute temperature">absolute temperature</a> scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the <a href="/wiki/Boiling_point" title="Boiling point">boiling point</a> (set to 100 °C) and <a href="/wiki/Melting_point" title="Melting point">melting point</a> (set to 0 °C) of water.</p>
<p>Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 (<a href="/wiki/Deuterium" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a>). The amount of deuterium oxides or <a href="/wiki/Heavy_water" title="Heavy water">heavy water</a> is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the <a href="/wiki/Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water" title="Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water">Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water</a> specification.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="For_drinking">For drinking</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">Drinking water</a></div>


<p>The <a href="/wiki/Human_body" title="Human body">human body</a> contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water per <a href="/wiki/Day" title="Day">day</a> to avoid <a href="/wiki/Dehydration" title="Dehydration">dehydration</a>; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.</p>
<p>For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of <a href="/wiki/Water_intoxication" title="Water intoxication">water intoxication</a> (hyperhydration), which can be fatal. The popular claim that "a person should consume eight glasses of water per day" seems to have no real basis in science. Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500 ml at mealtime was conducive to weight loss. Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.</p>

<p>An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council" title="United States National Research Council">United States National Research Council</a> read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods." The latest dietary reference intake report by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council" title="United States National Research Council">United States National Research Council</a> in general recommended (including food sources): 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters of water total for women.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="/wiki/Pregnancy" title="Pregnancy">pregnant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Breastfeeding" title="Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine" title="Institute of Medicine">Institute of Medicine</a> (U.S.) recommends that, on average, men consume 3.0 liters and women 2.2 liters; pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (10 cups) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing. Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages (<a href="/wiki/Caffeine" title="Caffeine">caffeinated</a> included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">feces</a>, through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sweat" title="Sweat">sweating</a>, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.</p>
<p>Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead, and/or harmful <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Vibrio" title="Vibrio">Vibrio</a></i>.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_uses">Chemical uses</span></h4>
<p>Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a <a href="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactant" title="Reactant">reactant</a> and less commonly as a <a href="/wiki/Solution" title="Solution">solute</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a>. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amphoteric" title="Amphoteric">amphoteric</a> (acidic <i>and</i> basic) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nucleophilic" title="Nucleophilic">nucleophilic</a>. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diels-Alder_reaction" title="Diels-Alder reaction">Diels-Alder reactions</a> by water has been observed. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supercritical_water" title="Supercritical water">Supercritical water</a> has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_exchange">Heat exchange</span></h4>
<p>Water and steam are a common fluid used for <a href="/wiki/Heat_exchanger" title="Heat exchanger">heat exchange</a>, due to its availability and high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_capacity_of_water" title="Heat capacity of water">heat capacity</a>, both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through <a href="/wiki/Vaporization" title="Vaporization">vaporization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Condensation" title="Condensation">condensation</a> of water because of its large <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latent_heat_of_vaporization" title="Latent heat of vaporization">latent heat of vaporization</a>. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as <a href="/wiki/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a> are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidized</a> faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all <a href="/wiki/Thermal_power_station" title="Thermal power station">thermal power stations</a>, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by <a href="/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Cooling_tower" title="Cooling tower">cooling tower</a>). In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> industry, water can also be used as a <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">neutron moderator</a>. In most <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactors</a>, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also <a href="/wiki/Void_coefficient" title="Void coefficient">slows the nuclear reaction down</a>. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fire_extinction">Fire extinction</span></h4>

<p>Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fire_fighting#Use_of_water" title="Fire fighting">fire extinguishing</a> fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.</p>
<p>Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a <a href="/wiki/Steam_explosion" title="Steam explosion">steam explosion</a>, which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Coke_(fuel)" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a> graphite, decompose the water, producing <a href="/wiki/Water_gas" title="Water gas">water gas</a>.</p>
<p>The power of such explosions was seen in the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>, although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system.

<p><a href="/wiki/Boiling" title="Boiling">Boiling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steaming" title="Steaming">steaming</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Simmering" title="Simmering">simmering</a> are popular <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a> methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam. Water is also used for <a href="/wiki/Dishwashing" title="Dishwashing">dishwashing</a>. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of <a href="/wiki/Food_science" title="Food science">food science</a>. It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Solution" title="Solution">Solutes</a> such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Air_pressure" title="Air pressure">air pressure</a>, which is in turn is affected by <a href="/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a>. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One <a href="/wiki/Mole_(unit)" title="Mole (unit)">mole</a> of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 °C (0.918 °F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 °C (1.836 °F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.</p>
<p>Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food. Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water. Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity. Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.</p>
<p>Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains. Water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100 mg/l (UK) or less than 60 mg/l (USA).</p>
<p>According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.</p>

Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the <a href="/wiki/International_Water_Management_Institute" title="International Water Management Institute">International Water Management Institute</a> of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/UN_World_Water_Development_Report" title="UN World Water Development Report">UN World Water Development Report</a> (WWDR, 2003) from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Water_Assessment_Program" title="World Water Assessment Program">World Water Assessment Program</a> indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygiene</a>.

In 2004, the UK charity <a href="/wiki/WaterAid" title="WaterAid">WaterAid</a> reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> disposal; see <a href="/wiki/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilet</a>.</p>

<p>Water is considered a purifier in most religions.

Immersion (or <a href="/wiki/Aspersion" title="Aspersion">aspersion</a> or <a href="/wiki/Affusion" title="Affusion">affusion</a>) of a person in water is a central <a href="/wiki/Sacrament" title="Sacrament">sacrament</a> of Christianity (where it is called <a href="/wiki/Baptism" title="Baptism">baptism</a>); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (<i><a href="/wiki/Ghusl" title="Ghusl">Ghusl</a></i>), Judaism (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mikvah" title="Mikvah">mikvah</a></i>) and <a href="/wiki/Sikhism" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amrit_Sanskar" title="Amrit Sanskar">Amrit Sanskar</a></i>). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (<i><a href="/wiki/Wudu" title="Wudu">wudu</a></i>), unless water is unavailable (see <i><a href="/wiki/Tayammum" title="Tayammum">Tayammum</a></i>). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of <i><a href="/wiki/Misogi" title="Misogi">misogi</a></i>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy">Philosophy</span></h3>
<p>The Ancient Greek philosopher <a href="/wiki/Empedocles" title="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> held that water is one of the four <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Classical_elements" title="Classical elements">classical elements</a> along with <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>, earth and <a href="/wiki/Air_(classical_element)" title="Air (classical element)">air</a>, and was regarded as the <a href="/wiki/Ylem" title="Ylem">ylem</a>, or basic substance of the universe. <a href="/wiki/Thales" title="Thales">Thales</a>, who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monist" title="Monist">monist</a>, believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an <a href="/wiki/Icosahedron" title="Icosahedron">icosahedron</a> which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.</p>
<p>In the theory of the <a href="/wiki/Humorism" title="Humorism">four bodily humors</a>, water was associated with <a href="/wiki/Phlegm" title="Phlegm">phlegm</a>, as being cold and moist. The <a href="/wiki/Water_(classical_element)" title="Water (classical element)">classical element of water</a> was also one of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_elements_(Chinese_philosophy)" title="Five elements (Chinese philosophy)">five elements</a> in traditional <a href="/wiki/Chinese_philosophy" title="Chinese philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Earth_(classical_element)" title="Earth (classical element)">earth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fire_(classical_element)" title="Fire (classical element)">fire</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wood_(classical_element)" title="Wood (classical element)">wood</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Metal_(classical_element)" title="Metal (classical element)">metal</a>.</p>
<p>Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge's 1891 translation of the Dao De Jing states "The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao" and "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed." <i><a href="/wiki/Guanzi_(text)" title="Guanzi (text)">Guanzi</a></i> in "Shui di" 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water, proclaiming that "man is water" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.</p>
