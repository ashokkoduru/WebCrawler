<p><b>Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage</b> (<b>BECCS</b>) is a future <a href="/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation" title="Climate change mitigation">greenhouse gas mitigation</a> technology which produces <a href="/wiki/Negative_carbon_dioxide_emission" title="Negative carbon dioxide emission">negative carbon dioxide emissions</a> by combining <a href="/wiki/Bioenergy" title="Bioenergy">bioenergy</a> (energy from <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a>) use with <a href="/wiki/Geology" title="Geology">geologic</a> <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a>. The concept of BECCS is drawn from the integration of trees and crops, which extract carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere as they grow, the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants, and the application of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> via CO<sub>2</sub> injection into geological formations.

<p>The main appeal of BECCS is in its ability to result in negative emissions of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a>. The capture of carbon dioxide from <a href="/wiki/Bioenergy" title="Bioenergy">bioenergy</a> sources effectively removes CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Bio-energy is derived from biomass which is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Renewable_energy_source" title="Renewable energy source">renewable energy source</a> and serves as a carbon sink during its growth. During industrial processes, the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. The process thus results in a net zero emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth, transport and processing, see below under environmental considerations. <a href="/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">Carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS) technology serves to intercept the release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations. CO<sub>2</sub> with a biomass origin is not only released from biomass fuelled power plants, but also during the production of <a href="/wiki/Pulp_(paper)" title="Pulp (paper)">pulp</a> used to make paper and in the production of biofuels such as <a href="/wiki/Biogas" title="Biogas">biogas</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bioethanol" title="Bioethanol">bioethanol</a>. The BECCS technology can also be employed on such industrial processes.</p>
<p>It is argued that through the BECCS technology, carbon dioxide is trapped in geologic formations for very long periods of time, whereas for example a tree only stores its carbon during its lifetime. In its report on the CCS technology, IPCC projects that more than 99% of carbon dioxide which is stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years. While other types of carbon sinks such as the ocean, trees and soil may involve the risk of negative feedback loops at increased temperatures, BECCS technology is likely to provide a better permanence by storing CO<sub>2</sub> in geological formations.</p>
<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that has been released to date is believed to be too much to be able to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil in order to reach low emission targets. In addition to the presently accumulated emissions, there will be significant additional emissions during this century, even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios. BECCS has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions. This implies that the emissions would not only be zero, but negative, so that not only the emissions, but the absolute amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere would be reduced.</p>

<p>The main technology for CO<sub>2</sub> capture from biotic sources generally employs the same technology as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources. Broadly, three different types of technologies exist: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Post_combustion_capture" title="Post combustion capture">post-combustion</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Pre-combustion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Pre-combustion (page does not exist)">pre-combustion</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Oxy-fuel_combustion_process" title="Oxy-fuel combustion process">oxy-fuel combustion</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost">Cost</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainable</a> technical potential for net negative emissions with BECCS has been estimated to 10 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigatonne" title="Gigatonne">Gt</a> of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent annually, with an economic potential of up to 3.5 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent annually at a cost of less than 50 €/tonne, and up to 3.9 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent annually at a cost of less than 100 €/tonne.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Policy">Policy</span></h2>
<p>Based on the current <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> agreement, carbon capture and storage projects are not applicable as an emission reduction tool to be used for the <a href="/wiki/Clean_Development_Mechanism" title="Clean Development Mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism</a> (CDM) or for <a href="/wiki/Joint_Implementation" title="Joint Implementation">Joint Implementation</a> (JI) projects. Recognising CCS technologies as an emission reduction tool is vital for the implementation of such plants as there is no other financial motivation for the implementation of such systems. There has been growing support to have fossil CCS and BECCS included in the protocol. Accounting studies on how this can be implemented, including BECCS, have also been done.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Techno-economics_of_BECCS_and_the_TESBiC_Project">Techno-economics of BECCS and the TESBiC Project</span></h2>
<p>The largest and most detailed techno-economic assessment of BECCS was carried out by cmcl innovations and the TESBiC group (Techno-Economic Study of Biomass to CCS) in 2012. This project recommended the most promising set of biomass fuelled power generation technologies coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The project outcomes lead to a detailed “biomass CCS roadmap” for the U.K..</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_considerations">Environmental considerations</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Issues_relating_to_biofuels" title="Issues relating to biofuels">Issues relating to biofuels</a></div>
<p>Some of the environmental considerations and other concerns about the widespread implementation of BECCS are similar to those of CCS. However, much of the critique towards CCS is that it may strengthen the dependency on depletable fossil fuels and environmentally invasive coal mining. This is not the case with BECCS, as it relies on renewable biomass. There are however other considerations which involve BECCS and these concerns are related to the possible increased use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biofuels" title="Biofuels">biofuels</a>.</p>
<p>Biomass production is subject to a range of sustainability constraints, such as: scarcity of arable land and fresh water, loss of biodiversity, competition with food production, <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> and scarcity of phosphorus. It is important to make sure that biomass is used in a way that maximizes both energy and climate benefits. There has been criticism to some suggested BECCS deployment scenarios, where there would be a very heavy reliance on increased biomass input.</p>
<p>These systems may have other negative side effects. There is however presently no need to expand the use of biofuels in energy or industry applications to allow for BECCS deployment. There is already today considerable emissions from point sources of biomass derived CO<sub>2</sub>, which could be utilized for BECCS. Though, in possible future bio-energy system upscaling scenarios, this may be an important consideration.</p>
<p>The BECCS process allows CO<sub>2</sub> to be collected and stored directly from the atmosphere, rather than from a fossil source. This implies that any eventual emissions from storage may be recollected and restored simply by reiterating the BECCS-process. This is not possible with CCS alone, as CO<sub>2</sub> emitted to the atmosphere cannot be restored by burning more fossil fuel with CCS.</p>
