<p><b>Electricity retailing</b> is the final sale of <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> from <a href="/wiki/Electricity_generation" title="Electricity generation">generation</a> to the end-use consumer.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Beginnings">Beginnings</span></h2>
<p>Electricity <a href="/wiki/Retail" title="Retail">retailing</a> began at the end of the 19th century when the bodies which generated electricity for their own use made supply available to third parties. In the beginning, electricity was primarily used for street <a href="/wiki/Lighting" title="Lighting">lighting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tram" title="Tram">trams</a>. The public could buy once large scale electric companies had been started.</p>
<p>The provision of these services was generally the responsibility of electric companies or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Municipal_authorities" title="Municipal authorities">municipal authorities</a> who either set up their own departments or contracted the services from private entrepreneurs. Residential, commercial and industrial use of electricity was confined, initially, to lighting but this changed dramatically with the development of <a href="/wiki/Electric_motor" title="Electric motor">electric motors</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_heater" title="Electric heater">heaters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communication" title="Communication">communication</a> devices.</p>
<p>The basic principle of supply has not changed much over time. The amount of energy used by the domestic consumer, and thus the amount charged for, is measured through an <a href="/wiki/Electricity_meter" title="Electricity meter">electricity meter</a> that is usually placed near the input of a home to provide easy access to the meter reader.</p>
<p>Customers are usually charged a monthly service fee and additional charges based on the electrical energy (in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/KWh" title="KWh">kWh</a>) consumed by the household or business during the month. Commercial and industrial consumers normally have more complex pricing schemes. These require meters that measure the energy usage in time intervals (such as a half-hour) to impose charges based on both the amount of energy consumed and the maximum rate of consumption, i.e. the maximum demand, which is measured in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kilovolt-ampere" title="Kilovolt-ampere">kVA</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Monopoly_supply">Monopoly supply</span></h2>
<p>The rapid growth in electric appliance usage in the early part of the 20th century contributed to an explosive growth in <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electrification</a> around the world.</p>
<p>The supply of electricity to homes, offices, shops, factories, farms, and mines became the responsibility of <a href="/wiki/Public_utility" title="Public utility">public utilities</a>, which were either private organizations subject to <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulation</a> or public authorities owned by local, state or national bodies.</p>
<p>In some countries a statutory or <a href="/wiki/Government-granted_monopoly" title="Government-granted monopoly">government-granted monopoly</a> was created, which was controlled by legislation (for example <a href="/wiki/Eskom" title="Eskom">Eskom</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>).</p>
<p>Electricity retailing in the period from approximately 1890 to 1990 consisted of managing the connection, disconnection and billing of electricity consumers by the local monopoly supplier.</p>
<p>In many utilities there was a <a href="/wiki/Marketing" title="Marketing">marketing</a> function which encouraged electricity usage when there was excess capacity to supply and encouraged conservation when supply was tight.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_a_market">Creating a market</span></h2>
<p>An electricity provider is often known as "the <b><a href="/wiki/Electric_power_industry" title="Electric power industry">electric company</a></b>" or "the <b>power company</b>".</p>
<p>In 1990 there was a significant development in the way electricity was bought and sold. In many countries, the <a href="/wiki/Electricity_market" title="Electricity market">electricity market</a> was <a href="/wiki/Deregulation" title="Deregulation">deregulated</a> to open up the supply of electricity to competition. In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electricity_supply_industry" title="Electricity supply industry">electricity supply industry</a> was radically reformed to establish competition, including a market in <a href="/wiki/Energy_switching_services_in_the_UK" title="Energy switching services in the UK">advising users about switching supplier</a>. This trend continued in other countries (see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Electricity_Market" title="New Zealand Electricity Market">New Zealand Electricity Market</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deregulation" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a>) and the role of electricity retailing changed from what was essentially an administrative function within an integrated utility to become a risk management function within a competitive <a href="/wiki/Electricity_market" title="Electricity market">electricity market</a>.</p>
<p>Electricity retailers now offer fixed prices or variable for electricity to their customers and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Spot_markets&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Spot markets (page does not exist)">spot markets</a> or <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Electricity_pools&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Electricity pools (page does not exist)">electricity pools</a>. This development has not been without casualties. The most notable example of poor risk management (coupled with poor market regulation) was the <a href="/wiki/California_electricity_crisis" title="California electricity crisis">2001 California electricity crisis</a>, when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric" title="Pacific Gas and Electric">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> and <a href="/wiki/Southern_California_Edison" title="Southern California Edison">Southern California Edison</a> were driven into bankruptcy by having to purchase electricity at high spot prices and sell at low fixed rates.</p>
<p>Customers may choose from a number of competing suppliers. They may also opt to purchase <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_electricity" title="Green electricity">"green" power</a>, i.e. electricity sourced from <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> generation such as <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> or <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h2>
<p>Over the past several decades, many US states have moved to deregulate their electric markets, with 24 states allowing for at least some competition among retail electric providers (REPs) including <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_York_(state)" title="New York (state)">New York</a>. These companies include <a href="/wiki/Ambit_Energy" title="Ambit Energy">Ambit Energy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings" title="Energy Future Holdings">TXU</a>, <a href="/wiki/Just_Energy" title="Just Energy">Just Energy</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Con_Edison" title="Con Edison">Con Edison</a>, <a href="/wiki/Champion_Energy" title="Champion Energy">Champion Energy</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Constellation_Energy" title="Constellation Energy">Constellation Energy</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reliant_Energy" title="Reliant Energy">Reliant Energy</a> among many others. Deregulation of electric retailers has been subject to much controversy as more states have opted for competitive markets.</p>
