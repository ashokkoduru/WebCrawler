<p>The net <b>capacity factor</b> of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_plant" title="Power plant">power plant</a> is the ratio of its actual output over a period of time, to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full <a href="/wiki/Nameplate_capacity" title="Nameplate capacity">nameplate capacity</a> continuously over the same period of time. To calculate the capacity factor, take the total amount of <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity. Capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of <a href="/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a> that is used and the design of the plant. The capacity factor should not be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Availability_factor" title="Availability factor">availability factor</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Capacity_credit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Capacity credit (page does not exist)">capacity credit</a> (firm capacity) or with <a href="/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency" title="Energy conversion efficiency">efficiency</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nuclear_power_plant">Nuclear power plant</span></h3>

<p>A nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatts</a> (MW) might produce 648,000 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Megawatt-hour" title="Megawatt-hour">megawatt-hours</a> (MW·h) in a 30-day month. The number of megawatt-hours that would have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity can be determined by multiplying the plant's maximum capacity by the number of hours in the time period. 1,000 MW × 30 days × 24 hours/day is 720,000 MW·h. The capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual output with the maximum possible output. In this case, the capacity factor is 0.9 (90%).</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station" title="Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station">Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station</a> is the largest nuclear plant in the US with a nameplate capacity of 3,942 MW between its three reactors. With an annual generation of 31,200,000 MWh in 2010, the capacity factor was 90.4%.</p>

<p>Each of Palo Verde’s three reactors is refueled every 18 months, with one refueling every spring and fall. In 2014, a refueling was completed in a record 28 days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wind_farm">Wind farm</span></h3>
<p>The Danish wind farm <a href="/wiki/Horns_Rev_2" title="Horns Rev 2">Horns Rev 2</a>, the world's largest in 2009, comprises 91 <a href="/wiki/Siemens_Wind_Power" title="Siemens Wind Power">Siemens</a> SWT-2.3-93 wind turbines each of 2.3 MW, with a nominal total capacity of 209 MW.</p>
<p>In 2012, the wind farm generated 956  GW·h of electricity. The capacity factor for this wind farm was 52.1%.</p>

<p>Onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60%, for example the 44 MW Eolo plant in Nicaragua had a net generation of 232.132 MWh in 2015, equivalent to a capacity factor of 60.2%.</p>
<p>Note that capacity factor is not constrained by the <a href="/wiki/Betz%27s_law" title="Betz's law">Betz limit</a> so capacities higher that 59.2% are possible. This is because capacity measures actual production relative to possible production by the turbine, as opposed to production vs. energy available in the wind.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydroelectric_dam">Hydroelectric dam</span></h3>
<p>Large rivers or large reservoirs in wet mountainous areas are ideal water supplies for <a href="/wiki/Hydropower" title="Hydropower">hydropower</a>, in Western Canada the Peace and Columbia rivers support capacity factors averaging 85% of a 10,000MW capacity in the mild, rainy oceanic climate.</p>
<p> As of 2010, <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> is the largest power generating station in the world by nameplate capacity. In 2009, not yet fully complete, it had 26 main generator units @ 700 MW and two auxiliary generator units @ 50 MW for a total installed capacity of 18,300 MW. Total generation in 2009 was 79.47 TW·h, for a capacity factor of just under 50%:</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> has a nameplate capacity of 2080 MW and an annual generation averaging 4.2 TW·h. (The annual generation has varied between a high of 10.348 TW·h in 1984, and a low of 2.648 TW·h in 1956.) Taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reasons_for_reduced_capacity_factor">Reasons for reduced capacity factor</span></h2>

<p>There are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100%. The first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance. This accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants. Base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output. <a href="/wiki/Geothermal_power" title="Geothermal power">Geothermal plants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear plants</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_plant" title="Fossil fuel power plant">coal-fired plants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bioenergy" title="Bioenergy">bioenergy plants</a> that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants.</p>
<p>The second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100% is that output is curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical. This accounts for most of the unused capacity of <a href="/wiki/Peaking_power_plant" title="Peaking power plant">peaking power plants</a>. Peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day. Their electricity is relatively expensive. However, it is only relatively expensive if determining the cost per unit of electricity be dividing total costs of production and operation by the power produced. Its electricity may be "relatively expensive", but the cost to construct and operate and maintain the plant may be a fraction of those of a mainline powerplant. Clearly a peaking powerplant is not constructed to cheaply produce electricity. It is constructed to increase the efficiency and therefore reduce the costs of the utility as a whole. If the alternative to "expensive" peaking power is selling no power during periods of excessive demand that create blackouts or damage to equipment and facilities during brownouts, the peaking power becomes very cheap very quickly.</p>
<p>Many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or times of the year because of variation in loads and electricity prices. If a plant is only needed during the day, for example, even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day all year long, it would only have a 50% Capacity factor, e.g. That assertion falls apart if the power plant was designed and constructed for that exact purpose. If a powerplant is designed, intended and constructed or even later simply allocated and used to produce electrictity 12 hours per day, its capacity factor is 100% rather than 50%. Put another way, does any person consider themselves lazy 66% of the time simply because they only work 8 hours of a 24-hour day?</p>
<p>A third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time. This can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies, but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources. When the sun isn't shining, solar PV cannot produce electricity. When the wind is not blowing, wind turbines cannot produce electricity. Solar PV and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their "fuel", sunshine and wind respectively. Again, the flawed concept of "capacity factor" equates inactivity directly to inefficiency. While wind turbines don't produce power when there is no wind, they're also not being subjected to the wear and tear that come with operation. And calm periods allow maintenance and repairs to be performed without removing the unit from service when it could be operating.</p>
<p>A hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100% due to scarcity of water. However, its output may also simply be regulated to match the current power need, conserving its stored water for later usage. A hydroelectricity plant may also be designed for reverse usage so it can pump water up in its reservoir in situations with a power surplus. In both cases the use of the hydroelectricity plant to stabilize the grid reduces its capacity factor.</p>
<p>Hydroelectricity may have a higher capacity factor with respect to the turbine size since in some case the amount of stored water fluctuates to account for intermittent availability of water. Given the nearly impossible task of actually designing and constructing a hydroelectric facility to deliver the precise waterflow required to operate the generators at nameplate capacity, applying the already dubious "capacity factor" to hydroelectric powerplants borders on absurdity.</p>
<p>In many cases, hydroelectric power production is a secondary function of the dam and reservoir and it is used only to produce and sell power to produce revenue used to offset the costs of operating and maintaining the dam and reservoir. Some dams and reservoirs were primarily built for flood control or irrigation and are operated to perform those functions as required with electricity production occurring only when it is economically feasible and profitable to do so.</p>
<p>Even an apparently "full" reservoir may not be sufficient to power a hydroelectric powerplant to its rated output. Typically hydroelectric plants are rated using a specific "head" determined to be the minimum water leve required to produce 100% capacity. However, the temperature and density of the water determine the kinetic energy it will produce as it travels from inlet to generator turbine. Additional factors such as fouling of the spillway or piping, wear and damage of the turbine rotor and backpressure downstream from the turbine can also reduce capacity even with ideal "head" available.</p>
<p>Further, since inflow into reservoirs is constantly changing and variable as are various other conditions affecting the amount of time required for water to "transit" the reservoir and hydroelectric plant, designing and building a hydroelectric plant capable of perfectly matching generating capacity to water availability is impossible.</p>
<p>Reservoirs are constantly although perhaps imperceptibly rising and falling with resulting changes in generating capacity. And in reservoir/powerplant systems where a constant head can be maintained, it is invariable maintained by allowing excess water to exit the reservoir through spillways that bypass the generators. In such installation, water released to bypass is wasted entirely for purposes of generating electricity even when bypassing it increases the efficiency and capacity of the powerplant itself.</p>
<p>Other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100% include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output.</p>
<p>By far the biggest reality affecting "capacity factor" is the need to perform periodic maintenance on components and systems within the powerplant and to replace or repair components when they fail or reach the end of their designed service life. Because electricity is readily available with the flip of switch all around us, it is easy for some people to forget that powerplants are mechanical devices and systems and eventually they wear out. This reality makes the entire concept of "capacity factor" even more questionable given that the closer to its supposedly ideal "capacity factor" of 100% a powerplant is operated, the more maintenance and repair it will require. As such, a 100% "capacity factor" is now only imposssible to achieve, it would be undesirable to do so if it were possible.</p>
<p>Running a powerplant at 100% "capacity factor" until something catastrophically fails or wear prevents safe or efficient operation would be analogous to driving your car at its maximum speed as long as possible as often as possible in order to wear it out as quickly as possible and maximize ownership costs as much as possible. But while a mechanic can install a new engine in your car in a few days, major repairs and maintenance tasks in powerplants can require shutdown for weeks, months and even years in some cases.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Load_following_power_plants">Load following power plants</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Load_following_power_plant" title="Load following power plant">Load following power plants</a>, also called intermediate power plants, are in between these extremes in terms of capacity factor, efficiency and cost per unit of electricity. They produce most of their electricity during the day, when prices and demand are highest. However, the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Capacity_factor_and_renewable_energy">Capacity factor and renewable energy</span></h2>

<p>When it comes to several <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> sources such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, there is a fourth reason for unused capacity. The plant may be capable of producing electricity, but its "fuel" (<a href="/wiki/Wind" title="Wind">wind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> or <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>) may not be available. A hydroelectric plant's production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> downstream. However, solar, wind and hydroelectric plants do have high <a href="/wiki/Availability_factor" title="Availability factor">availability factors</a>, so when they have fuel available, they are almost always able to produce electricity.</p>
<p>When hydroelectric plants have water available, they are also useful for load following, because of their high <i>dispatchability</i>. A typical hydroelectric plant's operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">Wind farms</a> are variable, due to the natural variability of the wind. For a wind farm, the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind. Transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45%, though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55% capacity factor, and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65% capacity factor.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">Solar energy</a> is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth, seasonal changes, and because of cloud cover. According to, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District observed a 15% capacity factor in 2005. However, according to the <a href="/wiki/SolarPACES" title="SolarPACES">SolarPACES</a> programme of the <a href="/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" title="International Energy Agency">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA), solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_in_Spain" title="Solar power in Spain">Spain</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Solar_power_plants_in_the_Mojave_Desert" title="Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert">south-western United States</a>, although in some locations solar PV does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced. SolarPACES states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_thermal_power" title="Solar thermal power">solar thermal power</a> (CSP) stations can be extended to become dispatchable (load following). The IEA CSP Technology Roadmap (2010) suggests that "in the sunniest countries, CSP can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020, and of base-load power by 2025 to 2030". A dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geothermal" title="Geothermal">Geothermal</a> has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources, and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. While the carrier medium for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geothermal_electricity" title="Geothermal electricity">geothermal electricity</a> (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available for the foreseeable future. Geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth.</p>
