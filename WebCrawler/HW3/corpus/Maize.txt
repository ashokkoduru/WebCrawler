<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>Most historians believe maize was domesticated in the <a href="/wiki/Tehuac%C3%A1n_Valley_matorral" title="Tehuacán Valley matorral">Tehuacan Valley</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Recent research modified this view somewhat; scholars now indicate the adjacent <a href="/wiki/Balsas_River" title="Balsas River">Balsas River</a> Valley of south-central Mexico as the center of domestication.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Olmec" title="Olmec">Olmec</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maya_peoples" title="Maya peoples">Mayans</a> cultivated maize in numerous varieties throughout Mesoamerica, cooked, ground or processed through <a href="/wiki/Nixtamalization" title="Nixtamalization">nixtamalization</a>. Beginning about 2500 BC, the crop spread through much of the <a href="/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>. The region developed a trade network based on surplus and varieties of maize crops.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, recent data indicates that the spread of maize took place even earlier. According to Piperno,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A large corpus of data indicates that it [maize] was dispersed into lower Central America by 7600 BP [5600 BC] and had moved into the inter-Andean valleys of Colombia between 7000 and 6000 BP [5000-4000 BC]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then, even earlier dates have been published.</p>
<p>After European contact with the Americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, explorers and traders <a href="/wiki/Columbian_Exchange" title="Columbian Exchange">carried maize back to Europe</a> and introduced it to other countries. Maize spread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates. Sugar-rich varieties called <a href="/wiki/Sweet_corn" title="Sweet corn">sweet corn</a> are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while <a href="/wiki/Field_corn" title="Field corn">field corn</a> varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into <a href="/wiki/Cornmeal" title="Cornmeal">cornmeal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Masa" title="Masa">masa</a>, pressing into <a href="/wiki/Corn_oil" title="Corn oil">corn oil</a>, and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like <a href="/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey" title="Bourbon whiskey">bourbon whiskey</a>), and as chemical feedstocks.</p>
<p>An influential 2002 study by Matsuoka <i>et al</i>. has demonstrated that, rather than the multiple independent domestications model, all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. The study also demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands. Later, maize spread from this region over the Americas along two major paths. This is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands.</p>
<p>Before they were domesticated, maize plants only grew small, 25 millimetres (1 in) long corn cobs, and only one per plant. Many centuries of artificial selection by the indigenous people of the Americas resulted in the development of maize plants capable of growing several cobs per plant that were usually several centimetres/inches long each.</p>
<p>Maize is the most widely grown grain <a href="/wiki/Crop" title="Crop">crop</a> throughout the Americas, with 332 million <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">metric tons</a> grown annually in the United States alone. Approximately 40% of the crop—130 million tons—is used for corn <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>. <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_maize" title="Genetically modified maize">Genetically modified maize</a> made up 85% of the maize planted in the United States in 2009.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h2>

<p>The word <i>maize</i> derives from the Spanish form of the indigenous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people" title="Taíno people">Taíno</a> word for the plant, <i>mahiz</i>. It is known by other names around the world.</p>
<p>The word "corn" outside North America, Australia, and New Zealand refers to any <a href="/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereal</a> crop, its meaning understood to vary geographically to refer to the local <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple</a>. In the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, <i>corn</i> primarily means maize; this usage started as a shortening of "Indian corn". "Indian corn" primarily means maize (the staple grain of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indigenous_Americans" title="Indigenous Americans">indigenous Americans</a>), but can refer more specifically to multicolored "<a href="/wiki/Flint_corn" title="Flint corn">flint corn</a>" used for decoration.</p>
<p>In places outside North America, Australia, and New Zealand, <i>corn</i> often refers to maize in culinary contexts. The narrower meaning is usually indicated by some additional word, as in <i><a href="/wiki/Sweet_corn" title="Sweet corn">sweet corn</a></i>, <i>sweetcorn</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Corn_on_the_cob" title="Corn on the cob">corn on the cob</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Baby_corn" title="Baby corn">baby corn</a></i>, the puffed confection known as <i><a href="/wiki/Popcorn" title="Popcorn">popcorn</a></i> and the breakfast cereal known as <i><a href="/wiki/Corn_flakes" title="Corn flakes">corn flakes</a></i>.</p>
<p>In Southern Africa, maize is commonly called <i>mielie</i> (<a href="/wiki/Afrikaans" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>) or <i>mealie</i> (<a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a>), words derived from the Portuguese word for maize, <i>milho</i>.</p>
<p><i>Maize</i> is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike <i>corn</i>, which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region. <i>Maize</i> is used by agricultural bodies and <a href="/wiki/Research_institute" title="Research institute">research institutes</a> such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FAO" title="FAO">FAO</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CSIRO" title="CSIRO">CSIRO</a>. National agricultural and industry associations often include the word <i>maize</i> in their name even in English-speaking countries where the local, informal word is something other than <i>maize</i>; for example, the Maize Association of Australia, the Indian Maize Development Association, the Kenya Maize Consortium and Maize Breeders Network, the National Maize Association of Nigeria, the Zimbabwe Seed Maize Association. However, in commodities trading, <i>corn</i> consistently refers to maize and not other grains.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure_and_physiology">Structure and physiology</span></h2>
<p>The maize plant is often 3 m (10 ft) in height, though some natural strains can grow 12 m (39 ft). The stem is commonly composed of 20 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internode_(botany)" title="Internode (botany)">internodes</a>  of 18 cm (7.1 in) length. A leaf, which grows from each node, is generally 9 cm (4 in) in width and 120 cm (4 ft) in length.</p>
<p>Ears develop above a few of the leaves in the midsection of the plant, between the stem and leaf sheath, elongating by ~3 mm/day, to a length of 18 cm (7 in)  with 60 cm (24 in) being the maximum alleged in the subspecies. They are female <a href="/wiki/Inflorescence" title="Inflorescence">inflorescences</a>, tightly enveloped by several layers of ear leaves commonly called husks. Certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears. These are the source of the "<a href="/wiki/Baby_corn" title="Baby corn">baby corn</a>" used as a vegetable in <a href="/wiki/Asian_cuisine" title="Asian cuisine">Asian cuisine</a>.</p>
<p>The apex of the stem ends in the tassel, an <a href="/wiki/Inflorescence" title="Inflorescence">inflorescence</a> of male flowers. When the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the tassel <a href="/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)" title="Dehiscence (botany)">dehisce</a> and release pollen. Maize pollen is <a href="/wiki/Anemophily" title="Anemophily">anemophilous</a> (dispersed by wind), and because of its large settling velocity, most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel.</p>
<p>Elongated <a href="/wiki/Stigma_(botany)" title="Stigma (botany)">stigmas</a>, called <a href="/wiki/Corn_silk" title="Corn silk">silks</a>, emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear. They are often pale yellow and 18 cm (7 in) in length, like tufts of hair in appearance. At the end of each is a carpel, which may develop into a "kernel" if fertilized by a pollen grain. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pericarp" title="Pericarp">pericarp</a> of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as "<a href="/wiki/Caryopsis" title="Caryopsis">caryopsis</a>", typical of the <a href="/wiki/Poaceae" title="Poaceae">grasses</a>, and the entire kernel is often referred to as the "<a href="/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seed</a>". The cob is close to a <a href="/wiki/Multiple_fruit" title="Multiple fruit">multiple fruit</a> in structure, except that the individual fruits (the kernels) never fuse into a single mass. The grains are about the size of <a href="/wiki/Pea" title="Pea">peas</a>, and adhere in regular rows around a white, pithy substance, which forms the ear. The maximum size of kernels is reputedly 2.5 cm (1 in). An ear commonly holds 600 kernels. They are of various colors: blackish, <a href="/wiki/Blue_corn" title="Blue corn">bluish-gray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Purple_corn" title="Purple corn">purple</a>, green, red, white and yellow. When ground into <a href="/wiki/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, maize yields more flour with much less <a href="/wiki/Bran" title="Bran">bran</a> than wheat does. It lacks the protein <a href="/wiki/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a> of wheat and, therefore, makes baked goods with poor rising capability. A <a href="/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">genetic variant</a> that accumulates more sugar and less <a href="/wiki/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a> in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called <a href="/wiki/Sweet_corn" title="Sweet corn">sweet corn</a>. Young ears can be consumed raw, with the <a href="/wiki/Corncob" title="Corncob">cob</a> and silk, but as the plant matures (usually during the summer months), the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility. By the end of the <a href="/wiki/Growing_season" title="Growing season">growing season</a>, the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them tender first in boiling water.</p>

<p>Planting density affects multiple aspects of maize. Modern farming techniques in <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed countries</a> usually rely on dense planting, which produces one ear per stalk. Stands of <a href="/wiki/Silage" title="Silage">silage</a> maize are yet denser, and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter.</p>
<p>Maize is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Long-night_plant" title="Long-night plant">facultative short-day plant</a>  and flowers in a certain number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Growing_degree_day" title="Growing degree day">growing degree days</a> &gt; 10 °C (50 °F) in the environment to which it is adapted. The magnitude of the influence that long nights have on the number of days that must pass before maize <a href="/wiki/Flower" title="Flower">flowers</a> is genetically prescribed and regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Phytochrome" title="Phytochrome">phytochrome</a> system. <a href="/wiki/Circadian_rhythm" title="Circadian rhythm">Photoperiodicity</a> can be eccentric in tropical <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> such that the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall that they do not have enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost. These attributes, however, may prove useful in using tropical maize for <a href="/wiki/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a>.</p>
<p>Immature maize shoots accumulate a powerful antibiotic substance, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (<a href="/wiki/DIMBOA" title="DIMBOA">DIMBOA</a>). DIMBOA is a member of a group of <a href="/wiki/Hydroxamic_acid" title="Hydroxamic acid">hydroxamic acids</a> (also known as benzoxazinoids) that serve as a natural defense against a wide range of pests, including insects, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pathogenic" title="Pathogenic">pathogenic</a> fungi and <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>. DIMBOA is also found in related grasses, particularly wheat. A maize mutant (bx) lacking DIMBOA is highly susceptible to attack by <a href="/wiki/Aphid" title="Aphid">aphids</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>. DIMBOA is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the <a href="/wiki/European_corn_borer" title="European corn borer">European corn borer</a> (family <a href="/wiki/Crambidae" title="Crambidae">Crambidae</a>). As maize matures, DIMBOA levels and resistance to the corn borer decline.</p>
<p>Because of its shallow roots, maize is susceptible to droughts, intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils, and prone to be uprooted by severe winds.</p>

<p>While yellow maizes derive their color from <a href="/wiki/Lutein" title="Lutein">lutein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zeaxanthin" title="Zeaxanthin">zeaxanthin</a>, in red-colored maizes, the kernel coloration is due to <a href="/wiki/Anthocyanin" title="Anthocyanin">anthocyanins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phlobaphene" title="Phlobaphene">phlobaphenes</a>. These latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway from polymerisation of <a href="/wiki/Flavan-4-ol" title="Flavan-4-ol">flavan-4-ols</a> by the expression of maize pericarp color1 (p1) gene which encodes an R2R3 <a href="/wiki/MYB_(gene)" title="MYB (gene)">myb</a>-like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transcriptional_activator" title="Transcriptional activator">transcriptional activator</a> of the A1 gene encoding for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dihydroflavonol_4-reductase" title="Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase">dihydroflavonol 4-reductase</a> (reducing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dihydroflavonol" title="Dihydroflavonol">dihydroflavonols</a> into flavan-4-ols) while another gene (Suppressor of Pericarp Pigmentation 1 or SPP1) acts as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transcriptional_suppressor" title="Transcriptional suppressor">suppressor</a>. The p1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments, while the P1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs, and unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1) modifies P1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp, as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments. The maize P gene encodes a Myb homolog that recognizes the sequence CCT/AACC, in sharp contrast with the C/TAACGG bound by vertebrate Myb proteins.</p>

<p>Maize is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diploid" title="Diploid">diploid</a> with 20 <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" title="Chromosome">chromosomes</a> (n=10). The combined length of the chromosomes is 1500 <a href="/wiki/Centimorgan" title="Centimorgan">cM</a>. Some of the maize chromosomes have what are known as "chromosomal knobs": highly repetitive <a href="/wiki/Heterochromatin" title="Heterochromatin">heterochromatic</a> domains that stain darkly.

<p>The Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center, funded by the USDA <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_Research_Service" title="Agricultural Research Service">Agricultural Research Service</a> and located in the Department of Crop Sciences at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, is a stock center of maize mutants. The total collection has nearly 80,000 samples. The bulk of the collection consists of several hundred named genes, plus additional gene combinations and other heritable variants. There are about 1000 chromosomal aberrations (e.g., translocations and inversions) and stocks with abnormal chromosome numbers (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tetraploid" title="Tetraploid">tetraploids</a>). Genetic data describing the maize mutant stocks as well as myriad other data about maize genetics can be accessed at <a class="external text" href="http://maizegdb.org/" rel="nofollow">MaizeGDB</a>, the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database.</p>
<p>In 2005, the US <a href="/wiki/National_Science_Foundation" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF), Department of Agriculture (<a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="United States Department of Energy">Department of Energy</a> (DOE) formed a consortium to sequence the B73 maize <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. The resulting DNA sequence data was deposited immediately into <a href="/wiki/GenBank" title="GenBank">GenBank</a>, a public repository for genome-sequence data. Sequences and genome annotations have also been made available throughout the project's lifetime at the project's official site.</p>
<p>Primary sequencing of the maize genome was completed in 2008. On November 20, 2009, the consortium published results of its sequencing effort in <i>Science</i>. The genome, 85% of which is composed of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transposon" title="Transposon">transposons</a>, was found to contain 32,540 genes (By comparison, the <a href="/wiki/Human_genome" title="Human genome">human genome</a> contains about 2.9 billion bases and 26,000 genes).

<p>According to a genetic study by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Embrapa" title="Embrapa">Embrapa</a>, corn cultivation was introduced in South America from Mexico, in two great waves: the first, 5000 years ago, spread through the <a href="/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>; the second, about 2000 years ago, through the lowlands of South America.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>

<p>Maize reproduces sexually each year. This randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits found in the crop (like high yield or good nutrition) can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used.</p>
<p>Maize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on <a href="/wiki/Selection_methods_in_plant_breeding_based_on_mode_of_reproduction" title="Selection methods in plant breeding based on mode of reproduction">mass selection</a>. Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection, (C. G. Hopkins ca. 1896), hybrids made from selected <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inbred" title="Inbred">inbred</a> lines (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using 4 inbred lines (<a href="/wiki/Donald_F._Jones" title="Donald F. Jones">D. F. Jones</a> ca. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids. (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958) by the 1930s, companies such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pioneer_Hi-Bred" title="Pioneer Hi-Bred">Pioneer</a> devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development.

<p>Since the 1940s the best strains of maize have been first-generation hybrids made from inbred strains that have been optimized for specific traits, such as yield, nutrition, drought, pest and disease tolerance. Both conventional cross-breeding and genetic modification have succeeded in increasing output and reducing the need for cropland, pesticides, water and fertilizer.</p>

<p>Maize is the domesticated variant of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Teosinte" title="Teosinte">teosinte</a>. The two plants have dissimilar appearance, maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and teosinte being a short, bushy plant. The difference between the two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes.</p>
<p>Several theories had been proposed about the specific origin of maize in Mesoamerica:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a direct <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mexican_people" title="Mexican people">Mexican</a> annual <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Teosinte" title="Teosinte">teosinte</a>, <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>parviglumis</i>, native to the <a href="/wiki/Balsas_River" title="Balsas River">Balsas River</a> valley in south-eastern <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, with up to 12% of its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetic_material" title="Genetic material">genetic material</a> obtained from <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>mexicana</i> through <a href="/wiki/Introgression" title="Introgression">introgression</a>. This theory was further confirmed by the 2002 study of Matsuoka et al.</li>
<li>It has been derived from hybridization between a small domesticated maize (a slightly changed form of a wild maize) and a teosinte of section <i>Luxuriantes</i>, either <i>Z. luxurians</i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Zea_diploperennis" title="Zea diploperennis">Z. diploperennis</a></i>.</li>
<li>It has undergone two or more domestications either of a wild maize or of a teosinte. (The term "teosinte" describes all <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> and subspecies in the genus <i>Zea</i>, excluding <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>mays</i>.)</li>
<li>It has evolved from a hybridization of <i>Z. diploperennis</i> by <i><a href="/wiki/Tripsacum_dactyloides" title="Tripsacum dactyloides">Tripsacum dactyloides</a></i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the late 1930s, Paul Mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of <i><a href="/wiki/Tripsacum" title="Tripsacum">Tripsacum</a></i>, a related genus. This theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern <a href="/wiki/Genetic_testing" title="Genetic testing">genetic testing</a>, which refutes Mangelsdorf's model and the fourth listed above.</p>
<p>The teosinte origin theory was proposed by the Russian botanist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Vavilov" title="Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov">Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov</a> in 1931 and the later American <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a>-winner <a href="/wiki/George_Beadle" title="George Beadle">George Beadle</a> in 1932. It is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants' genomes. Teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring. A number of questions remain concerning the species, among them:</p>
<ol>
<li>how the immense diversity of the species of sect. <i>Zea</i> originated,</li>
<li>how the tiny archaeological specimens of 3500–2700 BC could have been selected from a teosinte, and</li>
<li>how domestication could have proceeded without leaving remains of teosinte or maize with teosintoid traits earlier than the earliest known until recently, dating from ca. 1100 BC.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> of maize is of particular interest to researchers—<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archaeologist" title="Archaeologist">archaeologists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">geneticists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethnobotany" title="Ethnobotany">ethnobotanists</a>, geographers, etc. The process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. Research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of <a href="/wiki/Oaxaca" title="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jalisco" title="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>, because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Connection_with_.27parviglumis.27_subspecies">Connection with 'parviglumis' subspecies</span></h3>

<p>Genetic studies led by <a href="/wiki/John_Doebley" title="John Doebley">John Doebley</a> identified <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>parviglumis</i>, native to the <a href="/wiki/Balsas_River" title="Balsas River">Balsas River</a> valley in Mexico's southwestern highlands, and also known as Balsas teosinte, as being the <a href="/wiki/Crop_wild_relative" title="Crop wild relative">crop wild relative</a> teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize. This has been confirmed by further more recent studies, which refined this hypothesis somewhat. Archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the Balsas River valley as the more likely location of early domestication; this river is not very long, so these locations are not very distant. Stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iguala,_Guerrero" title="Iguala, Guerrero">Iguala, Guerrero</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Doebley was part of the team that is credited with first finding, back in 2002, that maize had been domesticated only once, about 9000 years ago, and then spread throughout the Americas.</p>
<p>A primitive corn was being grown in southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America 7,000 years ago. Archaeological remains of early maize ears, found at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guila_Naquitz_Cave" title="Guila Naquitz Cave">Guila Naquitz Cave</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Oaxaca_Valley" title="Oaxaca Valley">Oaxaca Valley</a>, date back roughly 6,250 years; the oldest ears from caves near <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tehuac%C3%A1n,_Puebla" title="Tehuacán, Puebla">Tehuacan</a>, Puebla, date ca. 3,450 BC.</p>
<p>Maize pollen dated to 7300 cal B.P. from <a href="/wiki/San_Andr%C3%A9s_(Mesoamerican_site)" title="San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)">San Andres, Tabasco</a>, on the Caribbean coast has also been recovered.</p>
<p>As maize was introduced to new cultures, new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations. Maize was the staple food, or a major staple – along with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Squash_(plant)" title="Squash (plant)">squash</a>, Andean region <a href="/wiki/Potato" title="Potato">potato</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quinoa" title="Quinoa">quinoa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bean" title="Bean">beans</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Amaranth" title="Amaranth">amaranth</a> – of most <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pre-Columbian" title="Pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> North American, Mesoamerican, South American, and Caribbean cultures. The Mesoamerican civilization, in particular, was deeply interrelated with maize. Its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation – from the planting to the food preparation. Maize formed the Mesoamerican people's identity.</p>

<p>It is unknown what precipitated its domestication, because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell. It is possible that, early on, teosinte may have been gathered as preferred feed for domestic animals.</p>
<p>Also, back in 1939, George Beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily "popped" for human consumption, like modern popcorn. Some have argued it would have taken too many generations of <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selective breeding</a> to produce large, compressed ears for efficient cultivation. However, studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spreading_to_the_north">Spreading to the north</span></h3>
<p>Around 2500 BC, maize began to spread to the north; it was first cultivated in what is now the United States at several sites in New Mexico and Arizona, about 2100 BC.</p>
<p>During the first millennium AD, maize cultivation spread more widely in the areas north. In particular, the large-scale adoption of maize agriculture and consumption in eastern North America took place about A.D. 900. Native Americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop.</p>
<p>In 2005, research by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service" title="United States Forest Service">Forest Service</a> suggested that the rise in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago in what is now the southeastern United States corresponded with a decline of freshwater <a href="/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a>, which are very sensitive to environmental changes.</p>

<p>Because it is cold-intolerant, in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate">temperate zones</a> maize must be planted in the spring. Its <a href="/wiki/Root_system" title="Root system">root system</a> is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a C4 plant (a plant that uses <a href="/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation" title="C4 carbon fixation">C4 carbon fixation</a>), maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than C3 plants (plants that use <a href="/wiki/C3_carbon_fixation" title="C3 carbon fixation">C3 carbon fixation</a>) like the small grains, <a href="/wiki/Alfalfa" title="Alfalfa">alfalfa</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soybeans" title="Soybeans">soybeans</a>. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize were "knee-high by the <a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="Independence Day (United States)">Fourth of July</a>", although modern <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrids</a> generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for <a href="/wiki/Silage" title="Silage">silage</a> is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the "milk stage", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field maize is left in the field very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact, sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring. The importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, where periodic <a href="/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">drought</a> regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a>. Although it is grown mainly in wet, hot climates, it has been said to thrive in cold, hot, dry or wet conditions, meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop.</p>

<p>Maize was planted by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Native_American_(Americas)" title="Native American (Americas)">Native Americans</a> in hills, in a complex system known to some as the <a href="/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture)" title="Three Sisters (agriculture)">Three Sisters</a>. Maize provided support for <a href="/wiki/Bean" title="Bean">beans</a>, and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing <a href="/wiki/Rhizobia" title="Rhizobia">rhizobia</a> bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other <a href="/wiki/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a>; and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Squash_(fruit)" title="Squash (fruit)">squashes</a> provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil. This method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill 60–120 cm (2.0–3.9 ft) apart was planted with three or four seeds, a method still used by home gardeners. A later technique was "checked maize", where hills were placed 40 in (1.0 m) apart in each direction, allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions. In more arid lands, this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of 10–12 cm (3.9–4.7 in) deep furrows to collect water. Modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young, although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some Native American reservations. When maize is planted in rows, it also allows for planting of other crops between these rows to make more efficient use of land space.</p>
<p>In North America, fields are often planted in a two-<a href="/wiki/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">crop rotation</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen-fixing</a> crop, often <a href="/wiki/Alfalfa" title="Alfalfa">alfalfa</a> in cooler climates and <a href="/wiki/Soybean" title="Soybean">soybeans</a> in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, <a href="/wiki/Winter_wheat" title="Winter wheat">winter wheat</a>, is added to the rotation.</p>
<p>Many of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Often the varieties have been <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetically_modified" title="Genetically modified">genetically modified</a> to tolerate <a href="/wiki/Glyphosate" title="Glyphosate">glyphosate</a> or to provide protection against natural pests. Glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance. This genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature.</p>
<p>In midwestern United States, low-till or <a href="/wiki/No-till_farming" title="No-till farming">no-till farming</a> techniques are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest. The fields are planted and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anhydrous_ammonia" title="Anhydrous ammonia">fertilized</a>. Weeds are controlled through the use of <a href="/wiki/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicides</a>, and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop. The technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming. Weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients, making them undesirable.</p>

<p>Before <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, most maize in North America was harvested by hand. This involves a large numbers of workers and associated social events (husking or shucking <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bee_(gathering)" title="Bee (gathering)">bees</a>). Some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use, but the maize <a href="/wiki/Combine_harvester" title="Combine harvester">combine</a> was not adopted until after the War. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in <a href="/wiki/Corn_crib" title="Corn crib">corn cribs</a>, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Few modern farms store maize in this manner. Most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.</p>
<p>For storing grain in bins, the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling. If the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high, <a href="/wiki/Grain_drying" title="Grain drying">grain dryers</a> are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain. This can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases (<a href="/wiki/Propane" title="Propane">propane</a> or <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>) and electricity to power the blowers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quantity">Quantity</span></h3>



<p>Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain. The United States produces 40% of the world's harvest; other top producing countries include China, Brazil, <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, India, France and <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Worldwide production was 817 million <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> in 2009—more than <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> (678 million <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> (682 million <a href="/wiki/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a>). In 2009, over 159 million <a href="/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectares</a> (390 million acres) of maize were planted worldwide, with a yield of over 5 tonnes per hectare (80 bu/acre). Production can be significantly higher in certain regions of the world; 2009 forecasts for production in Iowa were 11614 kg/ha (185 bu/acre). There is conflicting evidence to support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades. This suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle, lodging resistance, tolerance of high plant density, disease/pest tolerance, and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant.</p>

<p>"Feed maize" is being used increasingly for heating; specialized <a href="/wiki/Pellet_stove" title="Pellet stove">corn stoves</a> (similar to <a href="/wiki/Wood_fuel" title="Wood fuel">wood stoves</a>) are available and use either feed maize or wood pellets to generate heat. Maize cobs are also used as a <a href="/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a> fuel source. Maize is relatively cheap and home-heating furnaces have been developed which use maize kernels as a fuel. They feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize kernels (or wood pellets or <a href="/wiki/Cherry" title="Cherry">cherry</a> pits) into the fire.</p>
<p>Maize is increasingly used as a feedstock for the production of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fuel" title="Ethanol fuel">ethanol fuel</a>. Ethanol is mixed with gasoline to decrease the amount of pollutants emitted when used to fuel motor vehicles. High fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol, which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize. This led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers. Because of the relationship between fuel and maize, prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil.</p>
<p>The price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.</p>

<p>Maize is widely used in Germany as a feedstock for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anaerobic_digesters" title="Anaerobic digesters">biogas plants</a>. Here the maize is harvested, shredded then placed in <a href="/wiki/Silage" title="Silage">silage</a> clamps from which it is fed into the biogas plants. This process makes use of the whole plant rather than simply using the kernels as in the production of fuel ethanol.</p>

(...) According to OXFAM UK, after NAFTA went into effect, the price of maize in Mexico fell 70% between 1994 and 2001. The number of farm jobs dropped as well: from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002. Many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers."). However, introduction in the northern latitudes of the US of <a class="external text" href="http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/news/stories/news4169.html" rel="nofollow">tropical maize for biofuels</a>, and not for human or animal consumption, may potentially alleviate this.</p>

<p>The breakdown of usage of the 12.1-billion-<a href="/wiki/Bushel" title="Bushel">bushel</a> (307-million-tonne) 2008 US maize crop was as follows, according to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report by the USDA.</p>

<p>In the US since 2009/2010, maize feedstock use for ethanol production has somewhat exceeded direct use for livestock feed; maize use for fuel ethanol was 5,130 million bushels (130 million tonnes) in the 2013/2014 marketing year.</p>
<p>A fraction of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for monogastric animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pellagra">Pellagra</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Pellagra" title="Pellagra">Pellagra</a></div>
<p>When maize was first introduced into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-American peoples, it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity. However, a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple food</a>. This was a mystery, since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous Americans, for whom maize was the principal staple food.</p>
<p>It was eventually discovered that the indigenous Americans had learned to soak maize in <a href="/wiki/Alkali" title="Alkali">alkali</a>-water—made with ashes and lime (<a href="/wiki/Calcium_oxide" title="Calcium oxide">calcium oxide</a>) since at least 1200–1500 BC by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesoamericans" title="Mesoamericans">Mesoamericans</a> and North Americans—which liberates the B-vitamin <a href="/wiki/Niacin" title="Niacin">niacin</a>, the lack of which was the underlying cause of the condition known as <a href="/wiki/Pellagra" title="Pellagra">pellagra</a>.</p>
<p>Maize was introduced into the diet of nonindigenous Americans without the necessary cultural knowledge acquired over thousands of years in the Americas. In the late 19th century, pellagra reached epidemic proportions in parts of the southern US, as medical researchers debated two theories for its origin: the deficiency theory (which was eventually shown to be true) said that pellagra was due to a deficiency of some nutrient, and the germ theory said that pellagra was caused by a germ transmitted by stable flies. A third theory, promoted by the eugenicist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Davenport" title="Charles Davenport">Charles Davenport</a>, held that people only contracted pellagra if they were susceptible to it due to certain "constitutional, inheritable" traits of the affected individual.</p>
<p>Once alkali processing and dietary variety were understood and applied, pellagra disappeared in the developed world. The development of high lysine maize and the promotion of a more balanced diet have also contributed to its demise. Pellagra still exists today in food-poor areas and refugee camps where people survive on donated maize.</p>

<p>Maize contains <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lipid_transfer_proteins" title="Lipid transfer proteins">lipid transfer protein</a>, an indigestible protein that survives cooking.

<p>In the United States, maize ears along with tobacco leaves are carved into the capitals of columns in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Capitol" title="United States Capitol">United States Capitol</a> building. Maize itself is sometimes used for temporary architectural detailing when the intent is to celebrate the fall season, local agricultural productivity and culture.
