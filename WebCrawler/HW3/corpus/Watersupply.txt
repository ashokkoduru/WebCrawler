<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Global_access_to_clean_water">Global access to clean water</span></h2>

<p>In 2010, about 85% of the global population (6.74 billion people) had access to piped water supply through house connections or to an <a href="/wiki/Improved_water_source" title="Improved water source">improved water source</a> through other means than house, including <a href="/wiki/Standpipe_(street)" title="Standpipe (street)">standpipes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_kiosk" title="Water kiosk">water kiosks</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spring_supplies" title="Spring supplies">spring supplies</a> and protected <a href="/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">wells</a>. However, about 14% (884 million people) did not have access to an improved water source and had to use unprotected wells or springs, canals, lakes or rivers for their water needs.</p>
<p>A clean water supply - in particular water that is not polluted with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Faeces" title="Faeces">fecal</a> matter from lack of <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> - is the single most important determinant of <a href="/wiki/Public_health" title="Public health">public health</a>. Destruction of water supply and/or sanitation infrastructure after major catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, war, etc.) poses the immediate threat of severe epidemics of <a href="/wiki/Waterborne_diseases" title="Waterborne diseases">waterborne diseases</a>, several of which can be life-threatening.</p>

<p>Water supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate treatment, including groundwater (<a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifers</a>), surface water (<a href="/wiki/Lake" title="Lake">lakes</a> and <a href="/wiki/River" title="River">rivers</a>), and the sea through <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">desalination</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">water treatment</a> steps include, in most cases, <a href="/wiki/Water_purification" title="Water purification">purification</a>, disinfection through <a href="/wiki/Water_chlorination" title="Water chlorination">chlorination</a> and sometimes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fluoridation" title="Fluoridation">fluoridation</a>. Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reservoir_(water)" title="Reservoir (water)">reservoirs</a>, which can be elevated such as <a href="/wiki/Water_tower" title="Water tower">water towers</a> or on the ground (for indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see <a href="/wiki/Non-revenue_water" title="Non-revenue water">non-revenue water</a>). Once water is used, <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> is typically discharged in a <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sewer</a> system and treated in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment_plant" title="Sewage treatment plant">sewage treatment plant</a> before being discharged into a river, lake or the sea or reused for <a href="/wiki/Landscaping" title="Landscaping">landscaping</a>, <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> or industrial use (see also <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Use">Use</span></h3>
<p>In the U.S, the typical single family home uses about 69.3 gallons (262 litres) of water per day (2008 estimate). This includes (in decreasing order) toilet use, washing machine use, showers, baths, <a href="/wiki/Tap_water" title="Tap water">tap</a> use, and leaks.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Service_quality">Service quality</span></h2>

<p>Many of the 3.5 billion people having access to piped water receive a poor or very poor quality of service, especially in developing countries where about 80% of the world population lives. Water supply <a href="/wiki/Service_quality" title="Service quality">service quality</a> has many dimensions: continuity; <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">water quality</a>; pressure; and the degree of responsiveness of service providers to customer complaints.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Continuity_of_supply">Continuity of supply</span></h3>
<p>Continuity of water supply is taken for granted in most developed countries, but is a severe problem in many developing countries, where sometimes water is only provided for a few hours every day or a few days a week. It is estimated that about half of the population of developing countries receives water on an intermittent basis.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_quality">Water quality</span></h3>
<p>Drinking <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">water quality</a> has a micro-biological and a physico-chemical dimension. There are thousands of parameters of water quality. In public water supply systems water should, at a minimum, be disinfected—most commonly through the use of <a href="/wiki/Water_chlorination" title="Water chlorination">chlorination</a> or the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ultra_violet" title="Ultra violet">ultra violet</a> light—or it may need to undergo treatment, especially in the case of <a href="/wiki/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a>. For more details, please see the separate entries on <a href="/wiki/Water_quality" title="Water quality">water quality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">water treatment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_pressure">Water pressure</span></h3>

<p>Water pressures vary in different locations of a distribution system. Water mains below the street may operate at higher pressures, with a <a href="/wiki/Pressure_regulator" title="Pressure regulator">pressure reducer</a> located at each point where the water enters a building or a house. In poorly managed systems, water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of water. Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a pressurised water tank serving an urban area, by pumping the water up into a <a href="/wiki/Water_tower" title="Water tower">water tower</a> and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the system or solely by pumps at the <a href="/wiki/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">water treatment</a> plant and repeater pumping stations.</p>
<p>Typical UK pressures are 4–5 <a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" title="Bar (unit)">bar</a> (60-70 <a href="/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" title="Pounds per square inch">PSI</a>) for an urban supply. However, some people can get over eight bars or below one bar. A single iron main pipe may cross a deep valley, it will have the same nominal pressure, however each consumer will get a bit more or less because of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hydrostatic_pressure" title="Hydrostatic pressure">hydrostatic pressure</a> (about 1 bar/10 m height). So people at the bottom of a 100-foot (30 m) hill will get about 3 bars more than those at the top.</p>
<p>The effective pressure also varies because of the pressure loss due to supply resistance even for the same static pressure. An urban consumer may have 5 metres of 15 mm pipe running from the iron main, so the kitchen tap flow will be fairly unrestricted, so high flow. A rural consumer may have a kilometre of rusted and <a href="/wiki/Limescale" title="Limescale">limed</a> 22 mm iron pipe, so their kitchen tap flow will be small.</p>
<p>For this reason, the UK domestic water system has traditionally (prior to 1989) employed a "cistern feed" system, where the incoming supply is connected to the kitchen sink and also a header/storage tank in the <a href="/wiki/Attic" title="Attic">attic</a>. Water can dribble into this tank through a 12 mm pipe, plus ball valve, and then supply the house on 22 or 28 mm pipes. Gravity water has a small pressure (say ¼ bar in the bathroom) so needs wide pipes allow higher flows. This is fine for baths and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers. A <a href="/wiki/Booster_pump" title="Booster pump">booster pump</a> or a <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Hydrophore_(system)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hydrophore (system) (page does not exist)">hydrophore</a> is installed to increase and maintain pressure. For this reason urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers (combies) which take a long time to fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Institutional_responsibility_and_governance">Institutional responsibility and governance</span></h2>
<p>A great variety of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Institutions" title="Institutions">institutions</a> have responsibilities in water supply. A basic distinction is between institutions responsible for policy and regulation on the one hand; and institutions in charge of providing services on the other hand.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Policy_and_regulation">Policy and regulation</span></h3>
<p>Water supply policies and regulation are usually defined by one or several Ministries, in consultation with the legislative branch. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_United_States" title="Water supply and sanitation in the United States">United States</a> the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, whose administrator reports directly to the President, is responsible for water and sanitation policy and standard setting within the executive branch. In other countries responsibility for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment (such as in <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Mexico" title="Water supply and sanitation in Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Colombia" title="Water supply and sanitation in Colombia">Colombia</a>), to a Ministry of Health (such as in <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Panama" title="Water supply and sanitation in Panama">Panama</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Honduras" title="Water supply and sanitation in Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Uruguay" title="Water supply and sanitation in Uruguay">Uruguay</a>), a Ministry of Public Works (such as in <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Ecuador" title="Water supply and sanitation in Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>), a Ministry of Economy (such as in German states) or a Ministry of Energy (such as in <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Iran" title="Water supply and sanitation in Iran">Iran</a>). A few countries, such as <a href="/wiki/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Bolivia" title="Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, even have a Ministry of Water. Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply. In the European Union, important policy functions have been entrusted to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supranational" title="Supranational">supranational</a> level. Policy and regulatory functions include the setting of tariff rules and the approval of tariff increases; setting, monitoring and enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection; <a href="/wiki/Benchmarking" title="Benchmarking">benchmarking</a> the performance of service providers; and reforms in the structure of institutions responsible for service provision. The distinction between policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clear-cut. In some countries they are both entrusted to Ministries, but in others regulatory functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulatory_agencies">Regulatory agencies</span></h4>
<p>Dozens of countries around the world have established regulatory agencies for infrastructure services, including often water supply and sanitation, in order to better protect consumers and to improve efficiency. Regulatory agencies can be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities, including in particular the approval of tariff increases and the management of sector information systems, including <a href="/wiki/Benchmarking" title="Benchmarking">benchmarking</a> systems. Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service providers. These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and objective in regulating service providers than departments of government Ministries. Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the executive branch of government, but in many countries have often not been able to exercise a great degree of autonomy. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_United_States" title="Water supply and sanitation in the United States">United States</a> regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost a century at the level of states, and in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> at the level of provinces. In both countries they cover several infrastructure sectors. In many US states they are called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_Utility_Commission" title="Public Utility Commission">Public Utility Commissions</a>. For England and Wales, a regulatory agency for water (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OFWAT" title="OFWAT">OFWAT</a>) was created as part of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. In many developing countries, water regulatory agencies were created during the 1990s in parallel with efforts at increasing private sector participation. (for more details on regulatory agencies in Latin America, for example, please see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_and_sanitation_in_Latin_America" title="Water and sanitation in Latin America">Water and sanitation in Latin America</a> and the regional association of water regulatory agencies ADERASA <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aderasa.org" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)</p>
<p>Many countries do not have regulatory agencies for water. In these countries service providers are regulated directly by local government, or the national government. This is, for example, the case in the countries of continental Europe, in China and India.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Service_provision">Service provision</span></h3>
<p>Water supply service providers, which are often <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utilities" title="Utilities">utilities</a>, differ from each other in terms of their geographical coverage relative to administrative boundaries; their sectoral coverage; their ownership structure; and their governance arrangements.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Geographical_coverage">Geographical coverage</span></h4>

<p>Many water utilities provide services in a single city, town or <a href="/wiki/Municipality" title="Municipality">municipality</a>. However, in many countries municipalities have associated in regional or inter-municipal or multi-jurisdictional utilities to benefit from <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a>. In the United States these can take the form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Special-purpose_district" title="Special-purpose district">special-purpose districts</a> which may have independent taxing authority. An example of a multi-jurisdictional water utility in the United States is <a href="/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Water_and_Sewer_Authority" title="District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority">WASA</a>, a utility serving <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Washington,_DC" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a> and various localities in the state of <a href="/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>. Multi-jurisdictional utilities are also common in Germany, where they are known as "Zweckverbaende", in France and in Italy.</p>
<p>In some federal countries, there are water service providers covering most or all cities and towns in an entire state, such as in all states of <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and some states in <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Mexico" title="Water supply and sanitation in Mexico">Water supply and sanitation in Mexico</a>). In <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a>, water supply and sewerage is supplied almost entirely through ten regional companies. Some smaller countries, especially developed countries, have established service providers that cover the entire country or at least most of its cities and major towns. Such national service providers are especially prevalent in West Africa and Central America, but also exist, for example, in <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> (see also <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Uruguay" title="Water supply and sanitation in Uruguay">water supply and sanitation in Uruguay</a>). In rural areas, where about half the world population lives, water services are often not provided by utilities, but by community-based organizations which usually cover one or sometimes several villages.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sector_coverage">Sector coverage</span></h4>
<p>Some water utilities provide only water supply services, while <a href="/wiki/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewerage</a> is under the responsibility of a different entity. This is for example the case in <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. However, in most cases water utilities also provide <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_sewer" title="Sanitary sewer">sewer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">sewage treatment</a> services. In some cities or countries utilities also distribute electricity. In a few cases such multi-utilities also collect solid waste and provide local telephone services. An example of such an integrated utility can be found in the Colombian city of <a href="/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn" title="Medellín">Medellín</a>. Utilities that provide water, sanitation and electricity can be found in <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> (Mainova), in <a href="/wiki/Casablanca" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Gabon" title="Gabon">Gabon</a> in West Africa. Multi-utilities provide certain benefits such as common billing and the option to cross-subsidize water services with revenues from electricity sales, if permitted by law.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ownership_and_governance_arrangements">Ownership and governance arrangements</span></h4>
<p>Water supply providers can be either public, private, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public-private_partnership" title="Public-private partnership">mixed</a> or cooperative. Most urban water supply services around the world are provided by public entities. As Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (2002) stated, "The water crisis that is affecting so many people is mainly a crisis of governance — not of <a href="/wiki/Water_scarcity" title="Water scarcity">water scarcity</a>." The introduction of cost-reflective tariffs together with <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Cross-subsidization&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Cross-subsidization (page does not exist)">cross-subsidization</a> between richer and poorer consumers is an essential governance reform in order to reduce the high levels of <a href="/wiki/Non-revenue_water" title="Non-revenue water">Unaccounted-for Water (UAW)</a> and to provide the finance needed to extend the network to those poorest households who remain unconnected. Partnership arrangements between the public and private sector can play an important role in order to achieve this objective.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Private_sector_participation">Private sector participation</span></h5>
<p>An estimated 10 percent of urban water supply is provided by private or mixed public-private companies, usually under <a href="/wiki/Concession_(contract)" title="Concession (contract)">concessions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lease" title="Lease">leases</a> or <a href="/wiki/Management_contract" title="Management contract">management contracts</a>. Under these arrangements the public entity that is legally responsible for service provision delegates certain or all aspects of service provision to the private service provider for a period typically ranging from 4 to 30 years. The public entity continues to own the assets. These arrangements are common in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Only in few parts of the world water supply systems have been completely sold to the private sector (<a href="/wiki/Privatization" title="Privatization">privatization</a>), such as in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> as well as in <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>. The largest private water companies in the world are <a href="/wiki/Suez_(company)" title="Suez (company)">Suez</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Veolia_Environnement" title="Veolia Environnement">Veolia Environnement</a> from France; <i>Aguas de Barcelona</i> from Spain; and <a href="/wiki/Thames_Water" title="Thames Water">Thames Water</a> from the UK, all of which are engaged internationally (see links to website of these companies below). In recent years, a number of cities have reverted to the public sector in a process called "remunicipalization".</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_water_service_provision">Public water service provision</span></h5>
<p>90% of urban water supply and sanitation services are currently in the public sector. They are owned by the state or local authorities, or also by collectives or cooperatives. They run without an aim for profit but are based on the ethos of providing a common good considered to be of public interest. In most middle and low-income countries, these publicly owned and managed water providers can be inefficient as a result of political interference, leading to over-staffing and low labor productivity. Ironically, the main losers from this institutional arrangement are the urban poor in these countries. Because they are not connected to the network, they end up paying far more per liter of water than do more well-off households connected to the network who benefit from the implicit subsidies that they receive from loss-making utilities. The fact that we are still so far from achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation shows that public water authorities, in their current state, are not working well enough. Yet some are being very successful and are modelling the best forms of public management. As <a href="/wiki/Ryutaro_Hashimoto" title="Ryutaro Hashimoto">Ryutaro Hashimoto</a>, former Japanese Prime Minister, notes: "Public water services currently provide more than 90 percent of water supply in the world. Modest improvement in public water operators will have immense impact on global provision of services."</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Governance_arrangements">Governance arrangements</span></h5>
<p>Governance arrangements for both public and private utilities can take many forms (Kurian and McCarney, 2010). Governance arrangements define the relationship between the service provider, its owners, its customers and regulatory entities. They determine the financial autonomy of the service provider and thus its ability to maintain its assets, expand services, attract and retain qualified staff, and ultimately to provide high-quality services. Key aspects of governance arrangements are the extent to which the entity in charge of providing services is insulated from arbitrary political intervention; and whether there is an explicit mandate and political will to allow the service provider to recover all or at least most of its costs through tariffs and retain these revenues. If water supply is the responsibility of a department that is integrated in the administration of a city, town or municipality, there is a risk that tariff revenues are diverted for other purposes. In some cases, there is also a risk that staff are appointed mainly on political grounds rather than based on their professional credentials.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Standardization">Standardization</span></h3>
<p>International standards for water supply system are covered by International Classification of Standards (ICS) 91.140.60.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparing_the_performance_of_water_and_sanitation_service_providers">Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers</span></h3>
<p>Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utilities" title="Utilities">utilities</a>) is needed, because the sector offers limited scope for direct competition (<a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a>). Firms operating in competitive markets are under constant pressure to out perform each other. Water utilities are often sheltered from this pressure, and it frequently shows: some utilities are on a sustained improvement track, but many others keep falling further behind best practice. <a href="/wiki/Benchmarking" title="Benchmarking">Benchmarking</a> the performance of utilities allows to simulate competition, establish realistic targets for improvement and create pressure to catch up with better utilities. Information on benchmarks for water and sanitation utilities is provided by the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Financial_aspects">Financial aspects</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Costs_and_financing">Costs and financing</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cost" title="Cost">cost</a> of supplying water consists, to a very large extent, of fixed costs (capital costs and personnel costs) and only to a small extent of variable costs that depend on the amount of water consumed (mainly energy and chemicals). The full cost of supplying water in urban areas in developed countries is about US$1–2 per cubic meter depending on local costs and local water consumption levels. The cost of sanitation (sewerage and wastewater treatment) is another US$1–2 per cubic meter. These costs are somewhat lower in developing countries. Throughout the world, only part of these costs is usually billed to consumers, the remainder being financed through direct or indirect <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subsidies" title="Subsidies">subsidies</a> from local, regional or national governments (see section on tariffs).</p>
<p>Besides subsidies water supply investments are financed through internally generated revenues as well as through debt. Debt financing can take the form of credits from commercial Banks, credits from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks (in the case of developing countries), and <a href="/wiki/Bond_(finance)" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a> (in the case of some developed countries and some upper middle-income countries).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tariffs">Tariffs</span></h3>
<p>Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of their costs. According to estimates by the World Bank the average (<a href="/wiki/Mean" title="Mean">mean</a>) global water tariff is US$0.53 per cubic meter. In developed countries the average tariff is US$1.04, while it is only U$0.11 in the poorest developing countries. The lowest tariffs in developing countries are found in South Asia (mean of US$0.09/m3), while the highest are found in Latin America (US$0.41/m3). Data for 132 cities were assessed. The tariff is estimate for a consumption level of 15 cubic meters per month. Few utilities do recover all their costs. According to the same World Bank study only 30% of utilities globally, and only 50% of utilities in developed countries, generate sufficient revenue to cover operation, maintenance and partial capital costs.</p>
<p>According to another study undertaken in 2006 by NUS Consulting, the average water and sewerage tariff in 14 mainly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> countries excluding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VAT" title="VAT">VAT</a> varied between US$0.66 per cubic meter in the United States and the equivalent of US$2.25 per cubic meter in Denmark. However, water consumption is much higher in the US than in Europe. Therefore, residential water bills may be very similar, even if the tariff per unit of consumption tends to be higher in Europe than in the US.</p>
<p>A typical family on the US East Coast paid between US$30 and US$70 per month for water and sewer services in 2005.</p>
<p>In developing countries, tariffs are usually much further from covering costs. Residential water bills for a typical consumption of 15 cubic meters per month vary between less than US$1 and US$12 per month.</p>
<p>Water and sanitation tariffs, which are almost always billed together, can take many different forms. Where meters are installed, tariffs are typically volumetric (per usage), sometimes combined with a small monthly fixed charge. In the absence of meters, flat or fixed rates — which are independent of actual consumption — are being charged. In developed countries, tariffs are usually the same for different categories of users and for different levels of consumption.</p>
<p>In developing countries, the situation is often characterized by cross-subsidies with the intent to make water more affordable for residential low-volume users that are assumed to be poor. For example, industrial and commercial users are often charged higher tariffs than public or residential users. Also, metered users are often charged higher tariffs for higher levels of consumption (increasing-block tariffs). However, cross-subsidies between residential users do not always reach their objective. Given the overall low level of water tariffs in developing countries even at higher levels of consumption, most consumption subsidies benefit the wealthier segments of society. Also, high industrial and commercial tariffs can provide an incentive for these users to supply water from other sources than the utility (own wells, water tankers) and thus actually erode the utility's revenue base.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Metering">Metering</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Water_metering" title="Water metering">Water metering</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_meter" title="Water meter">Water meter</a></div>

<p>Metering of water supply is usually motivated by one or several of four objectives: First, it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects water resources (environmental objective). Second, it can postpone costly system expansion and saves energy and chemical costs (economic objective). Third, it allows a utility to better locate distribution losses (technical objective). Fourth, it allows to charge for water based on use, which is perceived by many as the fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply to users. Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is widespread in developed countries, except for the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. In developing countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are metered and the tendency is increasing.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_meters" title="Water meters">Water meters</a> are read by one of several methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>the water customer writes down the meter reading and mails in a postcard with this info to the water department;</li>
<li>the water customer writes down the meter reading and uses a phone dial-in system to transfer this info to the water department;</li>
<li>the water customer logs into the <a href="/wiki/Website" title="Website">website</a> of the water supply company, enters the address, meter ID and meter readings <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.waterbedrijfgroningen.nl/wag/Wbgr-internet.nsf/frameset?openFrameset&amp;submenu=Algemene%20Informatie%20meterstanden" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
<li>a meter reader comes to the premise and enters the meter reading into a handheld computer;</li>
<li>the meter reading is echoed on a display unit mounted to the outside of the premise, where a meter reader records them;</li>
<li>a small radio is hooked up to the meter to automatically transmit readings to corresponding receivers in handheld computers, utility vehicles or distributed collectors</li>
<li>a small computer is hooked up to the meter that can either dial out or receive automated phone calls that give the reading to a central computer system.</li>

<p>Throughout history, people have devised systems to make getting and using water more convenient. Early <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_empire" title="Roman empire">Rome</a> had indoor plumbing, meaning a system of <a href="/wiki/Roman_aqueduct" title="Roman aqueduct">aqueducts</a> and pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use.</p>
<p>Until the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enlightenment_era" title="Enlightenment era">Enlightenment era</a>, little progress was made in water supply and sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected throughout Europe. It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in <a href="/wiki/London_water_supply_infrastructure" title="London water supply infrastructure">London</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Waterworks_Company" title="Chelsea Waterworks Company">Chelsea Waterworks Company</a> was established in 1723 "for the better supplying the <a href="/wiki/City_of_Westminster" title="City of Westminster">City</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liberty_of_Westminster" title="Liberty of Westminster">Liberties</a> of <a href="/wiki/Westminster" title="Westminster">Westminster</a> and parts adjacent with water". Other waterworks were established in London, including at <a href="/wiki/West_Ham" title="West Ham">West Ham</a> in 1743, at <a href="/wiki/Lea_Bridge" title="Lea Bridge">Lea Bridge</a> before 1767, <a href="/wiki/Lambeth_Waterworks_Company" title="Lambeth Waterworks Company">Lambeth Waterworks Company</a> in 1785, <a href="/wiki/West_Middlesex_Waterworks_Company" title="West Middlesex Waterworks Company">West Middlesex Waterworks Company</a> in 1806 and <a href="/wiki/Grand_Junction_Waterworks_Company" title="Grand Junction Waterworks Company">Grand Junction Waterworks Company</a> in 1811.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Trap_(plumbing)" title="Trap (plumbing)">S-bend</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pipe_(material)" title="Pipe (material)">pipe</a> was invented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alexander_Cummings" title="Alexander Cummings">Alexander Cummings</a> in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Crapper" title="Thomas Crapper">Thomas Crapper</a> in 1880.

<p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ancient_Peru" title="Ancient Peru">ancient Peru</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Nazca_culture" title="Nazca culture">Nazca people</a> employed a system of interconnected wells and an underground watercourse known as <a href="/wiki/Puquios" title="Puquios">puquios</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="Spanish colonization of the Americas">Spanish America</a>, a community operated watercourse known as an <a href="/wiki/Acequia" title="Acequia">acequia</a>, combined with a simple sand filtration system, provided <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Potable" title="Potable">potable</a> water.

<p><a href="/wiki/Water_tower" title="Water tower">Water towers</a> appeared around the late 19th century, as building height rose, and steam, electric and diesel-powered <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_pump" title="Water pump">water pumps</a> became available.

<p>The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed in 1910 by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Major" title="Major">Major</a> (later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brigadier_General" title="Brigadier General">Brig.

Lyster</a> (1869–1947) of the <a href="/wiki/Army_Medical_Department_(United_States)" title="Army Medical Department (United States)">Army Medical Department</a> used a solution of <a href="/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite" title="Calcium hypochlorite">calcium hypochlorite</a> in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Lyster_Bag&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Lyster Bag (page does not exist)">Lyster Bag</a> (also spelled Lister Bag). Darnall's work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water '<i><b>purification'</b></i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">Desalination</a> appeared during the late 20th century, and is still limited to a few areas.</p>
<p>During the beginning of the 21st Century, especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure have not been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand. Among several options that have been managed are the extensive use of desalination technology, this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in "dry" countries like <a href="/wiki/List_of_desalination_plants_in_Australia" title="List of desalination plants in Australia">Australia</a>. Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including <a href="/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting" title="Rainwater harvesting">Rainwater harvesting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stormwater_harvesting" title="Stormwater harvesting">Stormwater harvesting</a> where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as "Fit for Purpose".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_treatment">Water treatment</span></h3>

<p>The first documented use of <a href="/wiki/Sand_filter" title="Sand filter">sand filters</a> to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paisley,_Scotland" title="Paisley, Scotland">Paisley, Scotland</a>, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. The first treated public water supply in the world was installed by engineer <a href="/wiki/James_Simpson_(engineer)" title="James Simpson (engineer)">James Simpson</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Waterworks_Company" title="Chelsea Waterworks Company">Chelsea Waterworks Company</a> in London in 1829. The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_Snow_(physician)" title="John Snow (physician)">John Snow</a> during the <a href="/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak" title="1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak">1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak</a> demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_Water_Act_1852" title="Metropolis Water Act 1852">Metropolis Water Act</a> introduced regulation of the water supply companies in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty <a href="/wiki/Slow_sand_filter" title="Slow sand filter">slow sand filter</a> and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in <a href="/wiki/Lincoln,_England" title="Lincoln, England">Lincoln, England</a>. Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The first continuous use of chlorine in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the <a href="/wiki/Rockaway_River" title="Rockaway River">Rockaway River</a>), which served as the supply for <a href="/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey" title="Jersey City, New Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a>. <a href="/wiki/Desalination" title="Desalination">Desalination</a> appeared during the late 20th century, and is still limited to a few areas.</p>
<p>The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Medical_Service" title="Indian Medical Service">Indian Medical Service</a>, Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Major" title="Major">Major</a> <a href="/wiki/Carl_Rogers_Darnall" title="Carl Rogers Darnall">Carl Rogers Darnall</a>, Professor of Chemistry at the <a href="/wiki/Army_Medical_School" title="Army Medical School">Army Medical School</a>, gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910.
