<p><b>William Henry</b> "<b>Bill</b>" <b>Gates III</b> (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist. In 1975, Gates and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Allen" title="Paul Allen">Paul Allen</a> co-founded <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, which became the world's largest <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">PC</a> software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and <a href="/wiki/Software_architect" title="Software architect">chief software architect</a>, and was the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. Gates has authored and co-authored several books.</p>
<p>Starting in 1987, Gates was included in the <a href="/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires" title="The World's Billionaires"><i>Forbes</i> list of the world's wealthiest people</a> and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 2007, again in 2009, and has been since 2014. Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$</span>40 billion to more than <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$</span>82 billion. Between 2013 and 2014, his wealth increased by <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$</span>15 billion. Gates is currently the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$81.7 billion as of October 2016.</p>
<p>Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_computer_revolution" title="Personal computer revolution">personal computer revolution</a>. Gates has been <a href="/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft" title="Criticism of Microsoft">criticized for his business tactics</a>, which have been considered <a href="/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices" title="Anti-competitive practices">anti-competitive</a>, an opinion that has in some cases been upheld by numerous court rulings. Later in his career Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the <a href="/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, established in 2000.</p>
<p>Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to <a href="/wiki/Ray_Ozzie" title="Ray Ozzie">Ray Ozzie</a> (chief software architect) and <a href="/wiki/Craig_Mundie" title="Craig Mundie">Craig Mundie</a> (chief research and strategy officer). Ozzie later left the company. Gates' last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft, in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO <a href="/wiki/Satya_Nadella" title="Satya Nadella">Satya Nadella</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Gates was born in <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/William_H._Gates,_Sr." title="William H. Gates, Sr.">William H. Gates, Sr.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Maxwell_Gates" title="Mary Maxwell Gates">Mary Maxwell Gates</a>. Gates' ancestral origin includes <a href="/wiki/English_people" title="English people">English</a>, German, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irish_American" title="Irish American">Irish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people" title="Ulster Scots people">Scots-Irish</a>. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for <a href="/wiki/First_Interstate_BancSystem" title="First Interstate BancSystem">First Interstate BancSystem</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Way_of_America" title="United Way of America">United Way</a>. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a <a href="/wiki/National_bank#United_States" title="National bank">national bank</a> president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix. Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him. When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the <a href="/wiki/Congregational_Christian_Churches" title="Congregational Christian Churches">Congregational Christian Churches</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reformed" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> denomination. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was <a href="/wiki/Hearts" title="Hearts">hearts</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pickleball" title="Pickleball">pickleball</a> or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".</p>
<p>At 13, he enrolled in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lakeside_School_(Seattle,_Washington)" title="Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)">Lakeside School</a>, a private preparatory school. When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rummage_sale" title="Rummage sale">rummage sale</a> to buy a <a href="/wiki/Teletype_Model_33" title="Teletype Model 33">Teletype Model 33</a> ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> (GE) computer for the school's students. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BASIC_programming_language" title="BASIC programming language">BASIC</a>, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of <a href="/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" title="Tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a> that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine." After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including <a href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">DEC</a> <a href="/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor" title="Programmed Data Processor">PDP</a> minicomputers. One of these systems was a <a href="/wiki/PDP-10" title="PDP-10">PDP-10</a> belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Allen" title="Paul Allen">Paul Allen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ric_Weiland" title="Ric Weiland">Ric Weiland</a>, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.</p>
<p>At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied <a href="/wiki/Source_code" title="Source code">source code</a> for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in <a href="/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language)">Lisp</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Machine_language" title="Machine language">machine language</a>. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cobol" title="Cobol">Cobol</a>, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls." He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success." At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called <a href="/wiki/Traf-O-Data" title="Traf-O-Data">Traf-O-Data</a>, to make <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Traffic_counter" title="Traffic counter">traffic counters</a> based on the <a href="/wiki/Intel_8008" title="Intel 8008">Intel 8008</a> processor. In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973, and was a <a href="/wiki/National_Merit_Scholarship_Program" title="National Merit Scholarship Program">National Merit Scholar</a>. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the <a href="/wiki/SAT" title="SAT">SAT</a> and enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> in the autumn of 1973, chose pre-law major but took most rigorous mathematics and graduate level computer science courses. While at Harvard, he met <a href="/wiki/Steve_Ballmer" title="Steve Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a>, who would later succeed Gates as CEO of Microsoft.</p>

<p>In his second year, Gates devised an <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> for <a href="/wiki/Pancake_sorting" title="Pancake sorting">pancake sorting</a> as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a <a href="/wiki/Combinatorics" title="Combinatorics">combinatorics</a> class by <a href="/wiki/Harry_R._Lewis" title="Harry R. Lewis">Harry Lewis</a>, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years; its successor is faster by only one percent. His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist <a href="/wiki/Christos_Papadimitriou" title="Christos Papadimitriou">Christos Papadimitriou</a>.</p>
<p>Gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at <a href="/wiki/Honeywell" title="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> during the summer of 1974. The following year saw the release of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MITS_Altair_8800" title="MITS Altair 8800">MITS Altair 8800</a> based on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intel_8080_CPU" title="Intel 8080 CPU">Intel 8080 CPU</a>, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company. Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start a company.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="BASIC">BASIC</span></h3>

<p>After reading the January 1975 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Popular_Electronics" title="Popular Electronics">Popular Electronics</a></i> that demonstrated the <a href="/wiki/Altair_8800" title="Altair 8800">Altair 8800</a>, Gates contacted <a href="/wiki/Micro_Instrumentation_and_Telemetry_Systems" title="Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems">Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems</a> (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a <a href="/wiki/BASIC" title="BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ed_Roberts_(computers)" title="Ed Roberts (computers)">Ed Roberts</a> agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair <a href="/wiki/Emulator" title="Emulator">emulator</a> that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in <a href="/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque</a>, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as <a href="/wiki/Altair_BASIC" title="Altair BASIC">Altair BASIC</a>. Paul Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque. Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">State of New Mexico</a>. Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an <a href="/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists" title="Open Letter to Hobbyists">Open Letter to Hobbyists</a> in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software. This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in <a href="/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington" title="Bellevue, Washington">Bellevue</a>, Washington, on January 1, 1979.</p>
<p>During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="IBM_partnership">IBM partnership</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> approached Microsoft in July 1980, regarding its upcoming personal computer, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IBM_PC" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a>. The computer company first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to <a href="/wiki/Digital_Research" title="Digital Research">Digital Research</a> (DRI), makers of the widely used <a href="/wiki/CP/M" title="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system. IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using <a href="/wiki/86-DOS" title="86-DOS">86-DOS</a> (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that <a href="/wiki/Tim_Paterson" title="Tim Paterson">Tim Paterson</a> of <a href="/wiki/Seattle_Computer_Products" title="Seattle Computer Products">Seattle Computer Products</a> (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PC_DOS" title="PC DOS">PC DOS</a> in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.</p>
<p>Gates did not offer to transfer the <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system. They did, and the sales of <a href="/wiki/MS-DOS" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> made Microsoft a major player in the industry. Despite IBM's name on the operating system the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. <i>PC Magazine</i> asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?", and <i><a href="/wiki/InfoWorld" title="InfoWorld">InfoWorld</a></i> quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer". Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Windows">Windows</span></h3>
<p>Microsoft launched its first retail version of <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> to develop a separate operating system called <a href="/wiki/OS/2" title="OS/2">OS/2</a>. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Management_style">Management style</span></h3>

<p>From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it. He gained a reputation for being distant to others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls." Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."</p>
<p>As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. He interrupted presentations with such comments "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" and "Why don't you just give up your <a href="/wiki/Employee_stock_option" title="Employee stock option">options</a> and join the <a href="/wiki/Peace_Corps" title="Peace Corps">Peace Corps</a>?" The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced. When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."</p>
<p>Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's <a href="/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming language</a> products, but his role most of its history was primarily as management and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the <a href="/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100" title="TRS-80 Model 100">TRS-80 Model 100</a>, but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle" title="Jerry Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a> wrote in 1985 that when watching Gates announcing <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Excel" title="Microsoft Excel">Microsoft Excel</a>, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hack_(programmer_subculture)" title="Hack (programmer subculture)">hack</a>." On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing <a href="/wiki/Ray_Ozzie" title="Ray Ozzie">Ray Ozzie</a> in charge of day-to-day management and <a href="/wiki/Craig_Mundie" title="Craig Mundie">Craig Mundie</a> in charge of long-term product strategy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Antitrust_litigation">Antitrust litigation</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Microsoft_antitrust_case" title="United States Microsoft antitrust case">United States Microsoft antitrust case</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/European_Union_Microsoft_competition_case" title="European Union Microsoft competition case">European Union Microsoft competition case</a></div>

<p>Many decisions that led to <a href="/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law" title="United States antitrust law">antitrust</a> litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft" title="United States v. Microsoft">United States v. Microsoft</a></i> case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner <a href="/wiki/David_Boies" title="David Boies">David Boies</a> over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition. <i>BusinessWeek</i> reported:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree." Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed <a href="/wiki/Monopolization" title="Monopolization">monopolization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tying_(commerce)" title="Tying (commerce)">tying</a>, and blocking competition, both in violation of the <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance_in_ads">Appearance in ads</span></h3>

<p>Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft in 2008. The first commercial, co-starring <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mugshot" title="Mugshot">mugshot</a> of his arrest in <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (<i><a href="/wiki/Seinfeld" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-Microsoft">Post-Microsoft</span></h2>
<p>Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates continues his philanthropy and works on other projects.</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his fortune increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp. On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside <a href="/wiki/Satya_Nadella" title="Satya Nadella">Satya Nadella</a>.</p>
<p>In a substantial interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine, published in March 27, 2014 issue, Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues, such as climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been." Gate's days are planned for him, similar to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_President" title="US President">US President</a>'s schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>

<p>After being named one of <i><a href="/wiki/Good_Housekeeping" title="Good Housekeeping">Good Housekeeping</a></i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s "50 Most Eligible Bachelors" in 1985, Gates married <a href="/wiki/Melinda_Gates" title="Melinda Gates">Melinda French</a> in Hawaii on January 1, 1994. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (born 1996), Rory John (born 1999), and Phoebe Adele (born 2002). The family resides in <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gates%27_house" title="Bill Gates' house">the Gates' home</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Earth_sheltering" title="Earth sheltering">earth-sheltered house</a> in the side of a hill overlooking <a href="/wiki/Lake_Washington" title="Lake Washington">Lake Washington</a> in Medina near <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> in the state of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)">Washington</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States</a>. According to 2007 <a href="/wiki/King_County,_Washington" title="King County, Washington">King County</a> public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property tax is $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m) dining room.</p>
<p>In an interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i>, Gates stated in regard to his faith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."</p>
<p>Among Gates' private acquisitions is the <a href="/wiki/Codex_Leicester" title="Codex Leicester">Codex Leicester</a>, a collection of writings by <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, which Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994. Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></i>. He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.</p>
<p>Gates was number one on the <a href="/wiki/Forbes_400" title="Forbes 400">Forbes 400</a> list from 1993 through to 2007, and number one on <i>Forbes</i> list of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lists_of_billionaires" title="Lists of billionaires">The World's Richest People</a> from 1995 to 2007 and 2009. In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, causing the media to call Gates a "centibillionaire". Despite his wealth and extensive business travel Gates usually flew <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coach_class" title="Coach class">coach</a> until 1997, when he bought a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the <a href="/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" title="Dot-com bubble">dot-com bubble</a> burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Slim" title="Carlos Slim">Carlos Slim</a>, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates).</p>
<p>Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667. He founded <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corbis" title="Corbis">Corbis</a>, a digital imaging company, in 1989.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a></div>
<p>Gates studied the work of <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller" title="John D. Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable <a href="/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the <a href="/wiki/Wellcome_Trust" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a>.</p>
<p>The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy &amp; Advocacy Division.</p>
<p>Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of <a href="/wiki/David_Rockefeller" title="David Rockefeller">David Rockefeller</a> as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_family" title="Rockefeller family">Rockefeller family</a>'s philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.</p>
<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism" title="Genetically modified organism">genetically modified organisms</a> in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the <a href="/wiki/International_Rice_Research_Institute" title="International Rice Research Institute">International Rice Research Institute</a> in developing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Golden_Rice" title="Golden Rice">Golden Rice</a>, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_A_deficiency" title="Vitamin A deficiency">Vitamin A deficiency</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal">Personal</span></h4>
<p>Gates' wife suggested people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Power_of_Half" title="The Power of Half">The Power of Half</a></i>. Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor <a href="/wiki/Warren_Buffett" title="Warren Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>, and Facebook founder and CEO <a href="/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" title="Mark Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Giving_Pledge" title="Giving Pledge">Giving Pledge</a>." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.</p>
<p>Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of <a href="/wiki/Superintelligence" title="Superintelligence">superintelligence</a>; in a <a href="/wiki/Reddit" title="Reddit">Reddit</a> "ask me anything", he stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with <a href="/wiki/Elon_Musk" title="Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a> and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a March 2015 interview, with <a href="/wiki/Baidu" title="Baidu">Baidu</a>'s CEO, <a href="/wiki/Robin_Li" title="Robin Li">Robin Li</a>, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" <a href="/wiki/Nick_Bostrom" title="Nick Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a>'s recent work, <i><a href="/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies" title="Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies">Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</a></i>.</p>
<p>Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect Frank O. Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.</p>
<p>The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harvard_John_A._Paulson_School_of_Engineering_and_Applied_Sciences" title="Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences">Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction. Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.</p>
<p>On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself dumping a bucket of ice water on his head, after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so, in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (<a href="/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis" title="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>).</p>
<p>Bill Gates and his foundation are taking an interest in solving global <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> problems since about 2005, for example by announcing the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" which has received considerable media interest. To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Bill Gates drank water which was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a <a href="/wiki/Sewage_sludge_treatment" title="Sewage sludge treatment">sewage sludge treatment</a> process called the <a href="/wiki/Omni_Processor" title="Omni Processor">Omni-processor</a>. In early 2015, he also appeared with <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon" title="Jimmy Fallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tonight_Show" title="The Tonight Show">The Tonight Show</a></i> and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this <a href="/wiki/Reclaimed_water" title="Reclaimed water">reclaimed water</a> or bottled water.</p>
<p>Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h4>
<p>In 2007, the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies which have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world. In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility. It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices. The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_W._Lefever" title="Ernest W. Lefever">Ernest W. Lefever</a> for its exclusion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-Hispanic_Whites" title="Non-Hispanic Whites">Caucasian</a> students. The scholarship program is administered by the <a href="/wiki/United_Negro_College_Fund" title="United Negro College Fund">United Negro College Fund</a>.
