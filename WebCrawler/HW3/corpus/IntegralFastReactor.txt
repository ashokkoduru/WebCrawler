<p>The <b>integral fast reactor</b> (<b>IFR</b>, originally <b>advanced <a href="/wiki/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor" title="Liquid metal cooled reactor">liquid-metal reactor</a></b>) is a design for a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a> using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_neutron" title="Fast neutron">fast neutrons</a> and no <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">neutron moderator</a> (a <a href="/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor" title="Fast-neutron reactor">"fast" reactor</a>).

<p>IFR development began in 1984 and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Energy" title="U.S. Department of Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a> built a prototype, the <a href="/wiki/Experimental_Breeder_Reactor_II" title="Experimental Breeder Reactor II">Experimental Breeder Reactor II</a>. On April 3, 1986, two tests demonstrated the inherent safety of the IFR concept. These tests simulated accidents involving loss of coolant flow. Even with its normal shutdown devices disabled, the reactor shut itself down safely without overheating anywhere in the system. The IFR project was canceled by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">US Congress</a> in 1994, three years before completion.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The IFR is cooled by liquid <a href="/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a> and fueled by an <a href="/wiki/Alloy" title="Alloy">alloy</a> of <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>. The fuel is contained in steel cladding with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liquid_sodium" title="Liquid sodium">liquid sodium</a> filling in the space between the fuel and the cladding. A void above the fuel allows <a href="/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> and radioactive <a href="/wiki/Xenon" title="Xenon">xenon</a> to be collected safely without significantly increasing pressure inside the fuel element, and also allows the fuel to expand without breaching the cladding, making metal rather than oxide fuel practical.</p>
<p>The advantage of lead as opposed to sodium is that it is not reactive chemically, especially with water or air. The disadvantages are that liquid lead is far more viscous than liquid sodium (increasing pumping costs), and there are numerous radioactive neutron activation products, while there are essentially none from sodium.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_design_decisions">Basic design decisions</span></h3>


<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metallic_fuel">Metallic fuel</span></h4>
<p>Metal fuel with a sodium-filled void inside the cladding to allow fuel expansion has been demonstrated in EBR-II. Metallic fuel makes pyroprocessing the reprocessing technology of choice.</p>
<p>Fabrication of metallic fuel is easier and cheaper than ceramic (oxide) fuel, especially under remote handling conditions.</p>
<p>Metallic fuel has better heat conductivity and lower heat capacity than oxide, which has safety advantages.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sodium_coolant">Sodium coolant</span></h4>
<p>Use of liquid metal coolant removes the need for a pressure vessel around the reactor. Sodium has excellent nuclear characteristics, a high heat capacity and heat transfer capacity, low viscosity, a reasonably low melting point and a high boiling point, and excellent compatibility with other materials including structural materials and fuel. The high heat capacity of the coolant and the elimination of water from the core increase the inherent safety of the core.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pool_design_rather_than_loop">Pool design rather than loop</span></h4>
<p>Containing all of the primary coolant in a pool produces several safety and reliability advantages.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Onsite_reprocessing_using_pyroprocessing">Onsite reprocessing using pyroprocessing</span></h4>
<p>Reprocessing is essential to achieve most of the benefits of a fast reactor, improving fuel usage and reducing radioactive waste each by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Onsite processing is what makes the IFR <i>integral</i>. This and the use of pyroprocessing both reduce proliferation risk.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pyroprocessing" title="Pyroprocessing">Pyroprocessing</a> (using an electrorefiner) has been demonstrated at EBR-II as practical on the scale required. Compared to the <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a> aqueous process, it is economical in capital cost, and is unsuitable for production of weapons material, again unlike PUREX which was developed for weapons programs.</p>
<p>Pyroprocessing makes metallic fuel the fuel of choice. The two decisions are complementary.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h4>
<p>The four basic decisions of metallic fuel, sodium coolant, pool design, and onsite reprocessing by electrorefining, are complementary, and produce a fuel cycle that is proliferation resistant and efficient in fuel usage, and a reactor with a high level of inherent safety, while minimizing the production of high-level waste. The practicality of these decisions has been demonstrated over many years of operation of EBR-II.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Advantages">Advantages</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Breeder_reactor" title="Breeder reactor">Breeder reactors</a> (such as the IFR) could in principle extract almost all of the energy contained in <a href="/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, decreasing fuel requirements by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to traditional once-through reactors, which extract less than 0.65% of the energy in mined uranium, and less than 5% of the enriched uranium with which they are fueled. This could greatly dampen concern about fuel supply or energy used in <a href="/wiki/Uranium_mining" title="Uranium mining">mining</a>. In fact, seawater uranium extraction could provide enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy our energy needs indefinitely, thus making <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power_proposed_as_renewable_energy" title="Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy">nuclear energy</a> as sustainable as solar or wind <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>.</li>
<li>Fast reactors can "burn" long lasting nuclear <a href="/wiki/Transuranic_waste" title="Transuranic waste">transuranic waste</a> (TRU) waste components (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Actinides" title="Actinides">actinides</a>: <a href="/wiki/Reactor-grade_plutonium" title="Reactor-grade plutonium">reactor-grade plutonium</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minor_actinides" title="Minor actinides">minor actinides</a>), turning liabilities into assets. Another major waste component, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a> (FP), would stabilize at a lower level of radioactivity than the original natural uranium ore it was attained from in two to four centuries, rather than tens of thousands of years. The fact that <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">4th generation reactors</a> are being designed to use the waste from <a href="/wiki/Generation_III_reactor" title="Generation III reactor">3rd generation plants</a> could change the nuclear story fundamentallyâ€”potentially making the combination of 3rd and 4th generation plants a more attractive energy option than 3rd generation by itself would have been, both from the perspective of waste management and energy security.</li>
<li>The use of a medium-scale <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing" title="Nuclear reprocessing">reprocessing</a> facility onsite, and the use of <a href="/wiki/Pyroprocessing" title="Pyroprocessing">pyroprocessing</a> rather than aqueous reprocessing, is claimed to considerably reduce the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">proliferation</a> potential of possible diversion of fissile material as the processing facility is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/In-situ" title="In-situ">in-situ</a>/integral.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Safety">Safety</span></h2>
<p>In traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactors</a> (LWRs) the core must be maintained at a high pressure to keep the water liquid at high temperatures. In contrast, since the IFR is a <a href="/wiki/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor" title="Liquid metal cooled reactor">liquid metal cooled reactor</a>, the core could operate at close to ambient pressure, dramatically reducing the danger of a <a href="/wiki/Loss-of-coolant_accident" title="Loss-of-coolant accident">loss-of-coolant accident</a>. The entire reactor core, <a href="/wiki/Heat_exchanger" title="Heat exchanger">heat exchangers</a> and primary cooling pumps are immersed in a pool of liquid sodium or lead, making a loss of primary coolant extremely unlikely. The coolant loops are designed to allow for cooling through natural <a href="/wiki/Convection" title="Convection">convection</a>, meaning that in the case of a power loss or unexpected reactor shutdown, the heat from the reactor core would be sufficient to keep the coolant circulating even if the primary cooling pumps were to fail.</p>
<p>The IFR also has <a href="/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety" title="Passive nuclear safety">passive safety</a> advantages as compared with conventional LWRs. The fuel and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cladding_(nuclear_fuel)" title="Cladding (nuclear fuel)">cladding</a> are designed such that when they expand due to increased temperatures, more neutrons would be able to escape the core, thus reducing the rate of the fission chain reaction. In other words, an increase in the core temperature will act as a feedback mechanism that decreases the core power. This attribute is known as a negative <a href="/wiki/Temperature_coefficient#Temperature_coefficient_of_reactivity" title="Temperature coefficient">temperature coefficient of reactivity</a>. Most LWRs also have negative reactivity coefficients; however, in an IFR, this effect is strong enough to stop the reactor from reaching core damage without external action from operators or safety systems. This was demonstrated in a series of safety tests on the prototype. Pete Planchon, the engineer who conducted the tests for an international audience quipped "Back in 1986, we actually gave a small [20 MWe] prototype advanced fast reactor a couple of chances to melt down. It politely refused both times."</p>
<p>Liquid sodium presents safety problems because it ignites spontaneously on contact with air and can cause explosions on contact with water. This was the case at the <a href="/wiki/Monju_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="Monju Nuclear Power Plant">Monju Nuclear Power Plant</a> in a 1995 accident and fire. To reduce the risk of explosions following a leak of water from the steam turbines, the IFR design (as with other <a href="/wiki/Sodium-cooled_fast_reactor" title="Sodium-cooled fast reactor">sodium-cooled fast reactors</a>) includes an intermediate liquid-metal coolant loop between the reactor and the steam turbines. The purpose of this loop is to ensure that any explosion following accidental mixing of sodium and turbine water would be limited to the secondary heat exchanger and not pose a risk to the reactor itself. Alternative designs use lead instead of sodium as the primary coolant. The disadvantages of lead are its higher density and viscosity, which increases pumping costs, and radioactive activation products resulting from neutron absorption. A lead-bismuth eutectate, as used in some Russian submarine reactors, has lower viscosity and density, but the same activation product problems can occur.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Efficiency_and_fuel_cycle">Efficiency and fuel cycle</span></h2>

<p>The goals of the IFR project were to increase the efficiency of uranium usage by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_breeder" title="Fast breeder">breeding</a> plutonium and eliminating the need for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transuranic" title="Transuranic">transuranic</a> isotopes ever to leave the site. The reactor was an unmoderated design running on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_neutron" title="Fast neutron">fast neutrons</a>, designed to allow any transuranic isotope to be consumed (and in some cases used as fuel).</p>
<p>Compared to current light-water reactors with a once-through fuel cycle that induces fission (and derives energy) from less than 1% of the uranium found in nature, a breeder reactor like the IFR has a very efficient (99.5% of uranium undergoes fission) fuel cycle. The basic scheme used pyroelectric separation, a common method in other metallurgical processes, to remove transuranics and actinides from the wastes and concentrate them. These concentrated fuels were then reformed, on site, into new fuel elements.</p>
<p>The available fuel metals were never separated from the <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_plutonium" title="Isotopes of plutonium">plutonium isotopes</a> nor from all the fission products, and therefore relatively difficult to use in nuclear weapons. Also, plutonium never had to leave the site, and thus was far less open to unauthorized diversion.</p>
<p>Another important benefit of removing the long <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a> transuranics from the waste cycle is that the remaining waste becomes a much shorter-term hazard. After the <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinides</a> (<a href="/wiki/Reprocessed_uranium" title="Reprocessed uranium">reprocessed uranium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minor_actinides" title="Minor actinides">minor actinides</a>) are recycled, the remaining <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_waste" title="Radioactive waste">radioactive waste</a> isotopes are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Half-life" title="Half-life">half-life</a> of 90Â years (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sm-151" title="Sm-151">Sm-151</a>) or less or 211,100 years (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tc-99" title="Tc-99">Tc-99</a>) and more; plus any <a href="/wiki/Activation_product" title="Activation product">activation products</a> from the non-fuel reactor components.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparisons_to_light-water_reactors">Comparisons to light-water reactors</span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nuclear_waste">Nuclear waste</span></h3>
<p>IFR-style reactors produce much less waste than LWR-style reactors, and can even utilize other waste as fuel.</p>
<p>The primary argument for pursuing IFR-style technology today is that it provides the best solution to the existing nuclear waste problem because fast reactors can be fueled from the waste products of existing reactors as well as from the plutonium used in weapons, as is the case in the operating, as of 2014, <a href="/wiki/BN-800_reactor" title="BN-800 reactor">BN-800 reactor</a>. <a href="/wiki/Depleted_uranium" title="Depleted uranium">Depleted uranium</a> (DU) waste can also be used as fuel in fast reactors.</p>
<p>The waste products of IFR reactors either have a short half-life, which means that they decay quickly and become relatively safe, or a long halflife, which means that they are only slightly radioactive. Due to pyroprocessing the total volume of true waste/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a> is 1/20th the volume of spent fuel produced by a light water plant of the same power output, and is often all considered to be waste. 70% of fission products are either stable or have half lives under one year. Technetium-99 and iodine-129, which constitute 6% of fission products, have very long half lives but can be <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">transmuted</a> to isotopes with very short half lives (15.46 seconds and 12.36 hours) by neutron absorption within a reactor, effectively destroying them(see more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Long-lived_fission_products" title="Long-lived fission products">Long-lived fission products</a>). Zirconium-93, another 5% of fission products, could in principle be recycled into fuel-pin cladding, where it does not matter that it is radioactive. Excluding the contribution from <a href="/wiki/Transuranic_waste" title="Transuranic waste">Transuranic waste</a>(TRU) - which are isotopes produced when U-238 captures a slow <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_neutron" title="Thermal neutron">thermal neutron</a> in a LWR but does not fission, all the remaining <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_level_waste" title="High level waste">high level waste</a>/fission products("FP") left over from reprocessing out the TRU fuel, is less radiotoxic(in <a href="/wiki/Sievert" title="Sievert">Sieverts</a>) than <a href="/wiki/Natural_uranium" title="Natural uranium">natural uranium</a>(in a gram to gram comparison) within 400 years, and it continues its decline following this.</p>
<p>Edwin Sayre has estimated that a ton of fission products(which also include the very weakly radioactive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palladium-107" title="Palladium-107">Palladium-107</a> etc.) reduced to metal, has a market value of $16 million.</p>
<p>The two forms of IFR waste produced, contain no plutonium or other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Actinides" title="Actinides">actinides</a>. The radioactivity of the waste decays to levels similar to the original ore in about 300â€“400 years.</p>
<p>The on-site reprocessing of fuel means that the volume of high level nuclear waste leaving the plant is tiny compared to LWR spent fuel. In fact, in the U.S. most spent LWR fuel has remained in storage at the reactor site instead of being transported for reprocessing or placement in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geological_repository" title="Geological repository">geological repository</a>. The smaller volumes of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_level_waste" title="High level waste">high level waste</a> from reprocessing could stay at reactor sites for some time, but are intensely radioactive from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medium-lived_fission_products" title="Medium-lived fission products">medium-lived fission products</a>(MLFPs) and need to be stored securely, like in the present <a href="/wiki/Dry_cask_storage" title="Dry cask storage">Dry cask storage</a> vessels. In its first few decades of use, before the MLFP's <a href="/wiki/Decay_heat" title="Decay heat">decay to lower heat producing levels</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geological_repository" title="Geological repository">geological repository</a> capacity is constrained not by volume but by heat generation, and <a href="/wiki/Decay_heat" title="Decay heat">decay heat</a> generation from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medium-lived_fission_products" title="Medium-lived fission products">medium-lived fission products</a> is about the same per unit power from any kind of fission reactor, limiting early repository emplacement.</p>
<p>The potential complete removal of plutonium from the waste stream of the reactor reduces the concern that presently exists with spent nuclear fuel from most other reactors that arises with burying or storing their spent fuel in a geological repository, as they could possibly be used as a <a href="/wiki/Radioactive_waste#Proliferation_concerns" title="Radioactive waste">plutonium mine</a> at some future date. "Despite the million-fold reduction in radiotoxicity offered by this scheme, some believe that actinide removal would offer few if any significant advantages for disposal in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geologic_repository" title="Geologic repository">geologic repository</a> because some of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission product</a> <a href="/wiki/Nuclide" title="Nuclide">nuclides</a> of greatest concern in scenarios such as <a href="/wiki/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leaching_(chemical_science)" title="Leaching (chemical science)">leaching</a> actually have longer half-lives than the radioactive actinides. These concerns do not consider the plan to store such materials in insoluble <a href="/wiki/Synroc" title="Synroc">Synroc</a>, and do not measure hazards in proportion to those from natural sources such as medical x-rays, cosmic rays, or natural radioactive rocks (such as <a href="/wiki/Granite" title="Granite">granite</a>). These persons are concerned with radioactive fission products such as <a href="/wiki/Technetium-99" title="Technetium-99">technetium-99</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iodine-129" title="Iodine-129">iodine-129</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cesium-135" title="Cesium-135">cesium-135</a> with half-lives between 213,000 and 15.7 million years" Some of which are being targeted for transmutation to belay even these comparatively low concerns, for example the IFR's <a href="/wiki/Void_coefficient" title="Void coefficient">positive void coefficient</a> could be reduced to an acceptable level by adding technetium to the core, helping destroy the long-lived fission product <a href="/wiki/Technetium-99" title="Technetium-99">technetium-99</a> by <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">nuclear transmutation</a> in the process.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fast_reactor" title="Fast reactor">Fast reactor</a> fuel must be at least 20% fissile, greater than the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_enriched_uranium" title="Low enriched uranium">low enriched uranium</a> used in LWRs. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile" title="Fissile">fissile</a> material could initially include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Highly_enriched_uranium" title="Highly enriched uranium">highly enriched uranium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, from LWR <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spent_fuel" title="Spent fuel">spent fuel</a>, decommissioned <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>, or other sources. During operation the reactor breeds more fissile material from <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile material</a>, at most about 5% more from uranium, and 1% more from thorium.</p>
<p>The fertile material in fast reactor fuel can be <a href="/wiki/Depleted_uranium" title="Depleted uranium">depleted uranium</a> (mostly <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">U-238</a>), <a href="/wiki/Natural_uranium" title="Natural uranium">natural uranium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thorium" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Reprocessed_uranium" title="Reprocessed uranium">reprocessed uranium</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spent_fuel" title="Spent fuel">spent fuel</a> from traditional light water reactors, and even include nonfissile <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_plutonium" title="Isotopes of plutonium">isotopes of plutonium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minor_actinide" title="Minor actinide">minor actinide</a> isotopes. Assuming no leakage of actinides to the waste stream during reprocessing, a 1GWe IFR-style reactor would consume about 1 ton of fertile material per year and produce about 1 ton of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_product" title="Fission product">fission products</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing#PYRO-A_and_-B_for_IFR" title="Nuclear reprocessing">The IFR fuel cycle's reprocessing</a> by <a href="/wiki/Pyroprocessing" title="Pyroprocessing">pyroprocessing</a> (in this case, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrorefining" title="Electrorefining">electrorefining</a>) does not need to produce pure plutonium free of fission product radioactivity as the <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a> process is designed to do. The purpose of reprocessing in the IFR fuel cycle is simply to reduce the level of those fission products that are <a href="/wiki/Neutron_poison" title="Neutron poison">neutron poisons</a>; even those need not be completely removed. The electrorefined spent fuel is highly radioactive, but because new fuel need not be precisely fabricated like LWR fuel pellets but can simply be cast, remote fabrication can be used, reducing exposure to workers.</p>
<p>Like any fast reactor, by changing the material used in the blankets, the IFR can be operated over a spectrum from breeder to self-sufficient to burner. In breeder mode (using <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238" title="Uranium-238">U-238</a> blankets) it will produce more fissile material than it consumes. This is useful for providing fissile material for starting up other plants. Using steel reflectors instead of U-238 blankets, the reactor operates in pure burner mode and is not a net creator of fissile material; on balance it will consume fissile and fertile material and, assuming loss-free reprocessing, output no <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Actinides" title="Actinides">actinides</a> but only <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fission_products" title="Fission products">fission products</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Activation_products" title="Activation products">activation products</a>. Amount of fissile material needed could be a limiting factor to very widespread deployment of fast reactors, if stocks of surplus weapons plutonium and LWR spent fuel plutonium are not sufficient. To maximize the rate at which fast reactors can be deployed, they can be operated in maximum breeding mode.</p>
<p>Because the <a href="/wiki/Uranium_market" title="Uranium market">current cost</a> of <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium" title="Enriched uranium">enriched uranium</a> is low compared to the expected cost of large-scale pyroprocessing and electrorefining equipment and the cost of building a secondary coolant loop, the higher fuel costs of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermal_reactor" title="Thermal reactor">thermal reactor</a> over the expected operating lifetime of the plant are offset by increased <a href="/wiki/Capital_cost" title="Capital cost">capital cost</a>. (Currently in the United States, utilities pay a flat rate of 1/10 of a cent per kilowatt hour to the Government for disposal of high level radioactive waste by law under the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act#Nuclear_Waste_Fund" title="Nuclear Waste Policy Act">Nuclear Waste Policy Act</a>. If this charge were based on the longevity of the waste, closed fuel cycles might become more financially competitive. As the planned geological repository in the form of <a href="/wiki/Yucca_Mountain" title="Yucca Mountain">Yucca Mountain</a> is not going ahead, this fund has collected over the years and presently $25 billion has piled up on the Government's doorstep for something they have not delivered, that is, reducing the hazard posed by the waste.</p>
<p>Reprocessing nuclear fuel using pyroprocessing and electrorefining has not yet been demonstrated on a commercial scale, so investing in a large IFR-style plant may be a higher <a href="/wiki/Financial_risk" title="Financial risk">financial risk</a> than a conventional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">light water reactor</a>.</p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Passive_safety">Passive safety</span></h3>
<p>The IFR uses metal alloy fuel (uranium/plutonium/zirconium) which is a good conductor of heat, unlike the LWR's (and even some fast breeder reactors') <a href="/wiki/Uranium_oxide" title="Uranium oxide">uranium oxide</a> which is a poor conductor of heat and reaches high temperatures at the center of fuel pellets. The IFR also has a smaller volume of fuel, since the fissile material is diluted with fertile material by a ratio of 5 or less, compared to about 30 for LWR fuel. The IFR core requires more heat removal per core volume during operation than the LWR core; but on the other hand, after a shutdown, there is far less trapped heat that is still diffusing out and needs to be removed. However, <a href="/wiki/Decay_heat" title="Decay heat">decay heat</a> generation from short-lived fission products and actinides is comparable in both cases, starting at a high level and decreasing with time elapsed after shutdown. The high volume of liquid sodium primary coolant in the pool configuration is designed to absorb decay heat without reaching fuel melting temperature. The primary sodium pumps are designed with flywheels so they will coast down slowly (90 seconds) if power is removed. This coast-down further aids core cooling upon shutdown. If the primary cooling loop were to be somehow suddenly stopped, or if the control rods were suddenly removed, the metal fuel can melt as accidentally demonstrated in EBR-I, however the melting fuel is then extruded up the steel fuel cladding tubes and out of the active core region leading to permanent reactor shutdown and no further fission heat generation or fuel melting. With metal fuel, the cladding is not breached and no radioactivity is released even in extreme overpower transients.</p>
<p>Self-regulation of the IFR's power level depends mainly on thermal expansion of the fuel which allows more neutrons to escape, damping the <a href="/wiki/Chain_reaction" title="Chain reaction">chain reaction</a>. LWRs have less effect from thermal expansion of fuel (since much of the core is the <a href="/wiki/Neutron_moderator" title="Neutron moderator">neutron moderator</a>) but have strong <a href="/wiki/Negative_feedback" title="Negative feedback">negative feedback</a> from <a href="/wiki/Doppler_broadening" title="Doppler broadening">Doppler broadening</a> (which acts on thermal and epithermal neutrons, not fast neutrons) and negative <a href="/wiki/Void_coefficient" title="Void coefficient">void coefficient</a> from boiling of the water moderator/coolant; the less dense steam returns fewer and less-thermalized neutrons to the fuel, which are more likely to be captured by U-238 than induce fissions. However, the IFR's positive void coefficient could be reduced to an acceptable level by adding technetium to the core, helping destroy the <a href="/wiki/Long-lived_fission_product" title="Long-lived fission product">long-lived fission product</a> <a href="/wiki/Technetium-99" title="Technetium-99">technetium-99</a> by <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation" title="Nuclear transmutation">nuclear transmutation</a> in the process.</p>
<p>IFRs are able to withstand both a <i>loss of flow without <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SCRAM" title="SCRAM">SCRAM</a></i> and <i>loss of heat sink without SCRAM</i>. In addition to passive shutdown of the reactor, the convection current generated in the primary coolant system will prevent fuel damage (core meltdown). These capabilities were demonstrated in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/EBR-II" title="EBR-II">EBR-II</a>. The ultimate goal is that no radioactivity will be released under any circumstance.</p>
<p>The flammability of sodium is a risk to operators. Sodium burns easily in air, and will ignite spontaneously on contact with water. The use of an intermediate coolant loop between the reactor and the turbines minimizes the risk of a sodium fire in the reactor core.</p>
<p>Under neutron bombardment, sodium-24 is produced. This is highly radioactive, emitting an energetic <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma ray</a> of 2.7 <a href="/wiki/Electronvolt" title="Electronvolt">MeV</a> followed by a beta decay to form magnesium-24. Half-life is only 15 hours, so this isotope is not a long-term hazard. Nevertheless, the presence of sodium-24 further necessitates the use of the intermediate coolant loop between the reactor and the turbines.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactor_grade_plutonium" title="Reactor grade plutonium">reactor grade plutonium</a></div>
<p>IFRs and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_water_reactor" title="Light water reactor">Light water reactors</a> (LWRs) both produce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactor_grade_plutonium" title="Reactor grade plutonium">reactor grade plutonium</a>, and even at high <a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnups</a> remains weapons usable, but the IFR fuel cycle has some design features that would make proliferation more difficult than the current <a href="/wiki/PUREX" title="PUREX">PUREX</a> recycling of spent LWR fuel. For one thing, it may operate at higher <a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnups</a> and therefore increase the relative abundance of the non-fissile, but fertile, isotopes <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-238" title="Plutonium-238">Plutonium-238</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-240" title="Plutonium-240">Plutonium-240</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-242" title="Plutonium-242">Plutonium-242</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike PUREX reprocessing, the IFR's electrolytic reprocessing of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spent_fuel" title="Spent fuel">spent fuel</a> did not separate out pure plutonium, and left it mixed with minor actinides and some rare earth fission products which make the theoretical ability to make a bomb directly out of it considerably dubious. Rather than being transported from a large centralized reprocessing plant to reactors at other locations, as is common now in France, from <a href="/wiki/La_Hague" title="La Hague">La Hague</a> to its dispersed nuclear fleet of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LWR" title="LWR">LWRs</a>, the IFR pyroprocessed fuel would be much more resistant to unauthorized diversion. The material with the mix of <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_plutonium" title="Isotopes of plutonium">plutonium isotopes</a> in an IFR would stay at the reactor site and then be burnt up practically in-situ, alternatively, if operated as a breeder reactor, some of the pyroprocessed fuel could be consumed by the same or other reactors located elsewhere. However, as is the case with conventional aqueous reprocessing, it would remain possible to chemically extract all the plutonium isotopes from the pyroprocessed/recycled fuel and would be much easier to do so from the recycled product than from the original spent fuel, although compared to other conventional recycled nuclear fuel, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MOX" title="MOX">MOX</a>, it would be more difficult, as the IFR recycled fuel contains more fission products than MOX and due to its higher <a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnup</a>, more proliferation resistant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pu-240" title="Pu-240">Pu-240</a> than MOX.</p>
<p>An advantage of the IFRs actinides removal and burn up (actinides include plutonium) from its spent fuel, is to eliminate concerns about leaving the IFRs spent fuel or indeed conventional, and therefore comparatively lower <a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnup</a>, spent fuel - which can contain weapons usable plutonium isotope concentrations in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geological_repository" title="Geological repository">geological repository</a>(or the more common <a href="/wiki/Dry_cask_storage" title="Dry cask storage">dry cask storage</a>) which then might be mined sometime in the future for the purpose of making weapons."</p>
<p>Because <a href="/wiki/Reactor-grade_plutonium" title="Reactor-grade plutonium">reactor-grade plutonium</a> contains <a href="/wiki/Isotopes_of_plutonium" title="Isotopes of plutonium">isotopes of plutonium</a> with high <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_fission" title="Spontaneous fission">spontaneous fission</a> rates, and the ratios of these troublesome isotopes-from a weapons manufacturing point of view, only increases as the fuel is <a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnt up</a> for longer and longer, it is considerably more difficult to produce fission nuclear weapons which will achieve a substantial yield from higher-<a href="/wiki/Burnup" title="Burnup">burnup</a> spent fuel than from conventional, moderately burnt up, LWR <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spent_fuel" title="Spent fuel">spent fuel</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, proliferation risks are considerably reduced with the IFR system by many metrics, but not entirely eliminated. The plutonium from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Advanced_Liquid_Metal_Reactor" title="Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor">ALMR</a> recycled fuel would have an isotopic composition similar to that obtained from other high burnt up <a href="/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel" title="Spent nuclear fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> sources. Although this makes the material less attractive for weapons production, it could be used in weapons at varying degrees of sophistication/with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fusion_boosting" title="Fusion boosting">fusion boosting</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. government <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactor_grade_plutonium_nuclear_test" title="Reactor grade plutonium nuclear test">detonated a nuclear device in 1962</a> using then defined "<a href="/wiki/Reactor-grade_plutonium" title="Reactor-grade plutonium">reactor-grade plutonium</a>", although in more recent categorizations it would instead be considered as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reactor_grade_plutonium#Classification_by_isotopic_composition" title="Reactor grade plutonium">fuel-grade plutonium</a>, typical of that produced by low burn up <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnox_reactor" title="Magnox reactor">magnox reactors</a>.</p>
<p>Plutonium produced in the fuel of a breeder reactor generally has a higher fraction of the isotope <a href="/wiki/Plutonium-240" title="Plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a>, than that produced in other reactors, making it less attractive for weapons use, particularly in first generation <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design" title="Nuclear weapon design">nuclear weapon designs</a> similar to <a href="/wiki/Fat_Man" title="Fat Man">Fat Man</a>. This offers an intrinsic degree of proliferation resistance, but the plutonium made in the blanket of uranium surrounding the core, if such a blanket is used, is usually of a high <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pu-239" title="Pu-239">Pu-239</a> quality, containing very little Pu-240, making it highly attractive for weapons use.</p>
<p>"Although some recent proposals for the future of the ALMR/IFR concept have focused more on its ability to transform and irreversibly use up plutonium, such as the conceptual <a href="/wiki/PRISM_(reactor)" title="PRISM (reactor)">PRISM (reactor)</a> and the in operation(2014) <a href="/wiki/BN-800_reactor" title="BN-800 reactor">BN-800 reactor</a> in Russia, the developers of the IFR acknowledge that it is 'uncontested that the IFR can be configured as a net producer of plutonium'."</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if operated not as a burner, but as a breeder, the IFR has a clear proliferation potential "if instead of processing spent fuel, the ALMR system were used to reprocess <i>irradiated <a href="/wiki/Fertile_material" title="Fertile material">fertile (breeding) material</a></i> (that is if a blanket of breeding U-238 was used), the resulting plutonium would be a superior material, with a nearly ideal isotope composition for nuclear weapons manufacture."</p>

<p>A commercial version of the IFR, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/S-PRISM" title="S-PRISM">S-PRISM</a>, can be built in a factory and transported to the site. This <a href="/wiki/Small_modular_reactor" title="Small modular reactor">small modular</a> design (311 MWe modules) reduces costs and allows nuclear plants of various sizes (311 MWe and any integer multiple) to be economically constructed.</p>
<p>Cost assessments taking account of the complete life cycle show that fast reactors could be no more expensive than the most widely used reactors in the world â€“ water-moderated water-cooled reactors.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/BN-600_reactor" title="BN-600 reactor">BN-600 reactor</a></div>
<p>Unlike reactors that use relatively slow low energy (thermal) neutrons, <a href="/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor" title="Fast-neutron reactor">fast-neutron reactors</a> need <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_coolant" title="Nuclear reactor coolant">nuclear reactor coolant</a> that does not moderate or block neutrons (like water does in an LWR) so that they have sufficient energy to fission <a href="/wiki/Actinide" title="Actinide">actinide</a> isotopes that are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissionable" title="Fissionable">fissionable</a> but not <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fissile" title="Fissile">fissile</a>. The core must also be compact and contain as small amount of material that might act as neutron moderators as possible. Metal sodium (Na) coolant in many ways has the most attractive combination of properties for this purpose. In addition to not being a neutron moderator, desirable physical characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low melting temperature</li>
<li>Low vapor pressure</li>
<li>High boiling temperature</li>
<li>Excellent thermal conductivity</li>
<li>Low viscosity</li>
<li>Light weight</li>
<li>Thermal and radiation stability</li>
</ul>
<p>Other benefits:</p>
<p>Abundant and low cost material. Cleaning with chlorine produces non-toxic table salt. Compatible with other materials used in the core (does not react or dissolve stainless steel) so no special corrosion protection measures needed. Low pumping power (from light weight and low viscosity). Maintains an oxygen (and water) free environment by reacting with trace amounts to make sodium oxide or sodium hydroxide and hydrogen, thereby protecting other components from corrosion. Light weight (low density) improves resistance to seismic inertia events (earthquakes.)</p>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<p>Extreme fire hazard with any significant amounts of air (oxygen) and spontaneous combustion with water, rendering sodium leaks and flooding dangerous. This was the case at the <a href="/wiki/Monju_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="Monju Nuclear Power Plant">Monju Nuclear Power Plant</a> in a 1995 accident and fire. Reactions with water produce hydrogen which can be explosive. Sodium activation product (isotope) Na releases dangerous energetic photons when it decays (however it has a very short half-life of 15 hours). Reactor design keeps Na in the reactor pool and carries away heat for power production using a secondary sodium loop, adding costs to construction and maintenance.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Research on the reactor began in 1984 at <a href="/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory" title="Argonne National Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a> in Argonne, Illinois. Argonne is a part of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Energy" title="U.S. Department of Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a>'s national laboratory system, and is operated on a contract by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>Argonne previously had a branch campus named "Argonne West" in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Idaho_Falls" title="Idaho Falls">Idaho Falls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Idaho" title="Idaho">Idaho</a> that is now part of the <a href="/wiki/Idaho_National_Laboratory" title="Idaho National Laboratory">Idaho National Laboratory</a>. In the past, at the branch campus, physicists from Argonne had built what was known as the <a href="/wiki/Experimental_Breeder_Reactor_II" title="Experimental Breeder Reactor II">Experimental Breeder Reactor II</a> (EBR II). In the mean time, physicists at Argonne had designed the IFR concept, and it was decided that the EBR II would be converted to an IFR. Charles Till, a Canadian physicist from Argonne, was the head of the IFR project, and Yoon Chang was the deputy head. Till was positioned in Idaho, while Chang was in Illinois.</p>
<p>With the election of President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> in 1992, and the appointment of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hazel_O%27Leary" title="Hazel O'Leary">Hazel O'Leary</a> as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secretary_of_Energy" title="Secretary of Energy">Secretary of Energy</a>, there was pressure from the top to cancel the IFR. Sen. <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> (D-MA) and O'Leary led the opposition to the reactor, arguing that it would be a threat to non-proliferation efforts, and that it was a continuation of the <a href="/wiki/Clinch_River_Breeder_Reactor_Project" title="Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project">Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project</a> that had been canceled by Congress.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, in 1994 Energy Secretary O'Leary awarded the lead IFR scientist with $10,000 and a gold medal, with the citation stating his work to develop IFR technology provided "improved safety, more efficient use of fuel and less radioactive waste."</p>
<p>IFR opponents also presented a report by the DOE's Office of Nuclear Safety regarding a former Argonne employee's allegations that Argonne had retaliated against him for raising concerns about safety, as well as about the quality of research done on the IFR program. The report received international attention, with a notable difference in the coverage it received from major scientific publications. The British journal <i>Nature</i> entitled its article "Report backs whistleblower", and also noted conflicts of interest on the part of a DOE panel that assessed IFR research. In contrast, the article that appeared in <i>Science</i> was entitled "Was Argonne Whistleblower Really Blowing Smoke?". Remarkably, that article did not disclose that the Director of Argonne National Laboratories, Alan Schriesheim, was a member of the Board of Directors of <i>Science'</i>s parent organization, the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>Despite support for the reactor by then-Rep. <a href="/wiki/Dick_Durbin" title="Dick Durbin">Richard Durbin</a> (D-IL) and U.S. Senators <a href="/wiki/Carol_Moseley_Braun" title="Carol Moseley Braun">Carol Moseley Braun</a> (D-IL) and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Simon_(politician)" title="Paul Simon (politician)">Paul Simon</a> (D-IL), funding for the reactor was slashed, and it was ultimately canceled in 1994 by <a class="external text" href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00175" rel="nofollow">S.Amdt. 2127 to H.R. 4506</a>, at greater cost than finishing it. When this was brought to President Clinton's attention, he said "I know; it's a symbol." By this time Senator Kerry and the majority of democrats had switched to supporting the continuation of the program. The final count was to 52 to 46 to terminate the program, with 36 republicans and 16 democrats voting for it's termination, while just 8 republicans and 38 democrats voted for it's continuation. <a class="external text" href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00175#position" rel="nofollow">Vote Total</a></p>
<p>In 2001, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" title="Generation IV reactor">Generation IV</a> roadmap, the DOE tasked a 242-person team of scientists from DOE, UC Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, ANL, LLNL, Toshiba, Westinghouse, Duke, EPRI, and other institutions to evaluate 19 of the best reactor designs on 27 different criteria. The IFR ranked #1 in their study which was released April 9, 2002.</p>
<p>At present there are no Integral Fast Reactors in commercial operation, however a very similar fast reactor, operated as a burner of plutonium stockpiles, the <a href="/wiki/BN-800_reactor" title="BN-800 reactor">BN-800 reactor</a>, became commercially operational in 2014.</p>
