<p>A <b>volcano</b> is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rupture_(engineering)" title="Rupture (engineering)">rupture</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Crust_(geology)" title="Crust (geology)">crust</a> of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Planetary-mass_object" title="Planetary-mass object">planetary-mass object</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, that allows hot <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a>, <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">volcanic ash</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_gas" title="Volcanic gas">gases</a> to escape from a <a href="/wiki/Magma_chamber" title="Magma chamber">magma chamber</a> below the surface.</p>
<p>Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid <a href="/wiki/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">tectonic plates</a> that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are <a href="/wiki/Divergent_boundary" title="Divergent boundary">diverging</a> or <a href="/wiki/Convergent_boundary" title="Convergent boundary">converging</a>. For example, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mid-oceanic_ridge" title="Mid-oceanic ridge">mid-oceanic ridge</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" title="Mid-Atlantic Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pacific_Ring_of_Fire" title="Pacific Ring of Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a> has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's <span class="clarify-content" style="padding-left:0.1em; padding-right:0.1em; color:#595959; border:1px solid #DDD;">interior plates</span>, e.g., in the <a href="/wiki/East_African_Rift" title="East African Rift">East African Rift</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Wells_Gray-Clearwater_volcanic_field" title="Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field">Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rio_Grande_Rift" title="Rio Grande Rift">Rio Grande Rift</a> in North America. This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of "plate hypothesis" volcanism. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as <a href="/wiki/Mantle_plume" title="Mantle plume">mantle plumes</a>. These so-called "<a href="/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)" title="Hotspot (geology)">hotspots</a>", for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling <a href="/wiki/Diapir" title="Diapir">diapirs</a> with magma from the <a href="/wiki/Core%E2%80%93mantle_boundary" title="Core–mantle boundary">core–mantle boundary</a>, 3,000 km deep in the Earth. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.</p>
<p>Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. One such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with <a href="/wiki/Jet_engine" title="Jet engine">jet engines</a> where ash particles can be melted by the high <a href="/wiki/Operating_temperature" title="Operating temperature">operating temperature</a>; the melted particles then adhere to the <a href="/wiki/Turbine" title="Turbine">turbine</a> blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> obscure the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">sun</a> and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere (or <a href="/wiki/Troposphere" title="Troposphere">troposphere</a>); however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the upper atmosphere (or <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>).

<p>The word <i>volcano</i> is derived from the name of <a href="/wiki/Vulcano" title="Vulcano">Vulcano</a>, a volcanic island in the <a href="/wiki/Aeolian_Islands" title="Aeolian Islands">Aeolian Islands</a> of Italy whose name in turn comes from <a href="/wiki/Vulcan_(mythology)" title="Vulcan (mythology)">Vulcan</a>, the god of fire in <a href="/wiki/Roman_mythology" title="Roman mythology">Roman mythology</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Subduction" title="Subduction">Subduction</a> zones are places where two plates, usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate, collide. In this case, the oceanic plate subducts, or submerges under the continental plate forming a deep ocean trench just offshore.

<p>"<a href="/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)" title="Hotspot (geology)">Hotspots</a>" is the name given to volcanic areas believed to be formed by <a href="/wiki/Mantle_plume" title="Mantle plume">mantle plumes</a>, which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary in a fixed space that causes large-volume melting. Because tectonic plates move across them, each volcano becomes dormant and is eventually reformed as the plate advances over the postulated plume.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Volcanic_features">Volcanic features</span></h2>


<p>The most common perception of a volcano is of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cone_(geometry)" title="Cone (geometry)">conical</a> mountain, spewing <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a> and poisonous <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_gas" title="Volcanic gas">gases</a> from a <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_crater" title="Volcanic crater">crater</a> at its summit; however, this describes just one of the many types of volcano. The features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors. Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by <a href="/wiki/Lava_dome" title="Lava dome">lava domes</a> rather than a summit crater while others have <a href="/wiki/Landscape" title="Landscape">landscape</a> features such as massive <a href="/wiki/Plateau" title="Plateau">plateaus</a>. Vents that issue volcanic material (including <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">ash</a>) and gases (mainly <a href="/wiki/Volcano#Effects_of_volcanoes" title="Volcano">steam and magmatic gases</a>) can develop anywhere on the <a href="/wiki/Landform" title="Landform">landform</a> and may give rise to smaller cones such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pu%27u_%27%C5%8C%27%C5%8D" title="Pu'u 'Ō'ō">Pu<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>u <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō</a> on a flank of Hawaii's <a href="/wiki/K%C4%ABlauea" title="Kīlauea">Kīlauea</a>. Other types of volcano include <a href="/wiki/Cryovolcano" title="Cryovolcano">cryovolcanoes</a> (or ice volcanoes), particularly on some moons of <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Mud_volcano" title="Mud volcano">mud volcanoes</a>, which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity. Active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Igneous" title="Igneous">igneous</a> volcanoes except when the mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Fissure_vent" title="Fissure vent">Fissure vent</a></div>
<p>Volcanic <b>fissure vents</b> are flat, linear fractures through which <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a> emerges.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shield_volcanoes">Shield volcanoes</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Shield_volcano" title="Shield volcano">Shield volcano</a></div>
<p><b>Shield volcanoes</b>, so named for their broad, shield-like profiles, are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great distance from a vent. They generally do not explode catastrophically. Since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica, shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings. The Hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones, and they are common in <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, as well.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lava_domes">Lava domes</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Lava_dome" title="Lava dome">Lava dome</a></div>
<p><b>Lava domes</b> are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava. They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption, as in the case of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mount_Saint_Helens" title="Mount Saint Helens">Mount Saint Helens</a>, but can also form independently, as in the case of <a href="/wiki/Lassen_Peak" title="Lassen Peak">Lassen Peak</a>. Like stratovolcanoes, they can produce violent, explosive eruptions, but their lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cryptodomes">Cryptodomes</span></h3>
<p><b>Cryptodomes</b> are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge. The <a href="/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens" title="1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens">1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens</a> was an example; lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge which slid down the north side of the mountain.</p>

These can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high. Most cinder cones erupt only <a href="/wiki/Monogenetic_volcanic_field" title="Monogenetic volcanic field">once</a>. Cinder cones may form as <a href="/wiki/Parasitic_cone" title="Parasitic cone">flank vents</a> on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own. <a href="/wiki/Par%C3%ADcutin" title="Parícutin">Parícutin</a> in Mexico and <a href="/wiki/Sunset_Crater" title="Sunset Crater">Sunset Crater</a> in <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> are examples of cinder cones.

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Stratovolcano" title="Stratovolcano">Stratovolcano</a></div>
<p><b>Stratovolcanoes</b> or <b>composite volcanoes</b> are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the <a href="/wiki/Stratum" title="Stratum">strata</a> that gives rise to the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Strato/composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash, and lava. Cinders and ash pile on top of each other, lava flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats. Classic examples include <a href="/wiki/Mount_Fuji" title="Mount Fuji">Mount Fuji</a> in Japan, <a href="/wiki/Mayon_Volcano" title="Mayon Volcano">Mayon Volcano</a> in the Philippines, and <a href="/wiki/Mount_Vesuvius" title="Mount Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stromboli" title="Stromboli">Stromboli</a> in Italy.</p>

Not only do stratovolcanoes have greater pressure build up from the underlying lava flow than shield volcanoes, but their fissure vents and <a href="/wiki/Monogenetic_volcanic_field" title="Monogenetic volcanic field">monogenetic volcanic fields</a> (volcanic cones) have more powerful eruptions, as they are many times under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extension_(geology)" title="Extension (geology)">extension</a>. They are also steeper than shield volcanoes, with slopes of 30–35° compared to slopes of generally 5–10°, and their loose <a href="/wiki/Tephra" title="Tephra">tephra</a> are material for dangerous <a href="/wiki/Lahar" title="Lahar">lahars</a>.

<p>A <b>supervolcano</b> usually has a large <a href="/wiki/Caldera" title="Caldera">caldera</a> and can produce devastation on an enormous, sometimes continental, scale. Such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> and ash released into the atmosphere. They are the most dangerous type of volcano.

Because of the enormous area they may cover, supervolcanoes are hard to identify centuries after an eruption. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/Large_igneous_province" title="Large igneous province">large igneous provinces</a> are also considered supervolcanoes because of the vast amount of <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basalt</a> lava erupted (even though the lava flow is <a href="/wiki/Effusive_eruption" title="Effusive eruption">non-explosive</a>).</p>

<p><b>Submarine volcanoes</b> are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface.

Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. <a href="/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent" title="Hydrothermal vent">Hydrothermal vents</a> are common near these volcanoes, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_smoker" title="Black smoker">some support peculiar ecosystems</a> based on dissolved minerals.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lava_composition">Lava composition</span></h3>
<p>Another way of classifying volcanoes is by the <i>composition of material erupted</i> (lava), since this affects the shape of the volcano. Lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions (Cas &amp; Wright, 1987):</p>
<ul>
<li>If the erupted <a href="/wiki/Magma" title="Magma">magma</a> contains a high percentage (&gt;63%) of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silica" title="Silica">silica</a>, the lava is called <a href="/wiki/Felsic" title="Felsic">felsic</a>.
<ul>
<li>Felsic lavas (<a href="/wiki/Dacite" title="Dacite">dacites</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rhyolite" title="Rhyolite">rhyolites</a>) tend to be highly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viscous" title="Viscous">viscous</a> (not very fluid) and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows. Viscous lavas tend to form <a href="/wiki/Stratovolcano" title="Stratovolcano">stratovolcanoes</a> or lava domes. <a href="/wiki/Lassen_Peak" title="Lassen Peak">Lassen Peak</a> in California is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome.</li>
<li>Because siliceous magmas are so viscous, they tend to trap <a href="/wiki/Volatiles#Igneous_petrology" title="Volatiles">volatiles</a> (gases) that are present, which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically, eventually forming stratovolcanoes. <a href="/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow" title="Pyroclastic flow">Pyroclastic flows</a> (<a href="/wiki/Ignimbrite" title="Ignimbrite">ignimbrites</a>) are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes, since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere, so they hug the volcano's slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions. Temperatures as high as 1,200 °C are known to occur in pyroclastic flows, which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down, often up to many meters thick. <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Valley_of_Ten_Thousand_Smokes" title="Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes">Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes</a>, formed by the eruption of <a href="/wiki/Novarupta" title="Novarupta">Novarupta</a> near <a href="/wiki/Mount_Katmai" title="Mount Katmai">Katmai</a> in 1912, is an example of a thick pyroclastic flow or ignimbrite deposit. Volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a <a href="/wiki/Tuff" title="Tuff">tuff</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the erupted magma contains 52–63% silica, the lava is of <i>intermediate</i> composition.
<ul>
<li>These "<a href="/wiki/Andesite" title="Andesite">andesitic</a>" volcanoes generally only occur above <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subduction_zone" title="Subduction zone">subduction zones</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Mount_Merapi" title="Mount Merapi">Mount Merapi</a> in Indonesia).</li>
<li>Andesitic lava is typically formed at <a href="/wiki/Convergent_boundary" title="Convergent boundary">convergent boundary</a> margins of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tectonic_plate" title="Tectonic plate">tectonic plates</a>, by several processes:
<ul>
<li>Hydration melting of peridotite and fractional crystallization

</li>
<li>Melting of subducted <a href="/wiki/Slab_(geology)" title="Slab (geology)">slab</a> containing sediments</li>
<li>Magma mixing between felsic rhyolitic and mafic basaltic magmas in an intermediate reservoir prior to emplacement or lava flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the erupted magma contains &lt;52% and &gt;45% silica, the lava is called <a href="/wiki/Mafic" title="Mafic">mafic</a> (because it contains higher percentages of <a href="/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> (Mg) and iron (Fe)) or <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basaltic</a>. These lavas are usually much less viscous than rhyolitic lavas, depending on their eruption temperature; they also tend to be hotter than felsic lavas. Mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lava_texture">Lava texture</span></h3>
<p>Two types of lava are named according to the surface texture: <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>A<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>a (pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><a href="/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Hawaiian" title="Help:IPA for Hawaiian">[ˈʔaʔa]</a></span>) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/P%C4%81hoehoe" title="Pāhoehoe">pāhoehoe</a> (<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><a href="/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Hawaiian" title="Help:IPA for Hawaiian">[paːˈho.eˈho.e]</a></span>), both <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_language" title="Hawaiian language">Hawaiian</a> words. <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>A<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>a is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is the typical texture of viscous lava flows.

<p>Pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Usually, only mafic flows will erupt as pāhoehoe, since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow with greater fluidity.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Popular_classification_of_volcanoes">Popular classification of volcanoes</span></h3>
<p>A popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes is by their frequency of <a href="/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions" title="Types of volcanic eruptions">eruption</a>, with those that erupt regularly called <b>active</b>, those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called <b>dormant</b> or <b>inactive</b>, and those that have not erupted in historical times called <b>extinct</b>. However, these popular classifications—extinct in particular—are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which refer to a particular volcano's formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes, which was explained above.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Active">Active</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Category:Active_volcanoes" title="Category:Active volcanoes">Category:Active volcanoes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Category:Potentially_active_volcanoes" title="Category:Potentially active volcanoes">Category:Potentially active volcanoes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_currently_erupting_volcanoes" title="List of currently erupting volcanoes">List of currently erupting volcanoes</a></div>
<p>There is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an "active" volcano. The lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years, making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations. For example, many of Earth's volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption. Given the long lifespan of such volcanoes, they are very active. By human lifespans, however, they are not.</p>
<p>Scientists usually consider a volcano to be <i>erupting</i> or <i>likely to erupt</i> if it is currently erupting, or showing signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions. Most scientists consider a volcano <i>active</i> if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years (<a href="/wiki/Holocene" title="Holocene">Holocene</a> times) – the Smithsonian <a href="/wiki/Global_Volcanism_Program" title="Global Volcanism Program">Global Volcanism Program</a> uses this definition of <i>active</i>. Most volcanoes are situated on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pacific_Ring_of_Fire" title="Pacific Ring of Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>. An estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes.</p>
<p><i>Historical time</i> (or recorded history) is another timeframe for <i>active</i>. The <i>Catalogue of the Active Volcanoes of the World</i>, published by the <a href="/wiki/International_Association_of_Volcanology_and_Chemistry_of_the_Earth%27s_Interior" title="International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior">International Association of Volcanology</a>, uses this definition, by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes. However, the span of recorded history differs from region to region. In China and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, it reaches back nearly 3,000 years, but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, it reaches back less than 300 years, and in Hawaii and <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, only around 200 years.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">"Extinct volcano" redirects here. For the category [of extinct volcanoes], see <a href="/wiki/Category:Extinct_volcanoes" title="Category:Extinct volcanoes">Category:Extinct volcanoes</a>.</div>


<p>Extinct volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again because the volcano no longer has a magma supply. Examples of extinct volcanoes are many volcanoes on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hawaiian_%E2%80%93_Emperor_seamount_chain" title="Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain">Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain</a> in the Pacific Ocean, <a href="/wiki/Hohentwiel" title="Hohentwiel">Hohentwiel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shiprock" title="Shiprock">Shiprock</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Zuidwal_volcano" title="Zuidwal volcano">Zuidwal volcano</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle" title="Edinburgh Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a> in Scotland is famously located atop an extinct volcano. Otherwise, whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since "supervolcano" <a href="/wiki/Caldera" title="Caldera">calderas</a> can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered dormant instead of extinct. Some volcanologists refer to extinct volcanoes as inactive, though the term is now more commonly used for dormant volcanoes once thought to be extinct.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Dormant">Dormant</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">See also: <a href="/wiki/Category:Dormant_volcanoes" title="Category:Dormant volcanoes">Category:Dormant volcanoes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Category:Inactive_volcanoes" title="Category:Inactive volcanoes">Category:Inactive volcanoes</a></div>

<p>It is difficult to distinguish an extinct volcano from a dormant (inactive) one. Volcanoes are often considered to be extinct if there are no written records of its activity. Nevertheless, volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time. For example, <a href="/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera" title="Yellowstone Caldera">Yellowstone</a> has a repose/recharge period of around 700,000 years, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toba_Lake" title="Toba Lake">Toba</a> of around 380,000 years. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vesuvius" title="Vesuvius">Vesuvius</a> was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its <a href="/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79" title="Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79">eruption of AD 79</a>, which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Before its catastrophic eruption of 1991, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pinatubo" title="Pinatubo">Pinatubo</a> was an inconspicuous volcano, unknown to most people in the surrounding areas. Two other examples are the long-dormant <a href="/wiki/Soufri%C3%A8re_Hills" title="Soufrière Hills">Soufrière Hills</a> volcano on the island of <a href="/wiki/Montserrat" title="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>, thought to be extinct before activity resumed in 1995 and <a href="/wiki/Fourpeaked_Mountain" title="Fourpeaked Mountain">Fourpeaked Mountain</a> in <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, which, before its September 2006 eruption, had not erupted since before 8000 BC and had long been thought to be extinct.</p>

<p>The three common popular classifications of volcanoes can be subjective and some volcanoes thought to have been extinct have erupted again. To help prevent people from falsely believing they are not at risk when living on or near a volcano, countries have adopted new classifications to describe the various levels and stages of volcanic activity. Some alert systems use different numbers or colors to designate the different stages. Other systems use colors and words. Some systems use a combination of both.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Volcano_warning_schemes_of_the_United_States">Volcano warning schemes of the United States</span></h4>
<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted a common system nationwide for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes. The new volcano alert-level system classifies volcanoes now as being in a normal, advisory, watch or warning stage. Additionally, colors are used to denote the amount of ash produced.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_of_volcanoes">Effects of volcanoes</span></h2>



<p>There are many different <a href="/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions" title="Types of volcanic eruptions">types of volcanic eruptions</a> and associated activity: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phreatic_eruptions" title="Phreatic eruptions">phreatic eruptions</a> (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silica" title="Silica">silica</a> lava (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Rhyolite" title="Rhyolite">rhyolite</a>), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basalt</a>), <a href="/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow" title="Pyroclastic flow">pyroclastic flows</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lahar" title="Lahar">lahars</a> (debris flow) and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emission.

Earthquakes, <a href="/wiki/Hot_spring" title="Hot spring">hot springs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fumarole" title="Fumarole">fumaroles</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mud_pot" title="Mud pot">mud pots</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geyser" title="Geyser">geysers</a> often accompany volcanic activity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Volcanic_gases">Volcanic gases</span></h3>
<p>The concentrations of different <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_gas" title="Volcanic gas">volcanic gases</a> can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. <a href="/wiki/Water_vapor" title="Water vapor">Water vapor</a> is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>. Other principal volcanic gases include <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride" title="Hydrogen chloride">hydrogen chloride</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_fluoride" title="Hydrogen fluoride">hydrogen fluoride</a>. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Halocarbon" title="Halocarbon">halocarbons</a>, organic compounds, and volatile metal chlorides.</p>
<p>Large, explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and <a href="/wiki/Pumice" title="Pumice">pumice</a>) into the <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a> to heights of 16–32 kilometres (10–20 mi) above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to <a href="/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a> (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine <a href="/wiki/Sulfate" title="Sulfate">sulfate</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aerosols" title="Aerosols">aerosols</a>. The SO<sub>2</sub> emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact. The aerosols increase the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Albedo" title="Albedo">albedo</a>—its reflection of radiation from the <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> back into space—and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the <a href="/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree (Fahrenheit scale) for periods of one to three years; sulfur dioxide from the eruption of <a href="/wiki/Huaynaputina" title="Huaynaputina">Huaynaputina</a> probably caused the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1601%E2%80%931603" title="Russian famine of 1601–1603">Russian famine of 1601–1603</a>.</p>

<p>One proposed <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_winter" title="Volcanic winter">volcanic winter</a> happened c. 70,000 years ago following the <a href="/wiki/Supervolcano" title="Supervolcano">supereruption</a> of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Toba" title="Lake Toba">Lake Toba</a> on Sumatra island in Indonesia. According to the <a href="/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory" title="Toba catastrophe theory">Toba catastrophe theory</a> to which some anthropologists and archeologists subscribe, it had global consequences, killing most humans then alive and creating a <a href="/wiki/Population_bottleneck" title="Population bottleneck">population bottleneck</a> that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today. The 1815 eruption of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Tambora" title="Mount Tambora">Mount Tambora</a> created global climate anomalies that became known as the "<a href="/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer" title="Year Without a Summer">Year Without a Summer</a>" because of the effect on North American and European weather. Agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in one of the worst famines of the 19th century. The freezing winter of 1740–41, which led to widespread <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irish_Famine_(1740%E2%80%931741)" title="Irish Famine (1740–1741)">famine</a> in northern Europe, may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that volcanic activity caused or contributed to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ordovician-Silurian_extinction_events" title="Ordovician-Silurian extinction events">End-Ordovician</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Permian-Triassic_extinction_event" title="Permian-Triassic extinction event">Permian-Triassic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Late_Devonian_extinction" title="Late Devonian extinction">Late Devonian</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mass_extinction" title="Mass extinction">mass extinctions</a>, and possibly others.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acid_rain">Acid rain</span></h3>

<p>Sulfate aerosols promote complex <a href="/wiki/Chemical_reaction" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reactions</a> on their surfaces that alter chlorine and <a href="/wiki/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> chemical species in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> levels from <a href="/wiki/Haloalkane" title="Haloalkane">chlorofluorocarbon</a> pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys <a href="/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> (O<sub>3</sub>). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for <a href="/wiki/Cirrus_cloud" title="Cirrus cloud">cirrus clouds</a> and further modify the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eruption_cloud" title="Eruption cloud">eruption cloud</a> and quickly fall to the ground as <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of <a href="/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> for biogeochemical cycles.</p>
<p>Gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain. Volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yottagram" title="Yottagram">teragrams</a> (145 million to 255 million <a href="/wiki/Short_ton" title="Short ton">short tons</a>) of <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> each year.

Large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> mainly by cooling it. Volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to <a href="/wiki/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Weathering" title="Weathering">weathering</a> process of volcanic rocks. These fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops. Volcanic eruptions can also create new islands, as the magma cools and solidifies upon contact with the water.</p>

<p>The planet <a href="/wiki/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> has a surface that is 90% <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basalt</a>, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface.

Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano <a href="/wiki/Maat_Mons" title="Maat Mons">Maat Mons</a>, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.</p>

<p>There are several extinct volcanoes on <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include <a href="/wiki/Arsia_Mons" title="Arsia Mons">Arsia Mons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ascraeus_Mons" title="Ascraeus Mons">Ascraeus Mons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hecates_Tholus" title="Hecates Tholus">Hecates Tholus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Olympus_Mons" title="Olympus Mons">Olympus Mons</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pavonis_Mons" title="Pavonis Mons">Pavonis Mons</a>. These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years, but the European <i><a href="/wiki/Mars_Express" title="Mars Express">Mars Express</a></i> spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">moon</a> <a href="/wiki/Io_(moon)" title="Io (moon)">Io</a> is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tides" title="Tides">tidal</a> interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="Sulfur dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silicate" title="Silicate">silicate</a> rock, and as a result, <a href="/wiki/Io_(moon)" title="Io (moon)">Io</a> is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 °C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on Io. <a href="/wiki/Europa_(moon)" title="Europa (moon)">Europa</a>, the smallest of Jupiter's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Galilean_moon" title="Galilean moon">Galilean moons</a>, also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cryovolcanism" title="Cryovolcanism">cryovolcanism</a>, and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solar_system" title="Solar system">solar system</a>.</p>
<p>In 1989 the <a href="/wiki/Voyager_2" title="Voyager 2">Voyager 2</a> spacecraft observed <a href="/wiki/Cryovolcano" title="Cryovolcano">cryovolcanoes</a> (ice volcanoes) on <a href="/wiki/Triton_(moon)" title="Triton (moon)">Triton</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">moon</a> of <a href="/wiki/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>, and in 2005 the <a href="/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens" title="Cassini–Huygens">Cassini–Huygens</a> probe photographed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enceladus_(moon)#Cryovolcanism" title="Enceladus (moon)">fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus</a>, a moon of <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>. The ejecta may be composed of water, <a href="/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen" title="Liquid nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a>, dust, or <a href="/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> compounds. Cassini–Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturnian</a> moon <a href="/wiki/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a>, which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere. It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kuiper_Belt_Object" title="Kuiper Belt Object">Kuiper Belt Object</a> <a href="/wiki/50000_Quaoar" title="50000 Quaoar">Quaoar</a>.</p>
<p>A 2010 study of the <a href="/wiki/Exoplanet" title="Exoplanet">exoplanet</a> <a href="/wiki/COROT-7b" title="COROT-7b">COROT-7b</a>, which was detected by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transit_method" title="Transit method">transit</a> in 2009, suggested that <a href="/wiki/Tidal_heating" title="Tidal heating">tidal heating</a> from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on Io.</p>

<p>Many ancient accounts ascribe volcanic eruptions to <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> causes, such as the actions of <a href="/wiki/Deity" title="Deity">gods</a> or <a href="/wiki/Demigod" title="Demigod">demigods</a>. To the ancient Greeks, volcanoes' capricious power could only be explained as acts of the gods, while 16th/17th-century German astronomer <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> believed they were ducts for the Earth's tears. One early idea counter to this was proposed by <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Jesus" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> <a href="/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher" title="Athanasius Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a> (1602–1680), who witnessed eruptions of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Etna" title="Mount Etna">Mount Etna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stromboli" title="Stromboli">Stromboli</a>, then visited the crater of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vesuvius" title="Vesuvius">Vesuvius</a> and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitumen" title="Bitumen">bitumen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>.</p>
<p>Various explanations were proposed for volcano behavior before the modern understanding of the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Mantle_(geology)" title="Mantle (geology)">mantle</a> structure as a semisolid material was developed. For decades after awareness that compression and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radioactive" title="Radioactive">radioactive</a> materials may be heat sources, their contributions were specifically discounted. Volcanic action was often attributed to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemical</a> reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface.</p>
