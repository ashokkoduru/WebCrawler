<p><a href="/wiki/Siemens_%26_Halske" title="Siemens &amp; Halske">Siemens &amp; Halske</a> was founded by <a href="/wiki/Werner_von_Siemens" title="Werner von Siemens">Werner von Siemens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johann_Georg_Halske" title="Johann Georg Halske">Johann Georg Halske</a> on 12 October 1847. Based on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telegraph" title="Telegraph">telegraph</a>, his invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters, instead of using <a href="/wiki/Morse_code" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>. The company, then called <i>Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske</i>, opened its first workshop on 12 October.</p>
<p>In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500 km from Berlin to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frankfurt_am_Main" title="Frankfurt am Main">Frankfurt am Main</a>. In 1850, the founder's younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, later <a href="/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Siemens" title="Carl Wilhelm Siemens">Sir William Siemens</a>, started to represent the company in London. The <a href="/wiki/Siemens_Brothers" title="Siemens Brothers">London agency</a> became a branch office in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, <a href="/wiki/Carl_Heinrich_von_Siemens" title="Carl Heinrich von Siemens">Carl Heinrich von Siemens</a>, opened in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St_Petersburg" title="St Petersburg">St Petersburg</a>, Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European (<a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>) telegraph line.</p>

<p>In 1867, Werner von Siemens described a <a href="/wiki/Dynamo" title="Dynamo">dynamo</a> without permanent magnets. A similar system was also independently invented by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone" title="Charles Wheatstone">Charles Wheatstone</a>, but Siemens became the first company to build such devices. In 1881, a Siemens <a href="/wiki/Alternating_current" title="Alternating current">AC</a> <a href="/wiki/Alternator" title="Alternator">Alternator</a> driven by a <a href="/wiki/Watermill" title="Watermill">watermill</a> was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of <a href="/wiki/Godalming" title="Godalming">Godalming</a>, United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_trains" title="Electric trains">electric trains</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Light_bulbs" title="Light bulbs">light bulbs</a>. In 1890, the founder retired and left running the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm. In 1887, it opened its first office in Japan.</p>

<p>Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert &amp; Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become <a href="/wiki/Siemens-Schuckert" title="Siemens-Schuckert">Siemens-Schuckert</a>. In 1907, Siemens (<a href="/wiki/Siemens_%26_Halske" title="Siemens &amp; Halske">Siemens &amp; Halske</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siemens-Schuckert" title="Siemens-Schuckert">Siemens-Schuckert</a>) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees. (see <a href="/wiki/List_of_German_companies_by_employees_in_1907" title="List of German companies by employees in 1907">List of German companies by employees in 1907</a>)</p>
<p>In 1919, S &amp; H and two other companies jointly formed the <a href="/wiki/Osram" title="Osram">Osram</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lightbulb" title="Lightbulb">lightbulb</a> company.</p>

<p>Siemens (at the time: <a href="/wiki/Siemens-Schuckert" title="Siemens-Schuckert">Siemens-Schuckert</a>) exploited the forced labour of deported people in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extermination_camps" title="Extermination camps">extermination camps</a>. The company owned a plant in <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>.</p>
<p>During the final years of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids. To prevent further losses, manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war. The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods. According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.</p>
<p>In 1972, Siemens sued German satirist F.C. Delius for his satirical history of the company, <i>Unsere Siemenswelt</i>, and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens' history in Nazi Germany. The company supplied electrical parts to <a href="/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps" title="Nazi concentration camps">Nazi concentration camps</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_camps" title="Death camps">death camps</a>. The factories had poor working conditions, where malnutrition and death were common. Also, the scholarship has shown that the camp factories were created, run, and supplied by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SS" title="SS">SS</a>, in conjunction with company officials, sometimes high-level officials.</p>
<p>Siemens businessman and <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Party" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a> member <a href="/wiki/John_Rabe" title="John Rabe">John Rabe</a> is, however, credited with saving many Chinese lives during the infamous <a href="/wiki/Nanking_Massacre" title="Nanking Massacre">Nanking Massacre</a>. He later toured Germany lecturing on the atrocities committed by Japanese forces in Nanking.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Argentine">Argentine</span></h3>
<p>In 2014 a former Siemens executive Andres Truppel pleaded guilty to funneling nearly $100 million in bribes to Argentine government officials to win the ID card project for Siemens. Two months later Siemens agreed to pay a $1.6 billion penalty to US and German authorities to resolve the case.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="European_Union">European Union</span></h3>
<p>In January 2007, Siemens was fined €396 million by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> for <a href="/wiki/Price_fixing" title="Price fixing">price fixing</a> in EU electricity markets through a <a href="/wiki/Cartel" title="Cartel">cartel</a> involving 11 companies, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ABB_Asea_Brown_Boveri" title="ABB Asea Brown Boveri">ABB</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alstom" title="Alstom">Alstom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fuji_Electric" title="Fuji Electric">Fuji Electric</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hitachi_Japan" title="Hitachi Japan">Hitachi Japan</a>, AE Power Systems, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_Electric_Corp" title="Mitsubishi Electric Corp">Mitsubishi Electric Corp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Schneider_Electric" title="Schneider Electric">Schneider</a>, <a href="/wiki/Areva" title="Areva">Areva</a>, <a href="/wiki/Toshiba" title="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> and <a href="/wiki/VA_Tech_Wabag" title="VA Tech Wabag">VA Tech</a>. According to the Commission, "between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information." Siemens was given the highest fine of €396 million, more than half of the total, for its alleged leadership role in the activity.</p>
<p>Siemens agreed to pay a record $1.34 billion in fines in December 2008 after being investigated for bribery. The investigation found questionable payments of roughly €1.3 billion, from 2002 to 2006 that triggered a broad range of inquiries in Germany, the United States and other countries. In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about €6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win <a href="/wiki/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> <a href="/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">turbine</a> supply contracts with <a href="/wiki/Enel" title="Enel">Enel</a>, an Italian energy company.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Greece">Greece</span></h3>
<p>Siemens has been <a href="/wiki/Siemens_Greek_bribery_scandal" title="Siemens Greek bribery scandal">accused of bribing Greek officials</a>. In 2008, it was revealed that Siemens had bribed the two main political parties of <a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> for approximately 10 years to be the sole provider of mechanical and electrical equipment of the Greek state. After the exposure the German authorities moved to arrest the representatives of Siemens in Greece, who had managed to escape from the Greek authorities. The German judicial system didn't allow the Greek authorities to cross-question the representatives. As a result, there wasn't any solid evidence against the corrupt politicians, who weren't arrested and continue to be active in the Greek political system. Meanwhile, the Greek state cancelled the planned business deals. In August 2012, the Greek government signed a settlement with Siemens for these corruption cases worth 330 million euros.</p>

<p>In 2014 Israeli prosecutors decreed that Siemens should pay US$42.7 million penalty and appoint an external inspector to supervise its business in Israel in exchange for state prosecutors dropping charges of securities fraud. According to the indictment, "Siemens systematically paid bribes to Israel Electric Corporation executives so they would utilize their positions in order to favor and advance the interests of Siemens".</p>
