<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>

<p>The term <i>capitalist</i>, meaning an owner of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>, appears earlier than the term <i>capitalism</i>. It dates back to the mid-17th century. <i>Capitalist</i> is derived from <i>capital</i>, which evolved from <i>capitale</i>, a late <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word based on <i>caput</i>, meaning "head" — also the origin of <i><a href="/wiki/Personal_property" title="Personal property">chattel</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">cattle</a></i> in the sense of movable property (only much later to refer only to livestock). Capitale emerged in the 12th to 13th centuries in the sense of referring to funds, stock of merchandise, sum of money, or money carrying interest. By 1283 it was used in the sense of the capital assets of a trading firm. It was frequently interchanged with a number of other words — wealth, money, funds, goods, assets, property, and so on.</p>
<p>The <i>Hollandische Mercurius</i> uses <i>capitalists</i> in 1633 and 1654 to refer to owners of capital. In French, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Clavier" title="Étienne Clavier">Étienne Clavier</a> referred to <i>capitalistes</i> in 1788, six years before its first recorded English usage by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur_Young_(writer)" title="Arthur Young (writer)">Arthur Young</a> in his work <i>Travels in France</i> (1792). <a href="/wiki/David_Ricardo" title="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</a>, in his <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Principles_of_Political_Economy_and_Taxation" title="Principles of Political Economy and Taxation">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</a></i> (1817), referred to "the capitalist" many times. <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, an English poet, used <i>capitalist</i> in his work <i>Table Talk</i> (1823). <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> used the term <i>capitalist</i> in his first work, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/What_is_Property%3F" title="What is Property?">What is Property?</a></i> (1840), to refer to the owners of capital. <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> used the term <i>capitalist</i> in his 1845 work <i><a href="/wiki/Sybil_(novel)" title="Sybil (novel)">Sybil</a></i>.</p>
<p>The initial usage of the term <i>capitalism</i> in its modern sense has been attributed to <a href="/wiki/Louis_Blanc" title="Louis Blanc">Louis Blanc</a> in 1850 ("..what i call 'capitalism' that is to say the appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others") and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1861 ("Economic and social regime in which capital, the source of income, does not generally belong to those who make it work through their labour."). <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> referred to the <i>capitalistic system</i>. and to the capitalist mode of production in <i>Das Kapital</i> (1867). The use of the word "capitalism" in reference to an economic system appears twice in Volume I of <i>Das Kapital</i>, p. 124 (German edition), and in <i>Theories of Surplus Value</i>, tome II, p. 493 (German edition). Marx did not extensively use the form <i>capitalism</i>, but instead those of <i>capitalist</i> and <i>capitalist mode of production</i>, which appear more than 2600 times in the trilogy <i>Das Kapital</i>.</p>
<p>According to the <i><a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> (OED), the term <i>capitalism</i> first appeared in English in 1854 in the novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Newcomes" title="The Newcomes">The Newcomes</a></i>, by novelist <a href="/wiki/William_Makepeace_Thackeray" title="William Makepeace Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>, where he meant "having ownership of capital". Also according to the OED, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carl_Adolph_Douai" title="Carl Adolph Douai">Carl Adolph Douai</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German-American" title="German-American">German-American</a> <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">abolitionist</a>, used the phrase <i>private capitalism</i> in 1863.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_capitalism" title="History of capitalism">History of capitalism</a></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">Capital</a> has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries, in the form of merchant, renting and lending activities, and occasionally as small-scale industry with some wage labour. Simple <a href="/wiki/Commodity" title="Commodity">commodity</a> exchange, and consequently simple commodity production, which are the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. The "capitalistic era" according to Karl Marx dates from 16th century merchants and small urban workshops. Marx knew that wage labour existed on a modest scale for centuries before capitalist industry. Early Islam promulgated capitalist economic policies, which migrated to Europe through trade partners from cities such as Venice. Capitalism in its modern form can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.</p>
<p>Thus for much of history, capital and commercial trade existed, but it did not lead to industrialisation or dominate the production process of society. That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their <a href="/wiki/Labour_power" title="Labour power">labour power</a> for a living, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Legal" title="Legal">legal</a> framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale, and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> countries, although there is plenty of capital and labour. Thus, the obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are less technical and more social, cultural and political.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agrarian_capitalism">Agrarian capitalism</span></h3>
<p>The economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England; the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Manorial_system" title="Manorial system">manorial system</a> had broken down, and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Serf" title="Serf">serf</a>-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the <a href="/wiki/Aristocracy" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> to extract peasant <a href="/wiki/Excess_supply" title="Excess supply">surpluses</a> encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods, in order to flourish in a competitive <a href="/wiki/Labour_economics" title="Labour economics">labor market</a>. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.</p>
<p>By the early 17th-century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medieval_Europe" title="Medieval Europe">Medieval Europe</a> had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and by a disproportionately large capital city, <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. The capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country, creating a very large internal market for goods, contrasting with the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">Continent</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mercantilism">Mercantilism</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Mercantilism" title="Mercantilism">Mercantilism</a></div>

<p>The economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called <a href="/wiki/Mercantilism" title="Mercantilism">mercantilism</a>. This period, the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" title="Age of Discovery">Age of Discovery</a>, was associated with the geographic exploration of the foreign lands by merchant traders, especially from England and the <a href="/wiki/Low_Countries" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>. Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist methods. Most scholars consider the era of merchant capitalism and mercantilism as the origin of modern capitalism, although <a href="/wiki/Karl_Polanyi" title="Karl Polanyi">Karl Polanyi</a> argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he called the "fictitious commodities": land, labor, and money. Accordingly, he argued that "not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date".</p>

<p>England began a large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elizabethan_Era" title="Elizabethan Era">Elizabethan Era</a> (1558–1603). A systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Mun" title="Thomas Mun">Thomas Mun</a>'s argument <i>England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure.</i> It was written in the 1620s and published in 1664.</p>
<p>European <a href="/wiki/Merchant" title="Merchant">merchants</a>, backed by state controls, subsidies, and <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopolies</a>, made most of their profits by buying and selling goods. In the words of <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, the purpose of mercantilism was "the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices ..."</p>
<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company" title="Dutch East India Company">Dutch East India Company</a> inaugurated an expansive era of commerce and trade. These companies were characterized by their <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" title="Colonialism">colonial</a> and <a href="/wiki/Expansionism" title="Expansionism">expansionary</a> powers given to them by nation-states. During this era, merchants, who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a <a href="/wiki/Return_on_investment" title="Return on investment">return on investment</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrial_capitalism">Industrial capitalism</span></h3>

<p>In the mid-18th century, a new group of economic theorists, led by <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, challenged fundamental <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mercantilist" title="Mercantilist">mercantilist</a> doctrines such as the belief that the world's wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, industrialists replaced merchants as a dominant factor in the capitalist system and affected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of <a href="/wiki/Artisan" title="Artisan">artisans</a>, guilds, and <a href="/wiki/Journeyman" title="Journeyman">journeymen</a>. Also during this period, the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture. Industrial capitalism marked the development of the <a href="/wiki/Factory" title="Factory">factory</a> system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Division_of_labor" title="Division of labor">division of labor</a> between and within work process and the routine of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Britain also abandoned its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protectionist" title="Protectionist">protectionist</a> policy, as embraced by mercantilism. In the 19th century, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Cobden" title="Richard Cobden">Richard Cobden</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Bright" title="John Bright">John Bright</a>, who based their beliefs on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Manchester_capitalism" title="Manchester capitalism">Manchester School</a>, initiated a movement to lower tariffs. In the 1840s, Britain adopted a less protectionist policy, with the repeal of the <a href="/wiki/Corn_Laws" title="Corn Laws">Corn Laws</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Navigation_Acts" title="Navigation Acts">Navigation Acts</a>. Britain reduced <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tariffs" title="Tariffs">tariffs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Import_quota" title="Import quota">quotas</a>, in line with David Ricardo's advocacy for <a href="/wiki/Free_trade" title="Free trade">free trade</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_capitalism">Modern capitalism</span></h3>

<p>Capitalism was carried across the world by broader processes of <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a> and, by the end of the 18th century, became the dominant <i>global</i> economic system, in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization. Later, in the 20th century, capitalism overcame a challenge by <a href="/wiki/Planned_economy" title="Planned economy">centrally-planned economies</a> and is now <i>the</i> encompassing system worldwide, with the <a href="/wiki/Mixed_economy" title="Mixed economy">mixed economy</a> being its dominant form in the industrialized Western world.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">Industrialization</a> allowed cheap production of household items using <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a>, while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by 18th-century <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/First_Opium_War" title="First Opium War">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Opium_War" title="Second Opium War">Second Opium Wars</a> and the completion of British conquest of India, vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of European exports. Also in this period, areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system. Meanwhile, the conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, by Europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rubber" title="Rubber">rubber</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diamonds" title="Diamonds">diamonds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and the United States.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea, the various products of the whole earth, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep. Militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper. What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in August 1914.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this period, the global financial system was mainly tied to the <a href="/wiki/Gold_standard" title="Gold standard">gold standard</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> first formally adopted this standard in 1821. Soon to follow were <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Province_of_Canada" title="United Province of Canada">Canada</a> in 1853, <a href="/wiki/History_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="History of Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland</a> in 1865, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and Germany (<i><a href="/wiki/De_jure" title="De jure">de jure</a></i>) in 1873. New technologies, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telegraph" title="Telegraph">telegraph</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable" title="Transatlantic telegraph cable">transatlantic cable</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Radiotelephone" title="Radiotelephone">radiotelephone</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Steamship" title="Steamship">steamship</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Railway" title="Railway">railway</a> allowed goods and information to move around the world at an unprecedented degree.</p>

<p>In the period following the global depression of the 1930s, the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world. The postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the situation was worsened by the rise of <a href="/wiki/Stagflation" title="Stagflation">stagflation</a>. <a href="/wiki/Monetarism" title="Monetarism">Monetarism</a>, a modification of Keynesianism that is more compatible with laissez-faire, gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world, especially under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> in the US and <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in the UK in the 1980s. Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Collectivist" title="Collectivist">collectivist</a> concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called "remarketized capitalism".</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_to_democracy">Relationship to democracy</span></h4>

<p>The relationship between <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and in popular political movements. The extension of universal adult male <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a> in 19th century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism, and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading capitalists to posit a causal or mutual relationship between them. However, in the 20th century, according to some authors, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascist</a> regimes, absolute monarchies, and single-party states. Democratic peace theory asserts that democracies seldom fight other democracies, but critics of that theory suggest that this may be because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or capitalist.</p>
<p>Moderate critics argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democracy in the past, it may not do so in the future, as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Authoritarian" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom.</p>
<p>States with capitalistic economic systems have thrived under political regimes deemed to be authoritarian or oppressive. Singapore has a successful open market economy as a result of its competitive, business-friendly climate and robust rule of law; nonetheless, it often comes under fire for (1) its brand of government, which, though democratic and consistently one of the least corrupt, operates largely under a one-party rule, and (2) not vigorously defending freedom of expression, given its government-regulated press, as well as penchant for upholding laws protecting ethnic and religious harmony, judicial dignity and personal reputation. The private (capitalist) sector in the People's Republic of China has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception, despite having an authoritarian government. <a href="/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet" title="Augusto Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>'s rule in Chile led to economic growth and high levels of inequality by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism. In <i><a href="/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century" title="Capital in the Twenty-First Century">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Piketty" title="Thomas Piketty">Thomas Piketty</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Paris_School_of_Economics" title="Paris School of Economics">Paris School of Economics</a> asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting <a href="/wiki/Wealth_concentration" title="Wealth concentration">concentration of wealth</a> can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built. <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marxists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> (except for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anarcho-capitalists" title="Anarcho-capitalists">anarcho-capitalists</a>), and other leftists argue that capitalism is incompatible with democracy since capitalism according to Marx entails "dictatorship of the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>" (owners of the means of production) while democracy entails rule by the people.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>Capitalism is "production for exchange" driven by the desire for personal accumulation of money receipts in such exchanges, mediated by free markets. The markets themselves are driven by the needs and wants of consumers and those of society as a whole. If these wants and needs were (in the socialist or communist society envisioned by Marx, Engels and others) the driving force, it would be "<a href="/wiki/Production_for_use" title="Production for use">production for use</a>". Contemporary mainstream economics, particularly that associated with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Right_wing_politics" title="Right wing politics">right</a>, holds that an "<a href="/wiki/Invisible_hand" title="Invisible hand">invisible hand</a>", through little more than the freedom of the market, is able to match social production to these needs and desires.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h3>
<p>In general, capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarised by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Capital_accumulation" title="Capital accumulation">Capital accumulation</a>: Production for profit and accumulation as the implicit purpose of all or most of production, constriction or elimination of production formerly carried out on a common social or private household basis.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_market">The market</span></h3>

<p>In free-market and <i><a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a></i> forms of capitalism, markets are used most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism. In mixed economies, which are almost universal today, markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct <a href="/wiki/Market_failure" title="Market failure">market failures</a>, promote <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_welfare" title="Social welfare">social welfare</a>, conserve <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">natural resources</a>, fund <a href="/wiki/Military" title="Military">defense</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Public_safety" title="Public safety">public safety</a> or for other reasons. In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/State_capitalist" title="State capitalist">state capitalist</a> systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/State-owned_enterprises" title="State-owned enterprises">state-owned enterprises</a> or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.</p>
<p>Supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale. Demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price. Prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply, and fall when supply exceeds demand. In theory, the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached.</p>
<p>Competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. In capitalist theory, competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. Without competition, a <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cartel" title="Cartel">cartel</a> may develop. A monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market; the firm can therefore limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and raise prices.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Profit_motive">Profit motive</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Profit_motive" title="Profit motive">profit motive</a> is a theory in capitalism which posits that the ultimate goal of a business is to make money. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit.

<p>In capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently.

In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically in free and competitive markets, maximising profits ensures that resources are not wasted.</p>

<p>The relationship between the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a>, its formal mechanisms, and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hernando_de_Soto_(economist)" title="Hernando de Soto (economist)">Hernando de Soto</a> is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.</p>

<p>In capitalist economics, market competition is the rivalry among sellers trying to achieve such goals as increasing profits, market share, and sales volume by varying the elements of the marketing mix: price, product, distribution, and promotion. Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as "the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favourable terms". It was described by <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" title="The Wealth of Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a></i> (1776) and later economists as allocating productive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Resources" title="Resources">resources</a> to their most highly valued uses and encouraging <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/X-efficiency" title="X-efficiency">efficiency</a>. Smith and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Classical_economist" title="Classical economist">classical economists</a> before <a href="/wiki/Antoine_Augustin_Cournot" title="Antoine Augustin Cournot">Cournot</a> were referring to price and non-price rivalry among producers to sell their goods on best terms by bidding of buyers, not necessarily to a large number of sellers nor to a market in final <a href="/wiki/Economic_equilibrium" title="Economic equilibrium">equilibrium</a>. Competition is widespread throughout the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Market_process" title="Market process">market process</a>. It is a condition where "buyers tend to compete with other buyers, and sellers tend to compete with other sellers". In offering goods for exchange, buyers competitively bid to purchase specific quantities of specific goods which are available, or might be available if sellers were to choose to offer such goods. Similarly, sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market, competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers. Competition results from <a href="/wiki/Scarcity" title="Scarcity">scarcity</a> — there is never enough to satisfy all conceivable human wants — and occurs "when people strive to meet the criteria that are being used to determine who gets what".</p>

<p>In a Marxist analysis of the capitalist economy, the reserve army of labour refers to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unemployed" title="Unemployed">unemployed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Underemployment" title="Underemployment">under-employed</a>. It is synonymous with "industrial reserve army" or "relative surplus population", except that the unemployed can be defined as those actually looking for work and that the relative surplus population also includes people unable to work. The use of the word "army" refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, under the <a href="/wiki/Commanding_heights_of_the_economy" title="Commanding heights of the economy">commanding heights of the economy</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the capitalist era in human history (i.e. before the 1500s), <a href="/wiki/Structural_unemployment" title="Structural unemployment">structural unemployment</a> on a mass scale rarely existed, other than that caused by natural disasters and wars. In ancient societies, all people who could work necessarily had to work, otherwise they would starve; a slave or a serf by definition could not become "unemployed". There was normally very little possibility of "earning a crust" without working at all, and the usual attitude toward beggars and idlers was harsh. Children began to work already at a very early age. Indeed, the word "employment" is linguistically a product of the capitalist era. A permanent level of unemployment presupposes a working population which is to a large extent dependent on a wage or salary for a living, without having other means of livelihood, as well as the right of enterprises to hire and fire employees in accordance with commercial or economic conditions. The expression "unemployed" in English, in the sense of "temporarily out of work", dates back to the 1660s; reference to "the unemployed" as a group was first made in 1782; and reference to "unemployment" as a general condition is first attested in 1888.</p>
<p>The first recorded discussion of the reserve army of labour is in a manuscript written by <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"Big industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of <a href="/wiki/Overproduction" title="Overproduction">overproduction</a>. The main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is, of course, to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible, which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it, i.e., when the overpopulation is the greatest. Overpopulation is therefore in the interest of the bourgeoisie, and it gives the workers good advice which it knows to be impossible to carry out. Since capital only increases when it employs workers, the increase of capital involves an increase of the proletariat, and, as we have seen, according to the nature of the relation of capital and labour, the increase of the proletariat must proceed relatively even faster. The... theory... which is also expressed as a law of nature, that population grows faster than the means of subsistence, is the more welcome to the bourgeois as it silences his conscience, makes hard-heartedness into a moral duty and the consequences of society into the consequences of nature, and finally gives him the opportunity to watch the destruction of the proletariat by starvation as calmly as other natural event without bestirring himself, and, on the other hand, to regard the misery of the proletariat as its own fault and to punish it. To be sure, the proletarian can restrain his natural instinct by reason, and so, by moral supervision, halt the law of nature in its injurious course of development." - Karl Marx, <i><a href="/wiki/Wage_Labour_and_Capital" title="Wage Labour and Capital">Wages</a></i>, December 1847</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marx introduced the concept in chapter 25 of the first volume of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Das_Kapital" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a></i>, which states:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"capitalistic accumulation itself... constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant population of workers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the <a href="/wiki/Valorisation" title="Valorisation">valorisation</a> of capital, and therefore a surplus-population... It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about the same... The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the accumulation of capital."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His argument is that as capitalism develops, the <a href="/wiki/Organic_composition_of_capital" title="Organic composition of capital">organic composition of capital</a> will increase, which means that the mass of <a href="/wiki/Constant_capital" title="Constant capital">constant capital</a> grows faster than the mass of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Variable_capital" title="Variable capital">variable capital</a>. Fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for society's requirements. In addition, capital will become more concentrated and centralised in fewer hands. This being the <i>absolute</i> historical tendency, part of the working population will tend to become <i>surplus</i> to the requirements of <a href="/wiki/Capital_accumulation" title="Capital accumulation">capital accumulation</a> over time. Paradoxically, the larger the wealth of society, the larger the industrial reserve army will become. Marx called it "the antagonism of capital accumulation" and he cites his <i><a href="/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Philosophy" title="The Poverty of Philosophy">The Poverty of Philosophy</a></i>, (Chapter 2, Section 1) to explain this phenomenon in relation with <a href="/wiki/Relations_of_production" title="Relations of production">relations of production</a>. One could add that the larger the wealth of society, the more people it can support who do not work. However, as Marx develops the argument further, it also becomes clear that, depending on the state of the economy, the reserve army of labour will either expand or contract, alternately being absorbed or expelled from the employed workforce. Thus,</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"Taking them as a whole, the general movements of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wages" title="Wages">wages</a> are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army, and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle. They are, therefore, not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population, but by the varying proportions in which the working-class is divided into active and reserve army, by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus-population, by the extent to which it is now absorbed, now set free."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, there has been growing research on the concept of "the <a href="/wiki/Precariat" title="Precariat">precariat</a>", to describe a growing reliance on temporary, part-time workers with precarious status, who share aspects of the proletariat and the reserve army of labor. Precarious workers do work part-time or full-time in temporary jobs, but they cannot really earn enough to live on, and depend partly on friends or family, or on state benefits, to survive. Typically they do not become truly "unemployed", but they don't have a stable job to go to either. The rise of "the precariat" has been attributed to the emergence of global <a href="/wiki/Neoliberalism" title="Neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>.</p>
<p>Although non-employed people who are unable or uninterested in performing legal paid work are not considered among the "unemployed", the concept of "conjunctural unemployment" is used in economics nowadays. Economists often distinguish between short-term "frictional" or "cyclical" unemployment, and longer-term "structural unemployment". Sometimes there is a short-term mismatch between the demand and supply of labour, at other times there is much less total demand for labour than supply for a long-time. If no possibility for getting a job at all in the foreseeable future exists, many younger people decide to migrate or emigrate to a place where they can find work.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Composition_of_the_relative_surplus_population">Composition of the relative surplus population</span></h4>
<p>Marx discusses the army of labor and the reserve army in Capital, Ch. 25, Section IV. The Army of Labor consists in those working-class people employed in average or better than average jobs. Not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs. There are then four other categories where members of the working class might find themselves: the "stagnant pool", the <i>floating reserves</i>, the <i>latent reserve,</i> and pauperdom. Finally, people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality, and Marx refers to such people as "lumpenproletariat."</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>stagnant</i> part consists of marginalised people with "extremely irregular employment". Stagnant pool jobs are characterized by below average pay, dangerous working conditions, they may be temporary. Those caught in the stagnant pool have jobs, so the modern definition of the employed would include both the army of labor plus the stagnant pool. However, they are constantly on the lookout for something better.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modern unemployed would refer primarily to the <i>floating reserve,</i> people who used to have good jobs, but are now out of work. They certainly hope that their unemployment is temporary ("conjunctural unemployment"), but they are well aware that they could fall into the stagnant pool or the pauper class.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>latent</i> part consists of that segment of the population not yet fully integrated into capitalist production. In Marx' day, he was referring to people living off of subsistence agriculture who were looking for monetary employment in industry. In modern times, people coming from slums in developing countries where they survive largely by non-monetary means, to developed cities where they work for pay might form the latent. Housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve. They are not unemployed, because they are not necessarily actively looking for a job; but if capital needs extra workers, it can pull them out of the latent reserve. In this sense, the latent forms a reservoir of potential workers for industries.</li>
<li>Pauperdom is where one might end up. The homeless is the modern term for paupers. Marx calls them people who cannot adapt to capital's never ending change. For Karl Marx, "the sphere of pauperism", including those still able to work, orphans and pauper children, and the "demoralised and ragged" or "unable to work".</li>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Mode_of_production" title="Mode of production">Mode of production</a></div>
<p>In Karl Marx' critique of political economy and subsequent Marxian analyses, the <b>capitalist mode of production</b> refers to the systems of organising production and distribution within capitalist <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">societies</a>. Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit, etc.) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper, based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production, and on industrial technology, began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a>, later extending to most of the world.</p>
<p>The term capitalist mode of production is defined by <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property">private ownership</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>, extraction of <a href="/wiki/Surplus_value" title="Surplus value">surplus value</a> by the owning class for the purpose of <a href="/wiki/Capital_accumulation" title="Capital accumulation">capital accumulation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wage_labour" title="Wage labour">wage-based labour</a>, and, at least as far as <a href="/wiki/Commodity" title="Commodity">commodities</a> are concerned, being <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market-based</a>.</p>
<p>“Capitalism” in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in <a href="/wiki/Simple_commodity_production" title="Simple commodity production">simple commodity production</a> (hence the reference to “<a href="/wiki/Merchant_capitalism" title="Merchant capitalism">merchant capitalism</a>”) since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the “capitalist mode of production” is that most of the inputs and outputs of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Production,_costs,_and_pricing" title="Production, costs, and pricing">production</a> are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode. For example, in flourishing Feudalism, most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade. This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is <i>reshaped and re-organised</i> to conform with economic <a href="/wiki/Bounded_rationality" title="Bounded rationality">rationality as bounded</a> by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales, profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall. That is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to “commercial logic”. Essentially, capital accumulation comes to define economic rationality in capitalist production.</p>
<p>A society, region or <a href="/wiki/Nation" title="Nation">nation</a> is “capitalist” if the predominant source of incomes and products being distributed is capitalist activity; even so, this does not yet mean necessarily that the capitalist mode of production is dominant in that society.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h3>
<p>The most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or "full-time", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker), in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms, and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Employment status</i>: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time <a href="/wiki/Self-employment" title="Self-employment">self-employment</a>. The worker could be employed also as an <a href="/wiki/Apprenticeship" title="Apprenticeship">apprentice</a>.</li>
<li><i>Civil (legal) status</i>: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indentured_labour" title="Indentured labour">indentured labourer</a>, the subject of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Forced_labour" title="Forced labour">forced labour</a> (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">semi-slave</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Serfdom" title="Serfdom">serf</a> bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.</li>
<li><i>Method of payment (remuneration or <a href="/wiki/Compensation_of_employees" title="Compensation of employees">compensation</a>)</i>. The work done could be paid "in cash" (a money-wage) or "in kind" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Piecework" title="Piecework">piece rates</a>" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of <a href="/wiki/Employee_stock_option" title="Employee stock option">stock options</a> or <a href="/wiki/Share_(finance)" title="Share (finance)">shares</a> in an enterprise.</li>
<li><i>Method of hiring</i>: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. But he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subcontracting" title="Subcontracting">subcontracted</a> several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise <i>together</i> with <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a>.</li>

<p>Wage labour has long been compared to slavery. As a result, the phrase <a href="/wiki/Labour_economics#Wage_slavery" title="Labour economics">“wage slavery”</a> is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labour. Similarly, advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital", and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually <i>worse</i> than <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chattel_slavery" title="Chattel slavery">chattel slavery</a>. Slavery apologists like <a href="/wiki/George_Fitzhugh" title="George Fitzhugh">George Fitzhugh</a> contended that workers only accepted wage labour with the passage of time, as they became "familiarised and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale". Scholars have debated the exact relationship between wage labor, slavery, and capitalism at length, especially for the antebellum United States.</p>
<p>Similarities between wage labour and slavery were noted as early as <a href="/wiki/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> in Ancient Rome. With the advent of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a>, thinkers such as <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Proudhon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a> elaborated the comparison between wage labour and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use, while <a href="/wiki/Luddite" title="Luddite">Luddites</a> emphasised the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dehumanisation" title="Dehumanisation">dehumanisation</a> brought about by machines. Before the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, Southern defenders of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/African_American" title="African American">African American</a> slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North. The United States abolished slavery during the Civil War, but labor union activists found the metaphor useful. According to <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_B._Glickman" title="Lawrence B. Glickman">Lawrence Glickman</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Gilded_Age" title="Gilded Age">Gilded Age</a>, "References abounded in the labor press, and it is hard to find a speech by a labour leader without the phrase."</p>

Both the <a href="/wiki/Milgram_experiment" title="Milgram experiment">Milgram</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stanford_experiment" title="Stanford experiment">Stanford experiments</a> have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations. Additionally, as per anthropologist <a href="/wiki/David_Graeber" title="David Graeber">David Graeber</a>, the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money, and the slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.) Such arrangements, according to Graeber, were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil. <a href="/wiki/C._L._R._James" title="C. L. R. James">C. L. R.

<p><a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The interest of the dealers... in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public… [They] have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public… We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate… It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms.</p>

<p>For Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labour, provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism. "It can be persuasively argued", noted one concerned philosopher, "that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it." That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx' conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a <i>class dependent on wages</i>, the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!"</p>

<p>Market failure occurs when an <a href="/wiki/Externality" title="Externality">externality</a> is present and a market will often either under-produce a product with a positive externalisation or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalisation. Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externalisation that cannot be easily incorporated into markets as the world's air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters. So, too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution.

<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Accumulation_of_capital" title="Accumulation of capital">accumulation of capital</a> refers to the process of "making money", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based around the accumulation of capital, whereby <a href="/wiki/Financial_capital" title="Financial capital">financial capital</a> is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_value" title="Law of value">law of value</a>. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>, defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit. In this context, "capital" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Accounting" title="Accounting">accounting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian economics</a>, capital accumulation is often equated with <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> of profit income or savings, especially in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Real_vs._nominal_in_economics" title="Real vs. nominal in economics">real</a> capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset <a href="/wiki/Value_(economics)" title="Value (economics)">value</a> in search of additional value or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-value" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a>. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in <a href="/wiki/Confiscation" title="Confiscation">expropriation</a>, both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or "trading up" but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else, without compensation. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/David_Harvey_(geographer)" title="David Harvey (geographer)">David Harvey</a> calls this <a href="/wiki/Accumulation_by_dispossession" title="Accumulation by dispossession">accumulation by dispossession</a>.</p>
<p>The continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade, and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital, because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. But capital accumulation may also confront resistance, when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" title="Strike action">strike</a> by investors or workers, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consumer_resistance" title="Consumer resistance">consumer resistance</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Concentration_and_centralisation">Concentration and centralisation</span></h3>
<p>According to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralisation in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains:</p>
<p>"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals.... Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many.... The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, <i>caeteris paribus</i>, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages.... It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish."</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_rate_of_accumulation">The rate of accumulation</span></h3>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian economics</a>, the <i>rate of accumulation</i> is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the <a href="/wiki/Stock_and_flow" title="Stock and flow">stock</a> of capital in an accounting period, (2) the proportion of realised <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-value" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a> or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (see, e.g., the writings of the economist <a href="/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Kalecki" title="Michał Kalecki">Michał Kalecki</a>).</p>
<p>Other things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about "how much to spend, and how much to save".</p>
<p>In a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_force" title="Labor force">labor force</a>, and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.</p>
<p>In a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation, and luxury consumption. In that case, income from <a href="/wiki/Value_added" title="Value added">value-adding</a> production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true, and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ernest_Mandel" title="Ernest Mandel">Ernest Mandel</a> emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Necessary_product" title="Necessary product">necessary product</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Surplus_product" title="Surplus product">surplus product</a>", and (2) the division of the surplus product between <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Consumption_(economics)" title="Consumption (economics)">consumption</a>. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of <a href="/wiki/Competition" title="Competition">competition</a> among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers, and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors, it also involved social factors and <a href="/wiki/Economic_power" title="Economic power">power</a> relationships.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_circuit_of_capital_accumulation_from_production">The circuit of capital accumulation from production</span></h3>

<p>Strictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised <a href="/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" title="Profit (accounting)">profit</a> income has been <i>reinvested</i> in capital assets. But the process of capital accumulation in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Production,_costs,_and_pricing" title="Production, costs, and pricing">production</a> has, as suggested in the first volume of Marx' <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Das_Kapital" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a></i>, at least 7 distinct but linked moments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial investment of <a href="/wiki/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a> (which could be borrowed capital) in <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_power" title="Labor power">labor power</a>.</li>
<li>The command over <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-labour" title="Surplus-labour">surplus-labour</a> and its appropriation.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Valorisation" title="Valorisation">valorisation</a> (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.</li>
<li>The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.</li>
<li>The realisation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus-value" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a> through output sales.</li>
<li>The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.</li>
<li>The reinvestment of profit income in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these moments do not refer simply to an "economic" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Simple_and_expanded_reproduction">Simple and expanded reproduction</span></h3>

<p>In volume 2 of <i>Das Kapital</i>, Marx continues the story and shows that, with the aid of bank <a href="/wiki/Credit_(finance)" title="Credit (finance)">credit</a>, capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities, etc.), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate etc.), or production capital (<a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> and labor power).</p>
<p>His discussion of the simple and expanded <a href="/wiki/Reproduction_(economics)" title="Reproduction (economics)">reproduction</a> of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Living_standard" title="Living standard">living standard</a>; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, <i>more</i> product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a <a href="/wiki/Surplus_product" title="Surplus product">surplus product</a>); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.</p>
<p>The bourgeois claim there is no <a href="/wiki/Economic_law" title="Economic law">economic law</a> according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in Vol. 2, simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1 — producers of means of production — exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (pg 524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (pg. 514).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ernest_Mandel" title="Ernest Mandel">Ernest Mandel</a> introduced the additional concept of <i>contracted economic reproduction</i>, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de<a href="/wiki/Valorisation" title="Valorisation">valorisation</a>.</p>
<p>Balanced <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a> requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. But markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance, in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a>: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and <a href="/wiki/Protectionism" title="Protectionism">protectionism</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Capital_accumulation_as_social_relation">Capital accumulation as social relation</span></h3>
<p>"Accumulation of capital" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_relations" title="Social relations">social relations</a> (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e., the expansion of the size of the <a href="/wiki/Proletariat" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a> and of the wealth owned by the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>.</p>
<p>This interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> (a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_accumulation" title="Law of accumulation">law of accumulation</a>"). In the first volume of <i>Das Kapital</i> Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to <a href="/wiki/Edward_Gibbon_Wakefield" title="Edward Gibbon Wakefield">Edward Gibbon Wakefield</a>'s theory of colonisation:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"...Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative — the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to <a href="/wiki/Swan_River_(Western_Australia)" title="Swan River (Western Australia)">Swan River</a>, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £50,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, “Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.” Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Capital,_Volume_III" title="Capital, Volume III">the third volume</a> of <i>Das Kapital</i>, Marx refers to the "fetishism of capital" reaching its highest point with <i>interest-bearing capital</i>, because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything.

<p>The four basic laws of <a href="/wiki/Supply_(economics)" title="Supply (economics)">supply</a> and <a href="/wiki/Demand" title="Demand">demand</a> are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.</li>
<li>If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.</li>
<li>If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.</li>
<li>If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Graphical_representation_of_supply_and_demand">Graphical representation of supply and demand</span></h3>
<p>Although it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as <a href="/wiki/Function_(mathematics)" title="Function (mathematics)">functions</a> of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Marshall" title="Alfred Marshall">Alfred Marshall</a>, has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.</p>
<p>Since determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as "shifts" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supply_schedule">Supply schedule</span></h4>
<p>A supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of <a href="/wiki/Perfect_competition" title="Perfect competition">perfect competition</a>, supply is determined by <a href="/wiki/Marginal_cost" title="Marginal cost">marginal cost</a>. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.</p>
<p>A hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply, shifting costs up, while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.</p>
<p>By its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question "If this firm is <i>faced with</i> this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?" If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not "faced with" any price, and the question becomes less relevant.</p>
<p>Economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and between the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price. Thus, in the graph of the supply curve, individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.</p>
<p>Economists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically <a href="/wiki/Physical_capital" title="Physical capital">physical capital</a>), and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can <a href="/wiki/Market_entry_strategy" title="Market entry strategy">enter</a> or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.</p>
<p>The determinants of supply are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production, and/or technological advances. See: <a href="/wiki/Productivity" title="Productivity">Productivity</a>.</li>
<li>Firms' expectations about future prices.</li>
<li>Number of suppliers.</li>
</ol>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Demand_schedule">Demand schedule</span></h4>
<p>A demand schedule, depicted graphically as the <a href="/wiki/Demand_curve" title="Demand curve">demand curve</a>, represents the amount of some <a href="/wiki/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a> that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of <a href="/wiki/Substitute_good" title="Substitute good">substitute goods</a>, and the price of <a href="/wiki/Complementary_good" title="Complementary good">complementary goods</a>, remain the same. Following the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_demand" title="Law of demand">law of demand</a>, the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.</p>
<p>Just like the supply curves reflect <a href="/wiki/Marginal_cost" title="Marginal cost">marginal cost</a> curves, demand curves are determined by <a href="/wiki/Marginal_utility" title="Marginal utility">marginal utility</a> curves. Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the <a href="/wiki/Opportunity_cost" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a> determined by the price, that is the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the <i>willingness</i> and <i>ability</i> of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are <a href="/wiki/Giffen_good" title="Giffen good">Giffen goods</a> (an inferior but <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple</a> good) and <a href="/wiki/Veblen_good" title="Veblen good">Veblen goods</a> (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).</p>
<p>By its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor—that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question "If this buyer is <i>faced with</i> this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?" If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not "faced with" any price, and the question is meaningless.</p>
<p>Like with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price. Thus, in the graph of the demand curve, individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.</p>
<p>The determinants of demand are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Income.</li>
<li>Tastes &amp; preferences.</li>
<li>Prices of related goods and services.</li>
<li>Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.</li>
<li>Number of potential consumers.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Equilibrium">Equilibrium</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Further information: <a href="/wiki/Economic_equilibrium" title="Economic equilibrium">Economic equilibrium</a></div>
<p>In the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a> are balanced and in the absence of external influences the (<a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equilibrium" title="wikt:equilibrium">equilibrium</a>) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of <a href="/wiki/Perfect_competition" title="Perfect competition">perfect competition</a>, equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal. <b>Market equilibrium</b> in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_supply_and_demand" title="Law of supply and demand">buyers</a> is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Law_of_supply_and_demand" title="Law of supply and demand">sellers</a>. This price is often called the <b>competitive price</b> or <a href="/wiki/Market_clearing" title="Market clearing">market clearing</a> price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called "competitive quantity" or market clearing quantity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Partial_equilibrium">Partial equilibrium</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Partial_equilibrium" title="Partial equilibrium">Partial equilibrium</a></div>
<p>Partial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.</p>
<p>Jain proposes (attributed to <a href="/wiki/George_Stigler" title="George Stigler">George Stigler</a>): "A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis."</p>
<p>The supply-and-demand model is a <b>partial equilibrium</b> model of <a href="/wiki/Economic_equilibrium" title="Economic equilibrium">economic equilibrium</a>, where the clearance on the <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">market</a> of some specific <a href="/wiki/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a> is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all <a href="/wiki/Substitute_good" title="Substitute good">substitutes</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Complement_good" title="Complement good">complements</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Income" title="Income">income</a> levels of <a href="/wiki/Consumer" title="Consumer">consumers</a> are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_equilibrium" title="General equilibrium">general equilibrium</a> model which includes an entire economy.</p>
<p>Here the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study <a href="/wiki/Economic_equilibrium" title="Economic equilibrium">equilibrium</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pareto_Efficiency" title="Pareto Efficiency">efficiency</a> and <a href="/wiki/Comparative_statics" title="Comparative statics">comparative statics</a>. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but may produce results which, while seemingly precise, do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.</p>
<p>Partial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.</p>
<p>Hence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Walras" title="Léon Walras">Léon Walras</a> first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist <a href="/wiki/Antoine_Augustin_Cournot" title="Antoine Augustin Cournot">Antoine Augustin Cournot</a> and English political economist <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Marshall" title="Alfred Marshall">Alfred Marshall</a> who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Empirical_estimation">Empirical estimation</span></h3>
<p>Demand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity, and other <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a> with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with <i><a href="/wiki/System_of_linear_equations" title="System of linear equations">simultaneous-equation</a> methods of estimation</i> in <a href="/wiki/Econometrics" title="Econometrics">econometrics</a>. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant "structural coefficients", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Identification_(parameter)" title="Identification (parameter)">parameter identification problem</a></i> is a common issue in "structural estimation". Typically, data on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exogenous" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a> variables (that is: variables other than price and quantity, both of which are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Endogeneity_(economics)" title="Endogeneity (economics)">endogenous</a> variables) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to "structural estimation" is <a href="/wiki/Reduced_form" title="Reduced form">reduced-form</a> estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Macroeconomic_uses_of_demand_and_supply">Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply</span></h3>
<p>Demand and supply have also been generalised to explain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macroeconomic" title="Macroeconomic">macroeconomic</a> variables in a <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market economy</a>, including the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Real_GDP" title="Real GDP">quantity of total output</a> and the general <a href="/wiki/Price_level" title="Price level">price level</a>. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AD-AS_model" title="AD-AS model">Aggregate Demand – Aggregate Supply model</a> may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microeconomic" title="Microeconomic">microeconomic</a> uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macroeconomic" title="Macroeconomic">macroeconomic</a> counterparts as <a href="/wiki/Aggregate_demand" title="Aggregate demand">aggregate demand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aggregate_supply" title="Aggregate supply">aggregate supply</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History_2">History</span></h3>
<p>According to Hamid S. Hosseini, the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century <a href="/wiki/Mamluk" title="Mamluk">Mamluk</a> scholar <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah" title="Ibn Taymiyyah">Ibn Taymiyyah</a>, who wrote: "If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down."</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>'s 1691 work <i>Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money</i>. includes an early and clear description of supply and demand and their relationship. In this description demand is <a href="/wiki/Economic_rent" title="Economic rent">rent</a>: “The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers” and “that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.”</p>
<p>The phrase "supply and demand" was first used by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Denham-Steuart" title="James Denham-Steuart">James Denham-Steuart</a> in his <i>Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy</i>, published in 1767. <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> used the phrase in his 1776 book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" title="The Wealth of Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/David_Ricardo" title="David Ricardo">David Ricardo</a> titled one chapter of his 1817 work <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Principles_of_Political_Economy_and_Taxation" title="Principles of Political Economy and Taxation">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</a></i> "On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price".</p>
<p>In <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Smith generally assumed that the supply price was fixed but that its "merit" (value) would decrease as its "scarcity" increased, in effect what was later called the law of demand also. Ricardo, in <i>Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</i>, more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. <a href="/wiki/Antoine_Augustin_Cournot" title="Antoine Augustin Cournot">Antoine Augustin Cournot</a> first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 <i>Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth</i>, including diagrams.</p>
<p>During the late 19th century the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by <a href="/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons" title="William Stanley Jevons">Stanley Jevons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carl_Menger" title="Carl Menger">Carl Menger</a>, and <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Walras" title="Léon Walras">Léon Walras</a>. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price, that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.</p>
<p>In his 1870 essay "On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand", <a href="/wiki/Fleeming_Jenkin" title="Fleeming Jenkin">Fleeming Jenkin</a> in the course of "introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein, including <a href="/wiki/Comparative_statics" title="Comparative statics">comparative statics</a> from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market. The model was further developed and popularized by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Marshall" title="Alfred Marshall">Alfred Marshall</a> in the 1890 textbook <i><a href="/wiki/Principles_of_Economics_(Marshall)" title="Principles of Economics (Marshall)">Principles of Economics</a></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Capitalism_and_war">Capitalism and war</span></h2>
<p>War typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real <a href="/wiki/War_profiteering" title="War profiteering">war profiteering</a>.</p>
<p>The total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.</p>

<p>War destruction can be illustrated by looking at <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant &amp; equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks, etc. were built and then lost or destroyed.</p>
<p>Germany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.</p>
<p>However, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.</p>
<p>Initially, in May 1945, newly installed United States president <a href="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant &amp; equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the USSR. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level, and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.</p>
<p>The first big strike-wave in the Ruhr occurred in early 1947 — it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. The United States appointed military governor (Newman) however stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was: "no work, no eat". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with Marshal Plan aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marshall_Aid" title="Marshall Aid">Marshall Aid</a> funds were important, but, after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system, much more important was the commitment of the United States to <i>rebuilding</i> German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average real wages remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s, while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_economic_miracle" title="German economic miracle">German economic miracle</a> or <i>"Wirtschaftswunder"</i>.</p>
<p>In Italy, the victorious Allies did three things in 1945: they imposed their absolute military authority; they quickly disarmed the Italian partisans from a very large stock of weapons; and they agreed to a state guarantee of wage payments, as well as a veto on all sackings of workers from their jobs. Although the Italian Communist Party grew very large immediately after the war ended — it achieved a membership of 1.7 million people in a population of 45 million — it was outmaneouvred through a complicated political battle by the Christian Democrats, after three years. In the 1950s, an economic boom began in Italy, at first fuelled by internal demand, and then also by exports.</p>
<p>In modern times, it has often been possible to rebuild physical capital assets destroyed in wars completely within the space of about 10 years, except in cases of severe pollution by <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">chemical warfare</a> or other kinds of irreparable devastation. However, damage to <a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a> has been much more devastating, in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_capitalism">Types of capitalism</span></h2>
<p>There are many variants of capitalism in existence that differ according to country and region. They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources, and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. The major forms of capitalism are listed hereafter:</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Advanced_capitalism">Advanced capitalism</span></h3>
<p><b>Advanced capitalism</b> is the situation that pertains to a society in which the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capitalist_model" title="Capitalist model">capitalist model</a> has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci" title="Antonio Gramsci">Antonio Gramsci</a> as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century. At the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power, replaced by use of <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" title="Civil society">civil society</a> institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists' favour.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas" title="Jürgen Habermas">Jürgen Habermas</a> has been a major contributor to the analysis of advanced-capitalistic societies. Habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms</li>
<li>Constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system</li>
<li>A formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system</li>
<li>The use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force</li>
</ul>

<p>In their critique of capitalism, <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leninism" title="Leninism">Leninism</a> both emphasise the role of "<a href="/wiki/Finance_capitalism" title="Finance capitalism">Finance Capital</a>" as the determining and ruling class interest in capitalist society, particularly in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crisis_of_capitalism" title="Crisis of capitalism">latter stages</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Hilferding" title="Rudolf Hilferding">Rudolf Hilferding</a> is credited with first bringing the term finance capitalism into prominence, with his 1910 study of the links between German trusts, banks, and monopolies before <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> – a study subsumed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lenin" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> into his wartime analysis of the imperialist relations of the great world powers. Lenin concluded of the banks at that time that they were “the chief nerve centres of the whole capitalist system of national economy”: for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comintern" title="Comintern">Comintern</a>, the phrase "dictatorship of finance capitalism" became a regular one.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Braudel" title="Braudel">Braudel</a> would later point to two earlier periods when finance capitalism had emerged in human history – with the Genoese in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries – although at those points it was from commercial capitalism that it developed. <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Arrighi" title="Giovanni Arrighi">Giovanni Arrighi</a> extended Braudel's analysis to suggest that a predominance of finance capitalism is a recurring, long-term phenomenon, whenever a previous phase of commercial/industrial capitalist expansion reaches a plateau.</p>

<p>Mercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism, and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e. g. Britain, Portugal, France). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations; it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the <a href="/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital" title="Primitive accumulation of capital">Primitive accumulation of capital</a>.</p>

<p>Free-market economy refers to a capitalist economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of productive enterprises. <i>Laissez-faire</i> is a more extensive form of free-market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting <a href="/wiki/Property_rights_(economics)" title="Property rights (economics)">property rights</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/State_capitalism" title="State capitalism">State capitalism</a> is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the <a href="/wiki/East_Asian_model_of_capitalism" title="East Asian model of capitalism">East Asian model of capitalism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dirigisme" title="Dirigisme">dirigisme</a> and the economy of Norway. Alternatively, <a href="/wiki/Merriam-Webster" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a> defines state capitalism as "an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control".</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>, in <i>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</i>, argued that state-owned enterprises would characterize the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the <a href="/wiki/Capitalist_state" title="Capitalist state">bourgeois state</a>. In his writings, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> characterized the economy of Soviet Russia as state capitalist, believing state capitalism to be an early step toward the development of socialism.</p>
<p>Some economists and left-wing academics including <a href="/wiki/Richard_D._Wolff" title="Richard D. Wolff">Richard D. Wolff</a> and <a href="/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> argue that the economies of the former <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and Eastern bloc represented a form of state capitalism because their internal organization within enterprises and the system of wage labor remained intact.</p>
<p>The term is not used by Austrian school economists to describe state ownership of the means of production. The economist Ludwig von Mises argued that the designation of "state capitalism" was simply a new label for the old labels of "state socialism" and "planned economy", and differed only in non-essentials from these earlier designations.</p>
<p>The debate between proponents of private versus state capitalism is centered around questions of managerial efficacy, productive efficiency, and fair distribution of wealth.</p>

<p>In a capitalist system, the government does not prohibit private property or prevent individuals from working where they please. The government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. Many countries, however, have <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a> laws and minimum safety standards.</p>
<p>Under some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have <a href="/wiki/Competition_law" title="Competition law">competition laws</a> that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market, and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced. In many countries, public utilities (e.g. electricity, heating fuel, communications) are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation, due to high economies of scale.</p>
<p>Government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment.</p>

<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Labor_history_(discipline)" title="Labor history (discipline)">labor historians</a> and scholars have argued that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Unfree_labor" title="Unfree labor">unfree labor</a> — by <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slaves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indentured_servant" title="Indentured servant">indentured servants</a>, prisoners or other coerced persons — is compatible with capitalist relations. <a href="/wiki/Tom_Brass" title="Tom Brass">Tom Brass</a> argued that unfree labor is acceptable to capital. Historian <a href="/wiki/Greg_Grandin" title="Greg Grandin">Greg Grandin</a> argues that capitalism has its origins in slavery: "when historians talk about the Atlantic market revolution, they are talking about capitalism. And when they are talking about capitalism, they are talking about slavery." Historian <a href="/wiki/Edward_E._Baptist" title="Edward E. Baptist">Edward E.

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Wallerstein" title="Immanuel Wallerstein">Immanuel Wallerstein</a>, institutional racism has been "one of the most significant pillars" of the capitalist system and serves as "the ideological justification for the hierarchization of the work-force and its highly unequal distributions of reward".</p>
<p>Many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the <a href="/wiki/Anti-globalization_movement" title="Anti-globalization movement">anti-globalization movement</a>, which is primarily opposed to <a href="/wiki/Corporate_capitalism" title="Corporate capitalism">corporate capitalism</a>. <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">Environmentalists</a> have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth, and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of Earth and cause <a href="/wiki/Holocene_extinction" title="Holocene extinction">mass extinctions</a> of animal and plant life.

<p>Many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism.

Some Christians have criticized capitalism for its <a href="/wiki/Economic_materialism" title="Economic materialism">materialist</a> aspects and its inability to account for the wellbeing of all people. Many of Jesus' parables deal with economic concerns: farming, shepherding, being in debt, doing hard labor, being excluded from banquets and the houses of the rich, and have implications for wealth and power distribution. Catholic scholars and clergy have often criticized capitalism because of its disenfranchisement of the poor often promoting <a href="/wiki/Distributism" title="Distributism">distributism</a> as an alternative. In his 84-page <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_exhortation" title="Apostolic exhortation">apostolic exhortation</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Evangelii_gaudium" title="Evangelii gaudium">Evangelii gaudium</a>,</i> <a href="/wiki/Pope" title="Pope">catholic pope</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pope_Francisco" title="Pope Francisco">Francisco</a> described unfettered capitalism as "a new tyranny" and called on world leaders to fight rising poverty and inequality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people continue to defend <a href="/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" title="Trickle-down economics">trickle-down theories</a> which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proponents of capitalism argue that it creates more prosperity than any other economic system, and that its benefits are mainly to the ordinary person. Critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability, an inability to provide for the well-being of all people, and an unsustainable danger to the natural environment. <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">Socialists</a> maintain that, although capitalism is superior to all previously existing economic systems (such as feudalism or slavery), the contradiction between class interests will only be resolved by advancing into a completely new social system of production and distribution in which all persons have an equal relationship to the means of production.</p>
<p>The term <i>capitalism</i>, in its modern sense, is often attributed to <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. In his <a href="/wiki/Masterpiece" title="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a> <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Das_Kapital" title="Das Kapital">Capital</a></i>, Marx analysed the "<a href="/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory)" title="Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)">capitalist mode of production</a>" using a method of understanding today known as <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>. However, Marx himself rarely used the term "capitalism", while it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work, primarily authored by his collaborator <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>. In the 20th century, defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term <i>capitalism</i> with phrases such as <i>free enterprise</i> and <i>private enterprise</i> and replaced <i>capitalist</i> with <i><a href="/wiki/Rentier_capitalism" title="Rentier capitalism">rentier</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Investor" title="Investor">investor</a></i> in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Profit_motive_2">Profit motive</span></h3>
<p>The majority of criticisms against the profit motive centre on the idea that profits should not supersede the needs of people. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Moore" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>'s film <i><a href="/wiki/Sicko" title="Sicko">Sicko</a></i>, for example, attacks the healthcare industry for its alleged emphasis on profits at the expense of patients. Moore explains:</p>

<p>Another common criticism of the profit motive is that it is believed to encourage selfishness and greed. Critics of the profit motive contend that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">Free-market</a> economists counter that the profit motive, coupled with competition, actually reduces the final price of an item for consumption, rather than raising it. They argue that businesses profit by selling a good at a lower price and at a greater volume than the competition. Economist <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Sowell" title="Thomas Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a> uses supermarkets as an example to illustrate this point: “It has been estimated that a supermarket makes a clear profit of about a penny on a dollar of sales. If that sounds pretty skimpy, remember that it is collecting that penny on every dollar at several cash registers simultaneously and, in many cases, around the clock.”</p>
<p>Economist <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> has argued that greed and self-interest are universal human traits. On a 1979 episode of <a href="/wiki/The_Phil_Donahue_Show" title="The Phil Donahue Show">The Phil Donahue Show</a>, Friedman states: “The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests.” He continues by explaining that only in capitalist countries, where individuals can pursue their own self-interest, people have been able to escape from “grinding poverty”.</p>

<div class="hatnote" role="note">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian economics</a></div>

<p>Marx considered capitalism to be a historically specific <a href="/wiki/Mode_of_production" title="Mode of production">mode of production</a> (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_relations_of_production" title="Social relations of production">social relations</a> between individuals based on their connection with the process of production).</p>
<p>The capitalist stage of development or "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bourgeois" title="Bourgeois">bourgeois</a> society", for Marx, represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> or <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communist</a> transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist, and finally working class rule was reached.</p>
<p>Following <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, Marx distinguished the <a href="/wiki/Use_value" title="Use value">use value</a> of commodities from their <a href="/wiki/Exchange_value" title="Exchange value">exchange value</a> in the market. Capital, according to Marx, is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_power" title="Labor power">labor power</a> had itself become a commodity under capitalism; the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.</p>
<p>This difference in values, he argues, constitutes <a href="/wiki/Surplus_value" title="Surplus value">surplus value</a>, which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Das_Kapital" title="Das Kapital">Capital</a></i>, Marx argues that the <a href="/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory)" title="Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)">capitalist mode of production</a> is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers — all prior class societies had extracted <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus_labor" title="Surplus labor">surplus labor</a>, but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities. He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent, and are instead forced to sell their labor for a wage.</p>
<p>In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that the working class, due to its relationship to the means of production and numerical superiority under capitalism, would be the driving force behind the socialist revolution. This argument is intertwined with Marx' version of the <a href="/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> arguing that labor is the source of all value, and thus of profit.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, in <i><a href="/wiki/Imperialism,_the_Highest_Stage_of_Capitalism" title="Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism">Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism</a></i> (1916), further developed Marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily led to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monopoly_capitalism" title="Monopoly capitalism">monopoly capitalism</a> and the export of capital — which he also called "imperialism" — to find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism. Some 20th-century <a href="/wiki/Marxian_economics" title="Marxian economics">Marxian economists</a> consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive.</p>
<p>Capitalist class processes, to these thinkers, are simply those in which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surplus_labor" title="Surplus labor">surplus labor</a> takes the form of <a href="/wiki/Surplus_value" title="Surplus value">surplus value</a>, usable as capital; other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes predominate. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is <i>extracted</i>, even if this surplus is not <i>produced</i> by capitalist activity, as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.</p>
<p>In <i>Limits to Capital</i> (1982), <a href="/wiki/David_Harvey" title="David Harvey">David Harvey</a> outlines an overdetermined, "spatially restless" capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and resolution. Harvey used Marx's theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its "fixes" but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be. His work on contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows has been influential. According to Harvey, capitalism creates the conditions for volatile and geographically uneven development </p>
<p>Sociologists such as Ulrich Beck envisioned the society of risk as a new cultural value which saw risk as a commodity to be exchanged in globalized economies. This theory suggested that disasters and capitalist economy were inevitably entwined. Disasters allow the introduction of economic programs which otherwise would be rejected, as well as decentralizing the class structure in production. However, Philosopher Maximiliano Korstanje coined the term Thana-Capitalism to refer to a climate of social Darwinism aimed at fostering the "Survival of the Strongest". In this climate of struggle, only a few win while the rest lose. Social Darwinism is seen as a metaphor explaining our obsession with consumer news and with images related to terrorism attacks, trauma-scapes, and disasters. Korstanje writes that the society of risk has gradually set the pace to a new society of Thana-Capitalism, where the main commodity is death. Not only do we consume death everywhere in the entertainment industry, newspapers, and media but in so doing we reinforce our superiority by witnessing the suffering of others. Korstanje sees the story of Noah's Ark as an allegory for what he dubbed the first genocide. In this mythical event, God divided the world in two parts, the victims and the witnesses. This logic of the supremacy of those who live over those who die is reinforced by Christ´s crucifixion. Today, new emergent segments in the tourist industry are oriented to travel to places where mass deaths or traumatic event have occurred. Korstanje suggests that in secularized societies death is a sign of weakness, and consuming the deaths of others revitalizes the hopes of visitors to enter “the hall of chosen peoples".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supply_and_demand_2">Supply and demand</span></h3>
<p>At least two assumptions are necessary for the validity of the standard model: first, that supply and demand are independent; second, that supply is "constrained by a fixed resource". If these conditions do not hold, then the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marshallian_surplus" title="Marshallian surplus">Marshallian</a> model cannot be sustained. <a href="/wiki/Piero_Sraffa" title="Piero Sraffa">Sraffa's</a> critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good. The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paul_A._Samuelson" title="Paul A. Samuelson">Paul A. Samuelson</a>'s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:</p>

<p>Aggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely, at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Counter-criticisms">Counter-criticisms</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Austrian_School">Austrian School</span></h4>
<p>Austrian School economists have argued that capitalism can organise itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism. Friedrich Hayek considered the phenomenon of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Self-organisation" title="Self-organisation">self-organisation</a> as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people, and the opportunity to earn profits if successful, or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle, gives entrepreneurs <a href="/wiki/Incentive" title="Incentive">incentive</a> to use their <a href="/wiki/Dispersed_knowledge" title="Dispersed knowledge">knowledge</a> and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</span></h4>
<p>The novelist and philosopher <a href="/wiki/Ayn_Rand" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> made positive moral defences of <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism, most notably in her 1957 novel <i><a href="/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged" title="Atlas Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></i>, and in her 1966 collection of essays <i><a href="/wiki/Capitalism:_The_Unknown_Ideal" title="Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal">Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</a></i>. She argued that capitalism should be supported on moral grounds, not just on the basis of practical benefits. She has significantly influenced conservative and <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> supporters of capitalism, especially in the American <a href="/wiki/Tea_Party_movement" title="Tea Party movement">Tea Party movement</a>. Ayn Rand defines capitalism as "a social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which all property is privately owned." According to Rand, the role of government in a capitalist state has three broad categories of proper functions: First, the police "to protect men from criminals". Second, the armed services "to protect men from foreign invaders". Third, the law courts "to settle disputes among men according to objective laws".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_growth">Economic growth</span></h3>


<p>Many theorists and policymakers in predominantly capitalist nations have emphasised capitalism's ability to promote economic growth, as measured by <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP), <a href="/wiki/Capacity_utilization" title="Capacity utilization">capacity utilization</a> or <a href="/wiki/Standard_of_living" title="Standard of living">standard of living</a>. This argument was central, for example, to Adam Smith's advocacy of letting a free market control production and price, and allocate resources. Many theorists have noted that this increase in global GDP over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system.</p>
<p>Between 1000 and 1820, the world economy grew sixfold, a faster rate than the population growth, so individuals enjoyed, on average, a 50% increase in income. Between 1820 and 1998, world economy grew 50-fold, a much faster rate than the population growth, so individuals enjoyed, on average, a 9-fold increase in income. In most capitalist economic regions such as Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the economy grew 19-fold per person, even though these countries already had a higher starting level, and in Japan, which was poor in 1820, the increase per person was 31-fold. In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_world" title="Third world">third world</a> there was an increase, but only 5-fold per person.</p>
<p>Proponents argue that increasing GDP (per capita) is empirically shown to bring about improved standards of living, such as better availability of food, housing, clothing, and health care. The decrease in the number of hours worked per week and the decreased participation of children and the elderly in the workforce have been attributed to capitalism.</p>

He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Brennan_(economist)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Andrew Brennan (economist) (page does not exist)">Andrew Brennan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by <a href="/wiki/Political_repression" title="Political repression">political repression</a>. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary, and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by <a href="/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>, who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive. <a href="/wiki/Freedom_House" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a>, an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom, and human rights, has argued "there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom <a href="/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World" title="Freedom in the World">as measured by Freedom House</a> and economic freedom <a href="/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom" title="Index of Economic Freedom">as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey</a>."</p>
