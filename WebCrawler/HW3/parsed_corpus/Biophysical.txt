approaches and methods of physics to study biological systems biophysics covers all scales of biological organization from molecular to organismic and populations biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry nanotechnology bioengineering computational biology biomechanics and systems biology the term biophysics was originally introduced by karl pearson in 1892 overview molecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology but more quantitatively seeking to find the physical underpinnings of biomolecular phenomena scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell including the interactions between dna rna and protein biosynthesis as well as how these interactions are regulated a great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions fluorescent imaging techniques as well as electron microscopy x-ray crystallography nmr spectroscopy atomic force microscopy afm and small-angle scattering sas both with x-rays and neutrons saxssans are often used to visualize structures of biological significance protein dynamics can be observed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy conformational change in structure can be measured using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry circular dichroism saxs and sans direct manipulation of molecules using optical tweezers or afm can also be used to monitor biological events where forces and distances are at the nanoscale molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events as systems of interacting entities which can be understood e.g through statistical mechanics thermodynamics and chemical kinetics by drawing knowledge and experimental techniques from a wide variety of disciplines biophysicists are often able to directly observe model or even manipulate the structures and interactions of individual molecules or complexes of molecules in addition to traditional i.e molecular and cellular biophysical topics like structural biology or enzyme kinetics modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research from bioelectronics to quantum biology involving both experimental and theoretical tools it is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from physics as well as mathematics and statistics see biomathematics to larger systems such as tissues organs populations and ecosystems biophysical models are used extensively in the study of electrical conduction in single neurons as well as neural circuit analysis in both tissue and whole brain history some of the earlier studies in biophysics were conducted in the 1840s by a group known as the berlin school of physiologists among its members were pioneers such as hermann von helmholtz ernst heinrich weber carl f w ludwig and johannes peter müller biophysics might even be seen as dating back to the studies of luigi galvani the popularity of the field rose when the book what is life by erwin schrödinger was published since 1957 biophysicists have organized themselves into the biophysical society which now has about 9,000 members over the world focus as a subfield while some colleges and universities have dedicated departments of biophysics usually at the graduate level many do not have university-level biophysics departments instead having groups in related departments such as molecular biology biochemistry chemistry computer science mathematics medicine pharmacology physiology physics and neuroscience depending on the strengths of a department at a university differing emphasis will be given to fields of biophysics what follows is a list of examples of how each department applies its efforts toward the study of biophysics this list is hardly all inclusive nor does each subject of study belong exclusively to any particular department each academic institution makes its own rules and there is much overlap between departments biology and molecular biology – almost all forms of biophysics efforts are included in some biology department somewhere typical examples include gene regulation single protein dynamics bioenergetics patch clamping biomechanics virophysics structural biology – Ångstrom-resolution structures of proteins nucleic acids lipids carbohydrates and complexes thereof biochemistry and chemistry – biomolecular structure sirna nucleic acid structure structure-activity relationships computer science – neural networks biomolecular and drug databases computational chemistry – molecular dynamics simulation molecular docking quantum chemistry bioinformatics – sequence alignment structural alignment protein structure prediction mathematics – graphnetwork theory population modeling dynamical systems phylogenetics medicine and neuroscience – studying neural networks experimentally brain slicing as well as theoretically computer models membrane permitivity gene therapy understanding tumors pharmacology and physiology – channelomics biomolecular interactions cellular membranes polyketides physics – negentropy stochastic processes covering dynamics quantum biology – the field of quantum biology applies quantum mechanics to biological objects and problems decohered isomers to yield time-dependent base substitutions these studies imply applications in quantum computing agronomy and agriculture many biophysical techniques are unique to this field
