the family fabaceae or leguminosae legumes are grown agriculturally primarily for their grain seed called pulse for livestock forage and silage and as soil-enhancing green manure well-known legumes include alfalfa clover peas beans lentils lupin bean mesquite carob soybeans peanuts and tamarind a legume fruit is a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually dehisces opens along a seam on two sides a common name for this type of fruit is a pod although the term pod is also applied to a few other fruit types such as that of vanilla a capsule and of radish a silique legumes are notable in that most of them have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in structures called root nodules for that reason they play a key role in crop rotation terminology see also bean § terminology the term pulse as used by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao is reserved for crops harvested solely for the dry seed this excludes green beans and green peas which are considered vegetable crops also excluded are seeds that are mainly grown for oil extraction oilseeds like soybeans and peanuts and seeds which are used exclusively for sowing forage clovers alfalfa however in common usage these distinctions are not always clearly made and many of the varieties used for dried pulses are also used for green vegetables with their beans in pods while young some fabaceae such as scotch broom and other genisteae are leguminous but are usually not called legumes by farmers who tend to restrict that term to food crops uses farmed legumes can belong to many agricultural classes including forage grain blooms pharmaceuticalindustrial fallowgreen manure and timber species most commercially farmed species fill two or more roles simultaneously depending upon their degree of maturity when harvested human consumption grain legumes are cultivated for their seeds the seeds are used for human and animal consumption or for the production of oils for industrial uses grain legumes include beans lentils lupins peas and peanuts nutritional value legumes are a significant source of protein dietary fiber carbohydrates and dietary minerals for example a 100 gram serving of cooked chickpeas contains 18 of the daily value dv for protein 30 dv for dietary fiber 43 dv for folate and 52 dv for manganese like other plant-based foods pulses contain no cholesterol and little fat or sodium legumes are also an excellent source of resistant starch which is broken down by bacteria in the large intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids used by intestinal cells for food energy preliminary studies in humans include the potential for regular consumption of legumes in a vegetarian diet to affect metabolic syndrome there is evidence that a portion of pulses roughly one cup daily in a diet may help lower blood pressure and reduce ldl cholesterol levels though there is a concern about the quality of the supporting data classification fao recognizes 11

sword bean canavalia gladiata winged bean psophocarpus tetragonolobus velvet bean cowitch mucuna pruriens var utilis yam bean pachyrhizus erosus forage forage legumes are of two broad types some like alfalfa clover vetch vicia stylo stylosanthes or arachis are sown in pasture and grazed by livestock other forage legumes such as leucaena or albizia are woody shrub or tree species that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide livestock feed other uses legume species grown for their flowers include lupins which are farmed commercially for their blooms as well as being popular in gardens worldwide industrially farmed legumes include indigofera and acacia species which are cultivated for dye and natural gum production respectively fallowgreen manure legume species are cultivated to be tilled back into the soil in order to exploit the high levels of captured atmospheric nitrogen found in the roots of most legumes numerous legumes farmed for this purpose include leucaena cyamopsis and sesbania species various legume species are farmed for timber production worldwide including numerous acacia species and castanospermum australe legume trees like the locust trees gleditsia robinia or the kentucky coffeetree gymnocladus dioicus can be used in permaculture food forests other legume trees like laburnum and the woody climbing vine wisteria are poisonous nitrogen fixation main articles nitrogen fixation and green manure many legumes contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within root nodules of their root systems plants belonging to the genus styphnolobium are one exception to this rule these bacteria have the special ability of fixing nitrogen from atmospheric molecular nitrogen n2 into ammonia nh3 the chemical reaction is ammonia is then converted to another form ammonium nh 4 usable by some plants by the following reaction this arrangement means that the root nodules are sources of nitrogen for legumes making them relatively rich in plant proteins all proteins contain nitrogenous amino acids nitrogen is therefore a necessary ingredient in the production of proteins hence legumes are among the best sources of plant protein when a legume plant dies in the field for example following the harvest all of its remaining nitrogen incorporated into amino acids inside the remaining plant parts is released back into the soil in the soil the amino acids are converted to nitrate no− 3 making the nitrogen available to other plants thereby serving as fertilizer for future crops in many traditional and organic farming practices crop rotation involving legumes is common by alternating between legumes and nonlegumes sometimes planting nonlegumes two times in a row and then a legume the field usually receives a sufficient amount of nitrogenous compounds to produce a good result even when the crop is nonleguminous legumes are sometimes referred to as green manure history archaeologists have discovered traces of pulse production around ravi river punjab the seat of the indus valley civilisation dating circa 3300 bc meanwhile evidence of lentil cultivation has also been found in egyptian pyramids and dry pea seeds have been discovered in a swiss village that are believed to date back to the stone age archaeological evidence suggests that these peas must have been grown in the eastern mediterranean and mesopotamia regions at least 5,000 years ago and in britain as early as the 11th century world economy india is the worlds largest producer and the largest consumer of pulses pakistan canada myanmar australia and the united states in that order are significant exporters and are indias most significant suppliers the global pulse market is estimated at 60 million tonnes international year of pulses main article international year of pulses the international year of pulses 2016 iyp 2016 was declared by the sixty-eighth session of the united nations general assembly the food and agriculture organization of the united nations has been nominated to facilitate the implementation of iyp 2016 in collaboration with governments relevant organizations non-governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders its aim is to heighten public awareness of the nutritional benefits of pulses as part of sustainable food production aimed towards food security and nutrition iyp 2016 will create an opportunity to encourage connections throughout the food chain that would better utilize pulse-based proteins further global production of pulses better utilize crop rotations and address
