is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants also known as angiosperms formed from the ovary after flowering fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds edible fruits in particular have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition in fact humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food accordingly fruits account for a substantial fraction of the worlds agricultural output and some such as the apple and the pomegranate have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings in common language usage fruit normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state such as apples bananas grapes lemons oranges and strawberries on the other hand in botanical usage fruit includes many structures that are not commonly called fruits such as bean pods corn kernels tomatoes and wheat grains the section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body botanic fruit and culinary fruit many common terms for seeds and fruit do not correspond to the botanical classifications in culinary terminology a fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant part especially a botanical fruit a nut is any hard oily and shelled plant product and a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant product however in botany a fruit is the ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds a nut is a type of fruit and not a seed and a seed is a ripened ovule examples of culinary vegetables and nuts that are botanically fruit include corn cucurbits e.g cucumber pumpkin and squash eggplant legumes beans peanuts and peas sweet pepper and tomato in addition some spices such as allspice and chili pepper are fruits botanically speaking in contrast rhubarb is often referred to as a fruit because it is used to make sweet desserts such as pies though only the petiole leaf stalk of the rhubarb plant is edible and edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names e.g ginkgo nuts and pine nuts botanically a cereal grain such as corn rice or wheat is also a kind of fruit termed a caryopsis however the fruit wall is very thin and is fused to the seed coat so almost all of the edible grain is actually a seed fruit structure main article fruit anatomy the outer often edible layer is the pericarp formed from the ovary and surrounding the seeds although in some species other tissues contribute to or form the edible portion the pericarp may be described in three layers from outer to inner the epicarp mesocarp and endocarp fruit that bears a prominent pointed terminal projection is said to be beaked fruit development a fruit results from maturation of one or more flowers and the gynoecium of the flowers forms all or part of the fruit inside the ovaryovaries are one or more ovules where the megagametophyte contains the egg cell after double fertilization these ovules will become seeds the ovules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers after pollination a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte within the megagametophyte one of the two sperm unites with the egg forming a zygote and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell which completes the double fertilization process later the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed and the endosperm mother cell will give rise to endosperm a nutritive tissue used by the embryo as the ovules develop into seeds the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall the pericarp may become fleshy as in berries or drupes or form a hard outer covering as in nuts in some multiseeded fruits the extent to which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules the pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp outer layer also called epicarp mesocarp middle layer and endocarp inner layer in some fruits especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary other parts of the flower such as the floral tube including the petals sepals and stamens fuse with the ovary and ripen with it in other cases the sepals petals andor stamens and style of the flower fall off when such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit it is called an accessory fruit since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms there are three general modes of fruit development apocarpous fruits develop from a single flower having one or more separate carpels and they are the simplest fruits syncarpous fruits develop from a single gynoecium having two or more carpels fused together multiple fruits form from many different flowers plant scientists have grouped fruits into three main groups simple fruits aggregate fruits and composite or multiple fruits the groupings are not evolutionarily relevant since many diverse plant taxa may be in the same group but reflect how the flower organs are arranged and how the fruits develop simple fruit simple fruits can be either dry or fleshy and result from the ripening of a simple or compound ovary in a flower with only one pistil dry fruits may be either dehiscent they open to discharge seeds or indehiscent they do not open to discharge seeds types of dry simple fruits and examples of each include achene – most commonly seen in aggregate fruits e.g strawberry capsule – e.g brazil nut caryopsis – e.g wheat cypsela – an achene-like fruit derived from the individual florets in a capitulum e.g dandelion fibrous drupe – e.g coconut walnut follicle – is formed from a single carpel opens by one suture e.g milkweed commonly seen in aggregate fruits e.g magnolia legume – e.g bean pea peanut loment – a type of indehiscent legume nut – e.g beech hazelnut oak acorn samara – e.g ash elm maple key schizocarp – e.g carrot seed silique – e.g radish seed silicle – e.g shepherds purse utricle – e.g beet fruits in which part or all of the pericarp fruit wall is fleshy at maturity are simple fleshy fruits types of simple fleshy fruits with examples include berry – e.g cranberry gooseberry redcurrant tomato stone fruit or drupe e.g apricot cherry olive peach plum an aggregate fruit or etaerio develops from a single flower with numerous simple pistils magnolia and peony collection of follicles developing from one flower sweet gum collection of capsules sycamore collection of achenes teasel collection of cypsellas tuliptree collection of samaras the pome fruits of the family rosaceae including apples pears rosehips and saskatoon berry are a syncarpous fleshy fruit a simple fruit developing from a half-inferior ovary schizocarp fruits form from a syncarpous ovary and do not really dehisce but rather split into segments with one or more seeds they include a number of different forms from a wide range of families carrot seed is an example aggregate fruit main article aggregate fruit aggregate fruits form from single flowers that have multiple carpels which are not joined together i.e each pistil contains one carpel each pistil forms a fruitlet and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes follicles drupelets and berries ranunculaceae species including clematis and ranunculus have an etaerio of achenes calotropis has an etaerio of follicles and rubus species like raspberry have an etaerio of drupelets annona have an etaerio of berries the raspberry whose pistils are termed drupelets because each is like a small drupe attached to the receptacle in some bramble fruits such as blackberry the receptacle is elongated and part of the ripe fruit making the blackberry an aggregate-accessory fruit the strawberry is also an aggregate-accessory fruit only one in which the seeds are contained in achenes in all these examples the fruit develops from a single flower with numerous pistils multiple fruits main article multiple fruit a multiple fruit is one formed from a cluster of flowers called an inflorescence each flower produces a fruit but these mature into a single mass examples are the pineapple fig mulberry osage-orange and breadfruit in the photograph on the right stages of flowering and fruit development in the noni or indian mulberry morinda citrifolia can be observed on a single branch first an inflorescence of white flowers called a head is produced after fertilization each flower develops into a drupe and as the drupes expand they become connate merge into a multiple fleshy fruit called a syncarp berries main article berry berries are another type of fleshy fruit they are simple fruit created from a single ovary the ovary may be compound with several carpels types include examples follow in the table below pepo – berries whose skin is hardened cucurbits hesperidium – berries with a rind and a juicy interior like most citrus fruit accessory fruit main article accessory fruit some or all of the edible part of accessory fruit is not generated by the ovary accessory fruit can be simple aggregate or multiple i.e they can include one or more pistils and other parts from the same flower or the pistils and other parts of many flowers table of fruit examples seedless fruits seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of seedless fruits some cultivars of citrus fruits especially grapefruit mandarin oranges navel oranges satsumas table grapes and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness in some species seedlessness is the result of parthenocarpy where fruits set without fertilization parthenocarpic fruit set may or may not require pollination but most seedless citrus fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit seedless bananas and grapes are triploids and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization a phenomenon known as stenospermocarpy which requires normal pollination and fertilization seed dissemination variations in fruit structures largely depend on their seeds mode of dispersal this dispersal can be achieved by animals explosive dehiscence water or wind some fruits have coats covered with spikes or hooked burrs either to prevent themselves from being eaten by animals or to stick to the feathers hairs or legs of animals using them as dispersal agents examples include cocklebur and unicorn plant the sweet flesh of many fruits is deliberately appealing to animals so that the seeds held within are eaten and unwittingly carried away and deposited i.e defecated at a distance from the parent likewise the nutritious oily kernels of nuts are appealing to rodents such as squirrels which hoard them in the soil to avoid starving during the winter thus giving those seeds that remain uneaten the chance to germinate and grow into a new plant away from their parent other fruits are elongated and flattened out naturally and so become thin like wings or helicopter blades e.g elm maple and tuliptree this is an evolutionary mechanism to increase dispersal distance away from the parent via wind other wind-dispersed fruit have tiny parachutes e.g dandelion milkweed salsify coconut fruits can float thousands of miles in the ocean to spread seeds some other fruits that can disperse via water are nipa palm and screw pine some fruits fling seeds substantial distances up to 100 m in sandbox tree via explosive dehiscence or other mechanisms e.g impatiens and squirting cucumber uses many hundreds of fruits including fleshy fruits like apple kiwifruit mango peach pear and watermelon are commercially valuable as human food eaten both fresh and as jams marmalade and other preserves fruits are also used in manufactured foods e.g cakes cookies ice cream muffins or yogurt or beverages such as fruit juices e.g apple juice grape juice or orange juice or alcoholic beverages e.g brandy fruit beer or wine fruits are also used for gift giving e.g in the form of fruit baskets and fruit bouquets many vegetables in culinary parlance are botanical fruits including bell pepper cucumber eggplant green bean okra pumpkin squash tomato and zucchini olive fruit is pressed for olive oil spices like allspice black pepper paprika and vanilla are derived from berries nutritional value fresh fruits are generally high in fiber vitamin c and water regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with aging nonfood uses because fruits have been such a major part of the human diet various cultures have developed many different uses for fruits they do not depend on for food for example bayberry fruits provide a wax often used to make candles many dry fruits are used as decorations or in dried flower arrangements e.g annual honesty cotoneaster lotus milkweed unicorn plant and wheat ornamental trees and shrubs are often cultivated for their colorful fruits including beautyberry cotoneaster holly pyracantha skimmia and viburnum fruits of opium poppy are the source of opium which contains the drugs codeine and morphine as well as the biologically inactive chemical theabaine from which the drug oxycodone is synthesized osage orange fruits are used to repel cockroaches many fruits provide natural dyes e.g cherry mulberry sumac and walnut dried gourds are used as bird houses cups decorations dishes musical instruments and water jugs pumpkins are carved into jack-o-lanterns for halloween the spiny fruit of burdock or cocklebur inspired the invention of velcro coir fiber from coconut shells is used for brushes doormats floor tiles insulation mattresses sacking and as a growing medium for container plants the shell of the coconut fruit is used to make bird houses bowls cups musical instruments and souvenir heads fruit is often a subject of still life paintings safety for food safety the cdc recommends proper fruit handling and preparation to reduce the risk of food contamination and foodborne illness fresh fruits and vegetables should be carefully selected at the store they should not be damaged or bruised and pre-cut pieces should be refrigerated or surrounded by ice all fruits and vegetables should be rinsed before eating this recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten it should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature spoilage fruits and vegetables should be kept separate from raw foods like meat poultry and seafood as well as from utensils that have come in contact with raw foods fruits and vegetables that are not going to be cooked should be thrown away if they have touched raw meat poultry seafood or eggs all cut peeled or cooked fruits and vegetables should be refrigerated within two hours after a certain time harmful bacteria may grow on them and increase the risk of foodborne illness allergies fruit allergies make up about 10 percent of all food related allergies storage all fruits benefit from proper post harvest care and in many fruits the plant hormone ethylene causes ripening therefore maintaining most fruits in an efficient cold chain is optimal for post harvest storage with the aim of extending and ensuring shelf life see
