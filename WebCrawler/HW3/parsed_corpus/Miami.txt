suburbs are located on a broad plain between the florida everglades to the west and biscayne bay to the east which also extends from florida bay north to lake okeechobee the elevation of the area never rises above 40 ft 12 m and averages at around 6 ft 1.8 m above mean sea level in most neighborhoods especially near the coast the highest undulations are found along the coastal miami rock ridge whose substrate underlies most of the eastern miami metropolitan region the main portion of the city lies on the shores of biscayne bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands the largest of which contains miami beach and south beach the gulf stream a warm ocean current runs northward just 15 miles 24 km off the coast allowing the citys climate to stay warm and mild all year geology the surface bedrock under the miami area is called miami oolite or miami limestone this bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil and is no more than 50 feet 15 m thick miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages beginning some 130,000 years ago the sangamonian stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet 8 m above the current level all of southern florida was covered by a shallow sea several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged florida plateau stretching from the present miami area to what is now the dry tortugas the area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon and the miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans starting about 100,000 years ago the wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels exposing the floor of the lagoon by 15,000 years ago the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet 90 to 110 m below the contemporary level the sea level rose quickly after that stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago leaving the mainland of south florida just above sea level beneath the plain lies the biscayne aquifer a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern palm beach county to florida bay with its highest point peaking around the cities of miami springs and hialeah most of the miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer as a result of the aquifer it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft 5 to 6 m beneath the city without hitting water which impedes underground construction though some underground parking garages exist for this reason the mass transit systems in and around miami are elevated or

east coast railway began construction of a higher-speed rail line in south florida that is planned to eventually terminate at orlando international airport road miamis road system is based along the numerical miami grid where flagler street forms the east-west baseline and miami avenue forms the north-south meridian the corner of flagler street and miami avenue is in the middle of downtown in front of the downtown macys formerly the burdines headquarters the miami grid is primarily numerical so that for example all street addresses north of flagler street and west of miami avenue have nw in their address because its point of origin is in downtown which is close to the coast therefore the nw and sw quadrants are much larger than the se and ne quadrants many roads especially major ones are also named e.g tamiami trailsw 8th st although with exceptions the number is in more common usage among locals with few exceptions within this grid northsouth roads are designated as courts roads avenues or places often remembered by their acronym while eastwest roads are streets terraces drives or occasionally ways major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals there are 16 blocks to each mile on northsouth avenues and 10 blocks to each mile on eastwest streets major northsouth avenues generally end in 7  e.g 17th 27th 37thdouglas aves 57thred rd 67thludlam 87thgalloway etc all the way west beyond 177thkrome avenue one prominent exception is 42nd avenue lejeune road located at the half-mile point instead major eastwest streets to the south of downtown are multiples of 16 though the beginning point of this system is at sw 8th st one half mile south of flagler zeroth street thus major streets are at 8th st 16 24th st.coral way 16 40th st.bird 16 56thmiller 16 72nd

16 248thcoconut palm etc well into the 300s within the grid odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side this makes even unfamiliar addresses and distances easy  if one must travel from say 1709 sw 8th st to 24832 sw 157th avenue one knows it will be 140 blocks 157-17 20 miles to the west and 240 blocks 248-8 15 miles to the south and that the destination will be on the south side of 248th st remarkably even miami natives are often unaware of this pattern all streets and avenues in miami-dade county follow the miami grid with a few exceptions most notably coral gables hialeah coconut grove and miami beach one neighborhood the roads is thusly named because its streets run off the miami grid at a 45-degree
