substances used as food for common table sugar see sucrose for other uses see sugar disambiguation lump sugar and white sugar redirect here for the south korean film see lump sugar for the joanne shaw taylor album see white sugar album sugar is the generalized name for sweet short-chain soluble carbohydrates many of which are used in food they are composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen there are various types of sugar derived from different sources simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose also known as dextrose fructose and galactose the table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose a disaccharide in the body sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose other disaccharides include maltose and lactose longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste but are not classified as sugars some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar described as artificial sweeteners sugars are found in the tissues of most plants but are present in sufficient concentrations for efficient extraction only in sugarcane and sugar beet sugarcane refers to any of several species of giant grass in the genus saccharum that have been cultivated in tropical climates in south asia and southeast asia since ancient times a great expansion in its production took place in the 18th century with the establishment of sugar plantations in the west indies and americas this was the first time that sugar became available to the common people who had previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods sugar beet a cultivated variety of beta vulgaris is grown as a root crop in cooler climates and became a major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available sugar production and trade have changed the course of human history in many ways influencing the formation of colonies the perpetuation of slavery the transition to indentured labour the migration of peoples wars between sugar-trade–controlling nations in the 19th century and the ethnic composition and political structure of the new world the world produced about 168 million tonnes of sugar in 2011 the average person consumes about 24 kilograms 53 lb of sugar each year 33.1 kg in industrialised countries equivalent to over 260 food calories per person per day since the latter part of the twentieth century it has been questioned whether a diet high in sugars especially refined sugars is good for human health sugar has been linked to obesity and suspected of or fully implicated as a cause in the occurrence of diabetes cardiovascular disease dementia macular degeneration and tooth decay numerous studies have been undertaken to try to clarify the position but with varying results mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that do not consume or are largely free of any sugar consumption etymology the etymology reflects the spread of the commodity the english word sugar originates from the sanskrit शर्करा śarkarā via persian شکر shakkar it most probably came to england by way of italian merchants the contemporary italian word is zucchero whereas the spanish and portuguese words azúcar and açúcar respectively have kept a trace of the arabic definite article the old french word is zuchre – contemporary french sucre the earliest greek word attested is σάκχαρις sákkʰaris a satisfactory pedigree explaining the spread of the word has yet to be done the english word jaggery a coarse brown sugar made from date palm sap or sugarcane juice has a similar etymological origin portuguese xagara or jagara from the sanskrit śarkarā history main article history of sugar ancient times and middle ages sugar has been produced in the indian subcontinent since ancient times it was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening in most parts of the world originally people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness sugarcane was a native of tropical south asia and southeast asia different species seem to have originated from different locations with saccharum barberi originating in india and s edule and s officinarum coming from new guinea one of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century bc that state that the use of sugarcane originated in india sugar was found in europe by the 1st century ad but only as an imported medicine and not as a food the greek physician dioscorides in the 1st century ad described sugar in his medical treatise de materia medica and pliny the elder a 1st century ad roman described sugar in his natural history sugar is made in arabia as well but indian sugar is better it is a kind of honey found in cane white as gum and it crunches between the teeth it comes in lumps the size of a hazelnut sugar is used only for medical purposes sugar remained relatively unimportant until the indians discovered methods of turning sugarcane juice into granulated crystals that were easier to store and to transport crystallized sugar was discovered by the time of the imperial guptas around the 5th century ad in the local indian language these crystals were called khanda devanagariखण्ड,khaṇḍa which is the source of the word candy indian sailors who carried clarified butter and sugar as supplies introduced knowledge of sugar on the various trade routes they travelled buddhist monks as they travelled around brought sugar crystallization methods to china during the reign of harsha r 606–647 in north india indian envoys in tang china taught methods of cultivating sugarcane after emperor taizong of tang r 626–649 made known his interest in sugar china then established its first sugarcane plantations in the seventh century chinese documents confirm at least two missions to india initiated in 647 ad to obtain technology for sugar refining in south asia the middle east and china sugar became a staple of cooking and desserts crusaders brought sugar home with them to europe after their campaigns in the holy land where they encountered caravans carrying sweet salt early in the 12th century venice acquired some villages near tyre and set up estates to produce sugar for export to europe where it supplemented honey which had previously been the only available sweetener crusade chronicler william of tyre writing in the late 12th century described sugar as very necessary for the use and health of mankind in the 15th century venice was the chief sugar refining and distribution centre in europe modern history see also triangular trade in august 1492 christopher columbus stopped at la gomera in the canary islands for wine and water intending to stay only four days he became romantically involved with the governor of the island beatriz de bobadilla y ossorio and stayed a month when he finally sailed she gave him cuttings of sugarcane which became the first to reach the new world the first sugar cane harvest was conducted in hispaniola in 1501 and many sugar mills had been constructed in cuba and jamaica by the 1520s the portuguese took sugar cane to brazil by 1540 there were 800 cane sugar mills in santa catarina island and another 2,000 on the north coast of brazil demarara and surinam sugar was a luxury in europe until the 18th century when it became more widely available it then became popular and by the 19th century sugar came to be considered a necessity this evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes it drove in part colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive the demand for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from africa in particular west africa after slavery was abolished there was high demand for indentured laborers from south asia in particular india millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the caribbean and the americas indian ocean colonies southeast asia pacific islands and east africa and natal the modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the demand for sugar sugar also led to some industrialization of areas where sugar cane was grown for example lieutenant j paterson of the bengal establishment persuaded the british government that sugar cane could be cultivated in british india with many advantages and at less expense than in the west indies as a result sugar factories were established in bihar in eastern india during the napoleonic wars sugar beet production increased in continental europe because of the difficulty of importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade by 1880 the sugar beet was the main source of sugar in europe it was cultivated in lincolnshire and other parts of england although the united kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies until the late nineteenth century sugar was purchased in loaves which had to be cut using implements called sugar nips in later years granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century the first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the moravian jakub kryštof rad director of a sugar company in dačice he began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on january 23 1843 henry tate of tate lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in liverpool and london tate purchased a patent for sugar cube manufacture from german eugen langen who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes chemistry main article carbohydrate scientifically sugar loosely refers to a number of carbohydrates such as monosaccharides disaccharides or oligosaccharides monosaccharides are also called simple sugars the most important being glucose almost all sugars have the formula c nh 2no n n is between 3 and 7 glucose has the molecular formula c 6h 12o 6 the names of typical sugars end with ose as in glucose and fructose sometimes such words may also refer to any types of carbohydrates soluble in water the acyclic mono and disaccharides contain either aldehyde groups or ketone groups these carbon-oxygen double bonds co are the reactive centers all saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds with the resultant loss of a molecule of water h 2o per bond monosaccharides in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides creating disaccharides such as sucrose and polysaccharides such as starch enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized after digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include glucose fructose and galactose many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures in these closed-chain forms the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium with less than 0.1 of the molecules in the open-chain form natural polymers of sugars biopolymers of sugars are common in nature through photosynthesis plants produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate g3p a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose c 6h 12o 6 or as in cane and beet sucrose c 12h 22o 11 monosaccharides may be further converted into structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectin for cell wall construction or into energy reserves in the form of storage polysaccharides such as starch or inulin starch consisting of two different polymers of glucose is a readily degradable form of chemical energy stored by cells and can be converted to other types of energy another polymer of glucose is cellulose which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units it is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent though ruminants can do so with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their gut dna and rna are built up of the monosaccharides deoxyribose and ribose respectively deoxyribose has the formula c 5h 10o 4 and ribose the formula c 5h 10o 5 flammability because sugars burn easily when exposed to flame the handling of sugars risks dust explosion the 2008 georgia sugar refinery explosion which killed 14 persons and injured 40 and destroyed most of the refinery was caused by the ignition of sugar dust types of sugar monosaccharides fructose galactose and glucose are all simple sugars monosaccharides with the general formula c6h12o6 they have five hydroxyl groups −oh and a carbonyl group co and are cyclic when dissolved in water they each exist as several isomers with dextro and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized light to diverge to the right or the left fructose or fruit sugar occurs naturally in fruits some root vegetables cane sugar and honey and is the sweetest of the sugars it is one of the components of sucrose or table sugar it is used as a high-fructose syrup which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield corn syrup with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into fructose in general galactose does not occur in the free state but is a constituent with glucose of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar it is less sweet than glucose it is a component of the antigens found on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood groups glucose dextrose or grape sugar occurs naturally in fruits and plant juices and is the primary product of photosynthesis most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion and it is the form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream it can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs it can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis disaccharides lactose maltose and sucrose are all compound sugars disaccharides with the general formula c12h22o11 they are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water lactose is the naturally occurring sugar found in milk a molecule of lactose is formed by the combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose it is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest lactose maltose is formed during the germination of certain grains the most notable being barley which is converted into malt the source of the sugars name a molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose it is less sweet than glucose fructose or sucrose it is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase sucrose is found in the stems of sugarcane and roots of sugar beet it also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots the different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them a molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose after being eaten sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases sources the sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in table 1 all data with a unit of g gram are based on 100 g of a food item the fructoseglucose ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of free fructose plus half sucrose by the sum of free glucose plus half sucrose production see also list of sugars sugar beet sugar beet beta vulgaris is a biennial plant in the family amaranthaceae the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose it is cultivated in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil the crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed the roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion milk of lime is added to the raw juice and carbonatated in a number of stages in order to purify it water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum the syrup is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals the white sugar that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried it requires no further refining sugarcane sugarcane saccharum spp is a perennial grass in the family poaceae it is cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical regions for the sucrose that is found in its stems it requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plants great growth potential the crop is harvested mechanically or by hand chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant here it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion the juice is then clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes the resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators after which further water is removed by evaporation in vacuum containers the resulting supersaturated solution is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems known as bagasse is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process the crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by sulfur dioxide or can be treated in a carbonatation process to produce a whiter product about 2,500 litres 660 us gal of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced refining refined sugar is made from raw sugar that has undergone a refining process to remove the molasses raw sugar is a sucrose which is synthesized from sugarcane or sugar beet and cannot immediately be consumed before going through the refining process to produce refined sugar or white sugar the sugar may be transported in bulk to the country where it will be used and the refining process often takes place there the first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them the crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water the resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out many of the impurities are removed at the same time removal of colour is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin the sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals causing the sugar to crystallize out the liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used the surplus liquor is made into refiners molasses the international commission for uniform methods of sugar analysis sets standards for the measurement of the purity of refined sugar known as icumsa numbers lower numbers indicate a higher level of purity in the refined sugar refined sugar is widely used for industrial needs for higher quality refined sugar is purer icumsa below 300 than raw sugar icumsa over 1,500 the level of purity associated with the colors of sugar expressed by standard number icumsa international commission for uniform methods of sugar analysis the smaller icumsa numbers indicate that higher purity of sugar producing countries the five largest producers of sugar in 2011 were brazil india the european union china and thailand in the same year the largest exporter of sugar was brazil distantly followed by thailand australia and india the largest importers were the european union united states and indonesia at present brazil has the highest per capita consumption of sugar followed by australia thailand and the european union forms and uses brown sugars are granulated sugars either containing residual molasses or with the grains deliberately coated with molasses to produce a light or dark-colored sugar they are used in baked goods confectionery and toffees granulated sugars are used at the table to sprinkle on foods and to sweeten hot drinks and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to cooked products they are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling as in candied fruits jams and marmalades invert sugars and syrups are blended to manufacturers specifications and are used in breads cakes and beverages for adjusting sweetness aiding moisture retention and avoiding crystallization of sugars liquid sugars are strong syrups consisting of 67 granulated sugar dissolved in water they are used in the food processing of a wide range of products including beverages hard candy ice cream and jams low-calorie sugars and sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners maltodextrin is an easily digestible synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules and is made by the partial hydrolysis of starch the added sweeteners are often aspartame saccharin stevia or sucralose milled sugars known as confectioners sugar and powdered sugar are ground to a fine powder they are used as powdered sugar also known as icing sugar or confectionary sugar for dusting foods and in baking and confectionery molasses is commonly used to make rum and sugar byproducts are used to make ethanol for fuel polyols are sugar alcohols and are used in chewing gums where a sweet flavor is required that lasts for a prolonged time in the mouth screened sugars are crystalline products separated according to the size of the grains they are used for decorative table sugars for blending in dry mixes and in baking and confectionery sugar cubes sometimes called sugar lumps are white or brown granulated sugars lightly steamed and pressed together in block shape they are used to sweeten drinks syrups and treacles are dissolved invert sugars heated to develop the characteristic flavors treacles have added molasses they are used in a range of baked goods and confectionery including toffees and licorice in winemaking fruit sugars are converted into alcohol by a fermentation process if the must formed by pressing the fruit has a low sugar content additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization in the production of sweet wines fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste consumption in most parts of the world sugar is an important part of the human diet making food more palatable and providing food energy after cereals and vegetable oils sugar derived from sugarcane and beet provided more kilocalories per capita per day on average than other food groups according to the fao an average of 24 kilograms 53 lb of sugar equivalent to over 260 food calories per day was consumed annually per person of all ages in the world in 1999 even with rising human populations sugar consumption is expected to increase to 25.1 kilograms 55 lb per person per year by 2015 data collected in multiple nationwide surveys between 1999 and 2008 show that the intake of added sugars has declined by 24 percent with declines occurring in all age ethnic and income groups the per capita consumption of refined sugar in the united states has varied between 27 and 46 kilograms 60 and 101 lb in the last 40 years in 2008 american per capita total consumption of sugar and sweeteners exclusive of artificial sweeteners equalled 61.9 kg 136 lb per year this consisted of 29.65 kg 65.4 lb pounds of refined sugar and 31 kg 68.3 lb pounds of corn-derived sweeteners per person health effects some studies involving the health impact of sugars are effectively inconclusive the fao meta studies and who studies have shown directly contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms hence there are articles such as consumer reports on health that stated in 2008 some of the supposed dietary dangers of sugar have been overblown many studies have debunked the idea that it causes hyperactivity for example addiction sugar addiction is the term for the relationship between sugar and the various aspects of food addiction including bingeing withdrawal craving and cross-sensitization some scientists assert that consumption of sweets or sugar could have a heroin addiction-like effect alzheimers disease claims have been made of a sugar–alzheimers disease connection but debate continues over whether cognitive decline is attributable to dietary fructose or to overall energy intake blood glucose levels carbohydrates are classified according to their glycemic index a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels and glycemic load which takes into account both the glycemic index and the amount of carbohydrate in the food this has led to carbohydrate counting a method used by diabetics for planning their meals cardiovascular disease studies in animals have suggested that chronic consumption of refined sugars can contribute to metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction some experts have suggested that refined fructose is more damaging than refined glucose in terms of cardiovascular risk cardiac performance has been shown to be impaired by switching from a carbohydrate diet including fiber to a high-carbohydrate diet switching from saturated fatty acids to carbohydrates with high glycemic index values shows a statistically-significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction other studies have shown that the risk of developing coronary heart disease is decreased by adopting a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids but low in sugar whereas a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet brings no reduction this suggests that consuming a diet with a high glycemic load typical of the junk food diet is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease the consumption of added sugars has been positively associated with multiple measures known to increase cardiovascular disease risk amongst adolescents as well as adults studies are suggesting that the impact of refined carbohydrates or high glycemic load carbohydrates are more significant than the impact of saturated fatty acids on cardiovascular disease a high dietary intake of sugar in this case sucrose or disaccharide can substantially increase the risk of heart and vascular diseases according to a swedish study of 4301 people undertaken by lund university and malmö university college sugar was associated with higher levels of bad blood lipids causing a high level of small and medium low-density lipoprotein ldl and reduced high-density lipoprotein hdl in contrast the amount of fat eaten did not affect the level of blood fats incidentally quantities of alcohol and protein were linked to an increase in the good hdl blood fat hyperactivity there is a common notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity in particular in children but studies and meta-studies tend to disprove this some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity the who fao meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results are to be expected when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form entirely unrefined while others do one study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally sugar-sensitive they were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups in the experimental group mothers were told that their children were fed sugar and in the control group mothers were told that their children received a placebo in fact all children received the placebo but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive this result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions obesity and diabetes controlled trials have now shown unequivocally that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increases body weight and body fat and that replacement of sugar by artificial sweeteners reduces weight studies on the link between sugars and diabetes are inconclusive with some suggesting that eating excessive amounts of sugar does not increase the risk of diabetes although the extra calories from consuming large amounts of sugar can lead to obesity which may itself increase the risk of developing this metabolic disease other studies show correlation between refined sugar free sugar consumption and the onset of diabetes and negative correlation with the consumption of fiber these included a 2010 meta-analysis of eleven studies involving 310,819 participants and 15,043 cases of type 2 diabetes this found that ssbs sugar-sweetened beverages may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes not only through obesity but also by increasing dietary glycemic load leading to insulin resistance β-cell dysfunction and inflammation as an overview to consumption related to chronic disease and obesity the world health organizations independent meta-studies specifically distinguish free sugars all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer cook or consumer plus sugars naturally present in honey syrups and fruit juices from sugars occurring naturally in food the reports prior to 2000 set the limits for free sugars at a maximum of 10 of carbohydrate intake measured by energy rather than mass and since 2002 have aimed for a level across the entire population of less than 10 the consultation committee recognized that this goal is controversial however the consultation considered that the studies showing no effect of free sugars on excess weight have limitations tooth decay in regard to contributions to tooth decay the role of free sugars is also recommended to be below an absolute maximum of 10 of energy intake with a minimum of zero there is convincing evidence from human intervention studies epidemiological studies animal studies and experimental studies for an association between the amount and frequency of free sugars intake and dental caries while other sugars complex carbohydrate consumption is normally associated with a lower rate of dental caries lower rates of tooth decay have been seen in individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance also studies have shown that the consumption of sugar and starch have different impacts on oral health with the ingestion of starchy foods and fresh fruit being associated with low levels of dental caries recommended dietary intake the world health organization who recommends that both adults and children reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10 of total energy intake a reduction to below 5 of total energy intake brings additional health benefits especially in what regards dental caries these recommendations were based on the totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight and dental caries free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer cook or consumer and sugars naturally present in honey syrups fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates measurements various culinary sugars have different densities due to differences in particle
