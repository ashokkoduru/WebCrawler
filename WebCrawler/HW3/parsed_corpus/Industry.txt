other uses see industry disambiguation industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy the major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry when a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation it is considered to be working in different industries manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in european and north american countries during the industrial revolution upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies this came through many successive rapid advances in technology such as the production of steel and coal following the industrial revolution possibly a third of the worlds economic output are derived that is from manufacturing industries many developed countries and many developingsemi-developed countries peoples republic of china india etc depend significantly on manufacturing industry industries the countries they reside in and the economies of those countries are interlinked in a complex web of interdependence classification main article economic sector industries can be classified in a variety of ways at the top level industry is often classified according to the three-sector theory into sectors primary or extractive secondary or manufacturing and tertiary or services some authors add quaternary knowledge or even quinary culture and research sectors over time the fraction of a societys industry within each sector changes main article industry classification below the economic sectors there are many other more detailed industry classifications these classification systems commonly divide industries according to similar functions and markets and identify businesses producing related products industries can also be identified by product such as construction industry chemical industry petroleum industry automotive industry electronic industry meatpacking industry hospitality industry food industry fish industry software industry paper industry entertainment industry semiconductor industry cultural industry and poverty industry market-based classification systems such as the global industry classification standard and the industry classification benchmark are used in finance and market research isic main article international standard industrial classification the international standard industrial classification isic of all economic activities is the most complete and systematic industrial classification made by the united nations statistics division isic is a standard classification of economic activities arranged so that entities can be classified according to the activity they carry out the categories of isic at the most detailed level classes are delineated according to what is in most countries the customary combination of activities described in statistical units considering the relative importance of the activities included in these classes while isic rev.4 continues to use criteria such as input output and use of the products produced more emphasis has been given to the character of the production process in defining and delineating isic classes industrial development the industrial revolution led to the development of factories for large-scale production with consequent changes in society originally the factories were steam-powered but later transitioned to electricity once an electrical grid was developed the mechanized assembly line was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion with individual workers performing specific steps during the process this led to significant increases in efficiency lowering the cost of the end process later automation was increasingly used to replace human operators this process has accelerated with the development of the computer and the robot deindustrialisation main article deindustrialisation historically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage an example of the former is the decline in carriage manufacturing when the automobile was mass-produced a recent trend has been the migration of prosperous industrialized nations towards a post-industrial society this is manifested by an increase in the service sector at the expense of manufacturing and the development of an information-based economy the so-called informational revolution in a post-industrial society manufacturing is relocated to economically more favourable locations through a process of off-shoring the difficulty for people looking to measure manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect is finding a measurement which is stable historically traditionally success has been measured in the number of jobs created the lowering of employee numbers in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to be caused by a decline in the competitiveness of the sector although much has been caused by the introduction of the lean manufacturing process eventually this will lead to competing product lines being managed by one or two people as is already the case in the cigarette manufacturing industry related to this change is the upgrading of the quality of the product being manufactured while it is easy to produce a low tech low skill product the ability to manufacture high quality products is limited to companies with a highly skilled staff society main article industrial society an industrial society can be defined in many ways today industry is an important part of most societies and nations a government must have some kind of industrial policy regulating industrial placement industrial pollution financing and industrial labour industrial labour main article industrial labour further information industrial sociology industrial and organizational psychology industrial district and industrial park in an industrial society industry employs a major part of the population this occurs typically in the manufacturing sector a labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages hours and other working conditions the trade union through its leadership bargains with the employer on behalf of union members rank and file members and negotiates labour contracts with employers this movement first rose among industrial workers war main article industrial warfare the industrial revolution changed warfare with mass-produced weaponry and supplies machine-powered transportation mobilization the total war concept and weapons of mass destruction early instances of industrial warfare were the crimean war and the american civil war but its full potential showed during the world wars see also
