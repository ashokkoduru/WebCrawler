payments for ecosystem services pes also known as payments for environmental services or benefits are incentives offered to farmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide some sort of ecological service they have been defined as a transparent system for the additional provision of environmental services through conditional payments to voluntary providers these programmes promote the conservation of natural resources in the marketplace ecosystem services have no standardized definition but might broadly be called “the benefits of nature to households communities and economies” or more simply “the good things nature does twenty-four specific ecosystem services were identified and assessed by the millennium ecosystem assessment a 2005 un-sponsored report designed to assess the state of the worlds ecosystems the report defined the broad categories of ecosystem services as food production in the form of crops livestock capture fisheries aquaculture and wild foods fiber in the form of timber cotton hemp and silk genetic resources biochemicals natural medicines and pharmaceuticals fresh water air quality regulation climate regulation water regulation erosion regulation water purification and waste treatment disease regulation pest regulation pollination natural hazard regulation and cultural services including spiritual religious and aesthetic values recreation and ecotourism notably however there is a “big three” among these 24 services which are currently receiving the most money and interest worldwide these are climate change mitigation watershed services and biodiversity conservation and demand for these services in particular is predicted to continue to grow as time goes on one seminal 1997 nature magazine article estimated the annual value of global ecological benefits at 33 trillion a number nearly twice the gross global product at the time in 2014 the author of this 1997 research robert costanza and a qualified group of co-authors re-took this assessment  using only a slightly modified methodology but with more detailed 2011 data  and increased the aggregate global ecosystem services provisioning estimate to between 125–145 trillion a year the same research project also estimated between 4.3 to 20.2 trillion a year of losses to ecosystem services due to land use change some pes programs involve contracts between consumers of ecosystem services and the suppliers of these services however the majority of the pes programs are funded by governments and involve intermediaries such as non-government organisations the party supplying the environmental services normally holds the property rights over an environmental good that provides a flow of benefits to the demanding party in return for compensation in the case of private contracts the beneficiaries of the ecosystem services are willing to pay a price that can be expected to be lower than their welfare gain due to the services the providers of the ecosystem services can be expected to be willing to accept a payment that is greater than the cost of providing the services organizations and motives for incentivizing production of ecosystem services though the goal of all pes programs is the procurement of some sort of ecosystem service the reasons why organizations or governments would incentivize the production of these services are diverse for example the worlds largest and longest running pes program is the united states conservation reserve program which pays about 1.8 billion a year under 766,000 contracts with farmers and landowners to “rent” a total 34,700,000 acres 140,000 km of what it considers “environmentally-sensitive land.” these farmers agree to plant “long-term resource-conserving covers to improve water quality control soil erosion and enhance habitats for waterfowl and wildlife.” this program has existed in some form or another since the wake of the american dust bowl when the federal government began paying farmers to avoid farming on poor quality erodible land in 1999 the chinese central government announced an even more expensive project under its 43 billion grain for green program by which it offers farmers grain in exchange for not clearing forested slopes for farming thereby reducing erosion and saving the streams and rivers below from the associated deluge of sedimentation notably some sources cite the cost of the entire program at 95 billion many less extensive nationally funded pes projects which bear resemblances to the american and chinese land set-aside programs exist around the world including programs in canada the eu japan and switzerland additional examples in jesús de otoro honduras the cumes river is the town’s main source of clean water coffee producers were dumping their waste into the river upstream polluting the source and directly affecting the consumers downstream to solve this problem the local council for administration of water and sewage disposal japoe created a payment program to benefit coffee producers upstream and the town’s inhabitants who lived downstream the villagers downstream paid around 0.06 per household per month to japoe who redirected the money toward the upstream farmers the farmers complied with guidelines such as construction of irrigation ditches proper management of waste and use of organic fertilizers in jamestown rhode island united states farmers usually harvest the hay in their fields twice a year however this practice destroys the habitats of many local grassland birds economists from the university of rhode island and ecoassets markets inc raised money from residents of jamestown who were willing to help the birds the range of investments was between 5 and 200 per person for a total of 9,800 this money was enough to compensate three jamestown farms for the cost of reducing their yearly harvests and getting their hay from another source in this way the birds have sufficient time to nest and leave the grounds without being subject to a hay harvest in this example the farmers benefit because they only have to harvest their fields once a year instead of twice and the contributors benefit because they value the lives of the birds more than the money they contributed to the project the scolel té program in chiapas mexico aims to create a market for positive externalities of shade-grown coffee plantations designed by the university of edinburgh’s institute of ecology and resource management along with the edinburgh centre for carbon management using the plan vivo system scolel té is a pes program under which farmers agree to responsible farming and reforestation practices in exchange for payment for carbon offsets the ngo ambio manages scolel té farmers submit their reforestation plans to ambio which judges their financial benefits and the amount of carbon sequestration associated with each plan the farmers then receive payments from the fondo bioclimatico managed by ambio funding for the fondo bioclimatico comes from the sale of voluntary emissions reduction vers to private groups at a price of 13 per ton of carbon sequestered pico bonito forests near la ceiba honduras is a mission-driven for-profit venture between the pico bonito national park foundation and the ecologic development fund carbon credits are generated by planting native trees to capture or sequester carbon dioxide the credits are then sold though the world bank’s biocarbon fund to countries aiming to meet their carbon emissions reduction targets the project offers a unique business model because it is owned jointly by investors and the communities near the park community members earn income and share profits from implementing the sustainable forestry practices that capture carbon by 2017 the project is expected to sequester from 45-.55 mt of carbon through reforestation and agroforestry and up to an additional 5 mt of carbon through avoided deforestation as destructive practices are replaced with sustainable practices costa rica has started programs under fundecor an ngo and the ministry of environment and energy in order to protect natural resources it began to develop in 1996 with the costa rican forestry law the costa rican government implemented laws to ensure that a new concept could become a part of their market place the idea that market incentives can be implemented to protect natural resources because ecosystem services have inherent value the law 7575 took into account the value of carbon fixation hydrological services biodiversity protection and provision of scenic beauty people were able to receive tax breaks for protecting services through the new laws the private forestry project was created forming costa ricas first project to reward carbon sequestration on private land the protected areas project created the ability to transfer private land into parkland fundecor worked with the national fund for forestry financing fonafifo to set up an institution that could manage small and medium-sized forests some of the main goals are to create programs for the smaller farmers through advanced payment for woods sustainable forest harvesting reforestation projects getting farmers the best prices for their wood performing environmental education and helping to develop property rights of forest workers by registering their properties on the national register property fundecor.org since in this case the pes project sets up systems for those with little money to get land titles and use natural resources to join the economy in a sustainable manner it has proved successful in creating a pathway out of poverty for many individuals by giving them property rights it does require that the country has a stable government to implement these types of plans but it is an effective way to include natural resources into the price of markets giving people incentives to protect their environment criticism commodification of natural capital results in undervaluing ecological systems by not accounting for the innumerable wide-range services provided pes may decrease in utility as 1 wealth becomes concentrated to the point that natural resource scarcity results in higher short-term value for unsustainable resource extraction and 2 the long-term cost to engineer limited-range replacement services is externalized onto citizens this occurs either through increased expense to the existing systems or as justification to privatize services for further profit for example a parent corporation can profit both from the exploitation of an ecosystem and by engineering and operating the services formerly provided alternative examples salt lake city utah united states has managed the majority of its watershed since the 1850s through multi-jurisdictional regulatory mechanisms such as specifying allowable uses and restricting them and purchasing land or conservation easements this long-standing legally-defensible yet often-overlooked strategy preserves ecosystem services while still allowing widely utilized recreation including skiing snowboarding hiking mountain biking and fishing existing uses of the land are generally unaffected and commercial enterprises are restricted to no or low-impact tourism-related activities further reading cacho oscar marshall graham milne
