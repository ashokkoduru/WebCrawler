solar water disinfection sodis is a type of portable water purification that uses solar energy to make biologically-contaminated e.g bacteria viruses protozoa and worms water safe to drink water contaminated with non-biological agents such as toxic chemicals or heavy metals require additional steps to make the water safe to drink solar water disinfection is usually accomplished using some mix of electricity generated by photovoltaic panels solar pv heat solar thermal and solar ultraviolet light collection solar disinfection using the effects of electricity generated by photovoltaics typically uses an electric current to deliver electrolytic processes which disinfect water for example by generating oxidative free radicals which kill pathogens by damaging their chemical structure a second approach uses stored solar electricity from a battery and operates at night or at low light levels to power an ultraviolet lamp to perform secondary solar ultraviolet water disinfection solar thermal water disinfection uses heat from the sun to heat water to 70–100 °c for a short period of time a number of approaches exist here solar heat collectors can have lenses in front of them or use reflectors they may also use varying levels of insulation or glazing in addition some solar thermal water disinfection processes are batch-based while others through-flow solar thermal disinfection operate almost continuously while the sun shines water heated to temperatures below 100 °c is generally referred to as pasteurized water the ultraviolet part of sunlight can also kill pathogens in water the sodis method uses a combination of uv light and increased temperature solar thermal for disinfecting water using only sunlight and pet plastic bottles sodis is a free and effective method for decentralized water treatment usually applied at the household level and is recommended by the world health organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage sodis is already applied in numerous developing countries educational pamphlets on the method are available in many languages each equivalent to the english-language version principle of sodis exposure to sunlight has been shown to deactivate diarrhea-causing organisms in polluted drinking water the inactivation of pathogenic organisms is attributed to the uv-a wavelength 320–400 nm part of the sunlight which reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides that damage pathogens while it also interferes with metabolism and destroys bacterial cell structures and simultaneously the full band of solar energy from infrared to uv heats the water at a water temperature of about 30 °c 86 °f a threshold solar irradiance of at least 500 wm all spectral light is required for about 5 hours for sodis to be efficient this dose contains energy of 555 whm in the range of uv-a and violet light 350–450 nm corresponding to about 6 hours of mid-latitude european midday summer sunshine at water temperatures higher than 45 °c 113 °f synergistic effects of uv radiation and temperature further enhance the disinfection efficiency above 50 °c 122 °f the bacterial count drops three times faster process for household application guides for the household use of sodis describe the process colourless transparent pet water or pop bottles of 2 litre or smaller size with few surface scratches are selected for use glass bottles are unsuitable as they block uv-a any labels are removed and the bottles are washed before the first use water from possibly-contaminated sources is filled into the bottles using the clearest water possible where the turbidity is higher than 30 ntu it is necessary to filter or precipitate out particulates prior to exposure to the sunlight filters are locally made from cloth stretched over inverted bottles with the bottoms cut off in order to improve oxygen saturation the guides recommend that bottles be filled three-quarters shaken for 20 seconds with the cap on then filled completely recapped and checked for clarity the filled bottles are then exposed to the fullest sunlight possible bottles will heat faster and hotter if they are placed on a sloped sun-facing reflective metal surface a corrugated metal roof as compared to thatched roof or a slightly curved sheet of aluminum foil increases the light inside the bottle overhanging structures or plants that shade the bottles must be avoided as they reduce both illumination and heating after sufficient time the treated water can be consumed directly from the bottle or poured into clean drinking cups the risk of re-contamination is minimized if the water is stored in the bottles refilling and storage in other containers increases the risk of contamination the most favorable regions for application of the sodis method are located between latitude 15°n and 35°n and also 15°s and 35°s these regions have high levels of solar radiation with limited cloud cover and rainfall and with over 90 of sunlight reaching the earths surface as direct radiation the second most favorable region lies between latitudes 15°n and 15°s these regions have high levels of scattered radiation with about 2500 hours of sunshine annually due to high humidity and frequent cloud cover local education in the use of sodis is important to avoid confusion between pet and other bottle materials applying sodis without proper assessment or with false assessment of existing hygienic practices diarrhea incidence may not address other routes of infection community trainers must themselves be trained first applications sodis is an effective method for treating water where fuel or cookers are unavailable or prohibitively expensive even where fuel is available sodis is a more economical and environmentally friendly option the application of sodis is limited if enough bottles are not available or if the water is highly turbid in fact if the water is highly turbid sodis cannot be used alone additional filtering is then necessary a basic field test to determine if the water is too turbid for the sodis method to work properly is the newspaper test for the newspaper test place the filled bottle upright on top of a newspaper headline look down through the bottle opening if the letters of the headline are readable the water can be used for the sodis method if the letters are not readable then the turbidity of the water likely exceeds 30 ntu and the water must be pretreated in theory the method could be used in disaster relief or refugee camps however supplying bottles may be more difficult than providing equivalent disinfecting tablets containing chlorine bromine or iodine in addition in some circumstances it may be difficult to guarantee that the water will be left in the sun for the necessary time other methods for household water treatment and safe storage exist e.g chlorination different filtration procedures or flocculationdisinfection the selection of the adequate method should be based on the criteria of effectiveness the co-occurrence of other types of pollution turbidity chemical pollutants treatment costs labor input and convenience and the user’s preference when the water is highly turbid sodis cannot be used alone additional filtering or flocculation is then necessary to clarify the water prior to sodis treatment recent work has shown that common table salt nacl is an effective flocculation agent for decreasing turbidity for the sodis method in some types of soil this method could be used to increase the geographic areas for which the sodis method could be used as regions with highly turbid water could be treated for low costs sodis may alternatively be implemented using plastic bags sodis bags have been found to yield as much as 74 higher treatment efficiencies than sodis bottles which may be because the bags are able to reach elevated temperatures that cause accelerated treatment sodis bags with a water layer of approximately 1 cm to 6 cm reach higher temperatures more easily than sodis bottles and treat vibrio cholerae more effectively it is assumed this is because of the improved surface area to volume ratio in sodis bags in remote regions plastic bottles are not locally available and need to be shipped in from urban centers which may be expensive and inefficient since bottles cannot be packed very tightly bags can be packed more densely than bottles and can be shipped at lower cost representing an economically preferable alternative to sodis bottles in remote communities the disadvantages of using bags are that they can give the water a plastic smell they are more difficult to handle when filled with water and they typically require that the water be transferred to a second container for drinking another important benefit in using the sodis bottles as opposed to the bags or other methods requiring the water to be transferred to a smaller container for consumption is that the bottles are a point-of-use household water treatment method point-of-use means that the water is treated in the same easy to handle container it will be served from thus decreasing the risk of secondary water contamination cautions if the water bottles are not left in the sun for the proper length of time the water may not be safe to drink and could cause illness if the sunlight is less strong due to overcast weather or a less sunny climate a longer exposure time in the sun is necessary the following issues should also be considered health impact diarrhea reduction according to the world health organization more than two million people per year die of preventable water-borne diseases and one billion people lack access to a source of improved drinking water it has been shown that the sodis method and other methods of household water treatment can very effectively remove pathogenic contamination from the water however infectious diseases are also transmitted through other pathways i.e due to a general lack of sanitation and hygiene studies on the reduction of diarrhea among sodis users show reduction values of 30–80 research the effectiveness of the sodis was first discovered by aftim acra of the american university of beirut in the early 1980s follow-up was conducted by the research groups of martin wegelin at the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag and kevin mcguigan at the royal college of surgeons in ireland clinical control trials were pioneered by ronan conroy of the rcsi team in collaboration with michael elmore-meegan.icross a joint research project on sodis was implemented by the following institutions royal college of surgeons in ireland rcsi ireland coordination university of ulster uu united kingdom csir environmentek south africa eawag switzerland the institute of water and sanitation development iwsd zimbabwe plataforma solar de almería ciemat-psa spain university of leicester ul united kingdom the international commission for the relief of suffering and starvation icross kenya university of santiago de compostela usc spain swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag switzerland the project embarked on a multi-country study including study areas in zimbabwe south africa and kenya other developments include the development of a continuous flow disinfection unit and solar disinfection with titanium dioxide film over glass cylinders which prevents the bacterial regrowth of coliforms after sodis research has shown that a number of low-cost additives are capable of accelerating sodis and that additives might make sodis more rapid and effective in both sunny and cloudy weather developments that could help make the technology more effective and acceptable to users a 2008 study showed that powdered seeds of five natural legumes peas beans and lentils—vigna unguiculata cowpea phaseolus mungo black lentil glycine max soybean pisum sativum green pea and arachis hypogaea peanut—when evaluated as natural flocculants for the removal of turbidity were as effective as commercial alum and even superior for clarification in that the optimum dosage was low 1 gl flocculation was rapid 7–25 minutes depending on the seed used and the water hardness and ph was essentially unaltered later studies have used chestnuts oak acorns and moringa oleifera drumstick tree for the same purpose other research has examined the use of doped semiconductors to increase the production of oxygen radicals under solar uv-a recently researchers at the national centre for sensor research and the biomedical diagnostics institute at dublin city university have developed an inexpensive printable uv dosimeter for sodis applications that can be read using a mobile phone the camera of the phone is used to acquire an image of the sensor and custom software running on the phone analyses the sensor colour to provide a quantitative measurement of uv dose in isolated regions the effect of wood smoke increases lung disease due to the constant need for building fires to boil water and cook research groups have found that boiling of water is neglected due to the difficulty of gathering wood which is scarce in many areas when presented with basic household water treatment options residents in isolated regions in africa have shown a preference for the sodis method over boiling or other basic water treatment methods promotion the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag through the department of water and sanitation in developing countries sandec coordinates sodis promotion projects in 33 countries including bhutan bolivia burkina faso cambodia cameroon dr congo ecuador el salvador ethiopia ghana guatemala guinea honduras india indonesia kenya laos malawi mozambique nepal nicaragua pakistan perú philippines senegal sierra leone sri lanka togo uganda uzbekistan vietnam zambia and zimbabwe sodis projects are funded by among others the solaqua foundation several lions clubs rotary clubs migros and the michel comte water foundation sodis has also been applied in several communities in brazil one of them being prainha do canto verde beberibe west of fortaleza villagers there using the sodis method have been quite successful since the temperature during the day can go beyond 40 °c 104 °f and there is a limited amount of shade one of the most important things to consider for public health workers reaching out to communities in need of suitable cost efficient and sustainable water treatment methods is teaching the importance of water quality in the context of health promotion and disease prevention while educating about the methods themselves although skepticism has posed a challenge in some communities to adopt sodis and other household water treatment methods for daily use disseminating knowledge on the important health benefits associated with these methods will likely increase adoption rates see also appropriate technology ultraviolet germicidal irradiation water pasteurization indicator external links sodis
