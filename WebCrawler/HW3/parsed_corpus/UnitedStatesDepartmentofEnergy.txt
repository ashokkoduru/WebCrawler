the u.s army corps of engineers after the war in 1946 the atomic energy commission aec was created to control the future of the project in 1974 the aec gave way to the nuclear regulatory commission which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry and the energy research and development administration which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon naval reactor and energy development programs the 1973 oil crisis called attention to the need to consolidate energy policy on august 4 1977 president jimmy carter signed into law the department of energy organization act of 1977 pub.l 95–91 91 stat. 565 enacted august 4 1977 which created the department of energy the new agency which began operations on october 1 1977 consolidated the federal energy administration the energy research and development administration the federal power commission and programs of various other agencies former secretary of defense james schlesinger who served under presidents nixon and ford during the vietnam war was appointed as the first secretary weapon plans stolen main article wen ho lee in december 1999 the fbi was investigating how china obtained plans for a specific nuclear device wen ho lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from los alamos national laboratory for the peoples republic of china federal officials including then-energy secretary bill richardson publicly named lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime the u s congress held hearings to investigate the department of energys mishandling of his case republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues not the department of energy all but one of the 59 charges against lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the chinese obtained could not have come from lee lee filed suit and won a 1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies organization the department is under the control and supervision of a united states secretary of energy a political appointee of the president of the united states the energy secretary is assisted in managing the

office of energy efficiency and renewable energy eere the budget aims to substantially expand the use of renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure it also makes significant investments in hybrids and plug-in hybrids in smart grid technologies and in scientific research and innovation as part of the 789 billion economic stimulus package in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 congress provided energy with an additional 38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 adding about 75 percent to energys annual budgets most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts for fiscal year 2013 each of the operating units of the department of energy operate with the following budgets energy savings performance contract main article energy savings performance contract energy savings performance contracts espcs are contracts under which a contractor designs constructs and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agencys utility bills the contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings and after the contract ends all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency loan guarantee program main article loan guarantee title xvii of energy policy act of 2005 authorizes the doe to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that avoid reduce or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the united states at the time the guarantee is issued in loan guarantees a conditional commitment requires to meet an equity commitment as well as other conditions before the loan guarantee is completed energy innovation hubs energy innovation hubs are multi-disciplinary meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies the consortium for advanced simulation of light water reactors casl was the first doe energy innovation hub established in july 2010 for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation ms solutions for commercial nuclear reactors the doe budget includes 280 million to fund eight energy innovation hubs each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge two of the eight hubs are included in the eere budget and will focus on integrating smart materials designs and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity another two hubs included in the doe office of science budget will tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes yet another hub will develop smart materials that will allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions in 2012 the doe awarded 120 million to the ames laboratory to start a new eih the critical materials institute which will focus on improving the supply of rare earth elements which is controlled by china list of secretaries of energy symbolism in the seal excerpt from the code of federal regulations title 10 energy the official seal of the department of energy includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo it is crested by the white head of an eagle atop a white rope both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency in gold appears on a green background the eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the nations increasing demands for energy the sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands the rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities the lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the nations challenge in harnessing the forces the color scheme is derived from nature symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of mans existence the blue field represents air and water green represents mineral resources and the earth itself and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces by invoking this symbolism the color scheme represents the nations commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with
