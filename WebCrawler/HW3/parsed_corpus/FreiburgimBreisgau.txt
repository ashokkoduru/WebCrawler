founded by konrad and duke berthold iii of zähringen in 1120 as a free market town hence its name which translates to free or independent town frei means free and burg like the modern english word borough was used in those days for an incorporated city or town usually one with some degree of autonomy the german word burg also means a fortified town as in hamburg thus it is likely that the name of this place means a fortified town of free citizens this town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the mediterranean sea and the north sea regions and the rhine and danube rivers in 1200 freiburgs population numbered approximately 6,000 people at about that time under the rule of bertold v the last duke of zähringen the city began construction of its freiburg münster cathedral on the site of an older parish church begun in the romanesque style it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a gothic edifice in 1218 when bertold v died the counts of urach assumed the title of freiburgs count the city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document at the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of freiburg and their lord count egino ii of freiburg egino raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens freedom after which the freiburgers used catapults to destroy the counts castle atop the schloßberg a hill that overlooks the city center the furious count called on his brother-in-law the bishop of strasbourg konradius von lichtenberg for help the bishop responded by marching with his army to freiburg according to an old freiburg legend a butcher named hauri stabbed the bishop of strasbourg to death on 29 july 1299 it was a pyrrhic victory since henceforth the citizens of freiburg had to pay an annual expiation of 300 marks in silver to the count of freiburg until 1368 in 1366 the counts of freiburg made another failed attempt to occupy the city during a night raid eventually the citizens were fed up with their lords and in 1368 freiburg purchased its independence from them the city turned itself over to the protection of the habsburgs who allowed the city to retain a large measure of freedom most of the nobles of the city died in the battle of sempach 1386 the patrician family schnewlin took control of the city until the guildsmen revolted the guilds became more powerful than the patricians by 1389 the silver mines in mount schauinsland provided an important source of capital for freiburg this silver made freiburg one of the richest cities in europe and in 1327 freiburg minted its own coin the rappenpfennig in 1377 the cities of freiburg basel colmar and breisach entered into an alliance known as the genossenschaft des rappenpfennigs

and fourteenth centuries and 30 churches and monasteries at the end of the fourteenth century the veins of silver were dwindling and by 1460 only approximately 6,000 people still lived within

between city traditions and old roman law the reforms were well received especially the sections dealing with civil process law punishment and the citys constitution in 1520 freiburg decided not to take part in the reformation and became an important centre for catholicism on the upper rhine in 1536 a strong and persistent belief in witchcraft led to the citys first witch-hunt the need to find a scapegoat for calamities such as the black plague which claimed 2,000 area residents 25 of the city population in 1564 led to an escalation in witch-hunting that reached its peak in 1599 a plaque on
