function mftempopensectionidvar blockdocument.getelementbyidmf-section-idblock.classname open-blockblock.previoussibling.classname open-block i pat is the lettering of a formula put forward to describe the impact of human activity on the environment in words the equation was developed in the 1970s during the course of a debate between barry commoner paul r ehrlich and john holdren commoner argued that environmental impacts in the united states were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following world war ii while ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human population growth the equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment but it has also been cited as one of the primary factors underlying many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by paul ehrlich george wald denis hayes lester brown rené dubos and sidney ripley that did not come to pass neal koblitz classified equations of this type as mathematical propaganda and criticized ehrlichs use of them in the media e.g on the tonight show to sway the general public the kaya identity is closely related to the i pat equation the i pat equation is more general describing an abstract impact the kaya identity describes more clearly the impact of human activity on co2 emissions population see also world population and human overpopulation in the ipat equation the variable p represents the population of an area such as the world since the rise of industrial societies human population has been increasing exponentially this has caused thomas malthus and many others to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine see malthusian growth model the united nations and the us census bureau project that world population will increase from 7.4 billion today in 2016 up from 7.0 billion forecast in 2005 to about 9.7 billion by 2050 up from 9.2 billion these projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children this phenomenon is the result of demographic transition all over the world the un projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion by 2100 up from 9.2 billion however since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades this factor of the ipat equation will likely keep increasing human impact on the environment for the near future environmental impacts increased population increases humans environmental impact in many ways which include but are not limited to increased land use  results in habitat loss for other species increased resource use  results in changes in land cover increased pollution  can cause sickness and damages ecosystems affluence main article consumption economics the variable a in the ipat equation stands for affluence it represents the average consumption of each person in the population as the consumption of each person increases the total environmental impact increases as well a common proxy for measuring consumption is through gdp per capita while gdp per capita measures production it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases gdp per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the ipat equation environmental impacts increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact this is because each product consumed has wide ranging effects on the environment for example if the construction of a car had the following environmental impacts among others 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires 682 lbs of pollution at a mine for the lead battery 2178 lbs of discharge into water supply for the 22 lbs of copper contained in the car then the more cars per capita the greater the impact since the ecological impacts of each product are far reaching increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment technology see also environmental technology and appropriate technology the t variable in the ipat equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is how much environmental impact is involved in creating transporting and disposing of the goods services and amenities used improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness reducing the t multiplier since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways the unit for t is often tailored for the situation ipat is being applied to for example for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured an appropriate unit for t might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp environmental impacts increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact however since p has increased exponentially and a has also increased drastically the overall environmental impact i has still increased reception the ipat equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that p a and t are independent of each other in reality at least 7 interdependencies between p a and t could exist indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as i fp,a,t for example a doubling of technological efficiency or equivalently a reduction of the t-factor by 50 does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact i by 50 if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved a phenomenon called the rebound effect conservation or jevons paradox as was shown by alcott despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of gdp i.e the efficiency in carbon use since 1980 world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth similarly an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy and materials use efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution as a result of the interdependencies between p a and t and potential rebound effects policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in p a and t may not only be very difficult to implement i.e population control and material sufficiency and degrowth movements have been very controversial but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing i.e quotas or pigouvian taxation of resource use or pollution see also
