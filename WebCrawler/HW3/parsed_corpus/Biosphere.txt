for other uses see biosphere disambiguation the biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems the two joined words are bio and sphere it can also be termed as the zone of life on earth a closed system apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the earth and largely self-regulating by the most general biophysiological definition the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere the biosphere is postulated to have evolved beginning with a process of biopoesis life created naturally from non-living matter such as simple organic compounds or biogenesis life created from living matter at least some 3.5 billion years ago the earliest evidence for life on earth includes biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from western greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from western australia more recently in 2015 remains of biotic life were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia according to one of the researchers if life arose relatively quickly on earth  then it could be common in the universe in a general sense biospheres are any closed self-regulating systems containing ecosystems this includes artificial biospheres such as biosphere 2 and bios-3 and potentially ones on other planets or moons origin and use of the term the term biosphere was coined by geologist eduard suess in 1875 which he defined as the place on earths surface where life dwells while the concept has a geological origin it is an indication of the effect of both charles darwin and matthew f maury on the earth sciences the biospheres ecological context comes from the 1920s see vladimir i vernadsky preceding the 1935 introduction of the term ecosystem by sir arthur tansley see ecology history vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere it is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy geophysics meteorology biogeography evolution geology geochemistry hydrology and generally speaking all life and earth sciences narrow definition geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms the biomass or biota as referred to by biologists and ecologists in this sense the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model the other three being geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere when these four component spheres are combined into one system it is known as the ecosphere this term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet the second international conference on closed life systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and models of earths biosphere i.e artificial earth-like biospheres others may include the creation of artificial non-earth biospheres—for example human-centered biospheres or a native martian biosphere—as part of the topic of biospherics extent of earths biosphere life timeline view • discuss • edit 4500 — – 4000 — – 3500 — – 3000 — – 2500 — – 2000 — – 1500 — – 1000 — –

demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the earths terrestrial surface and that the total mass of microbial life in so-called uninhabitable zones may in biomass exceed all animal and plant life on the surface the actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1,800 m 5,900 ft 1.1 mi and fish live as much as 8,372 m 27,467 ft

these elevations depend on lichens grasses and herbs microscopic organisms live in every part of the biosphere including soil hot springs seven miles deep in the ocean 40 miles high in the atmosphere and inside rocks far down within the earths crust see also endolith microorganisms under certain test conditions have been observed to thrive in the vacuum of outer space the total amount of soil and subsurface bacterial carbon is estimated as 5 x 10 g or the weight of the united kingdom the mass of prokaryote microorganisms — which includes bacteria and archaea but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms — may be as much as 0.8 trillion tons of carbon of the total biosphere mass estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons barophilic marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10,000 m 33,000 ft 6.2 mi in the mariana trench the deepest spot in the earths oceans in fact single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the mariana trench by the challenger deep at depths of 11,034 m 36,201 ft 6.856 mi other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580 m 1,900 ft 0.36 mi below the sea floor under 2,590 m 8,500 ft

temperature increases depends on many factors including type of crust continental vs oceanic rock type geographic location etc the greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122 °c 252 °f methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 and it is likely that the limit of life in the deep biosphere is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth on 20 august 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800 m 2,600 ft 0.50 mi below the ice of antarctica according to one researcher you can find microbes everywhere — theyre extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are our biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna on land biomes are separated primarily by latitude terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic and antarctic circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator specific biospheres for this list if a word is followed by a number it is usually referring to a specific system or number thus biosphere 1 the planet earth biosphere 2 laboratory in arizona united states which contains 3.15 acres 13,000 m of

in japan extraterrestrial biospheres no biospheres have been detected beyond the earth therefore the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical the rare earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare save ones composed of microbial life only on the other hand earth analogs may be quite numerous at least in the milky way galaxy given limited understanding of abiogenesis it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres it is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future for example on mars the process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of earths biosphere is called terraforming see also environment portal ecology portal earth sciences portal sustainable development portal
