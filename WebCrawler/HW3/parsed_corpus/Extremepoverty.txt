extreme poverty absolute poverty destitution or penury was originally defined by the united nations in 1995 as a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs including food safe drinking water sanitation facilities health shelter education and information it depends not only on income but also on access to services in 2008 extreme poverty widely refers to earning below the international poverty line of 1.25day in 2005 prices set by the world bank this measure is the equivalent to earning 1.00 a day in 1996 us prices hence the widely used expression living on less than a dollar a day the vast majority of those in extreme poverty – 96 – reside in south asia sub-saharan africa the west indies east asia and the pacific nearly half live in india and china alone the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger was the first millennium development goal mdg1 as set by 189 united nations member states in 2000 specifically mdg1 set a target of reducing the extreme poverty rate in half by 2015 a goal that was met 5 years ahead of schedule this goal was created to end poverty in all its forms everywhere and the international community including the un the world bank and the united states has set a target of ending extreme poverty by 2030 defining extreme poverty income-based definition extreme poverty is defined by the international community as earning less than a 1.25 a day as measured in 2005 international prices originally the international poverty line was set at earning a 1 a day when the millennium development goals were first published however in 2008 the world bank pushed the line to 1.25 to recognize higher price levels in several developing countries than previously estimated as of september 2010 the most recent reliable date according to the un roughly 1.2 billion people remain in extreme poverty based on this metric despite the significant number of individuals still earning below the international poverty line this figure represents significant progress for the international community as this number is 700 million fewer than the number living in extreme poverty in 1990 – 1.9 billion as highlighted in the next section though there are many criticisms of a purely income-based approach to measuring extreme poverty the 1.25day line remains the most widely used metric as it is easily accessible to the public at large and draws attention to those in the direst need on september 23 2015 the uk-based financial times reported that the world bank intends to revise its income-based benchmark upward to 1.90 a day as a result poverty numbers are likely to swell according to the paper common criticismalternatives though widely used by most international organizations the 1.25day extreme poverty line has come under scrutiny from a variety of factors for example when used to measure headcount ratio i.e the percentage of people living below the line the 1.25day line is unable to capture other important measures such as depth of poverty relative poverty and how people view their own financial situation known as the socially subjective poverty line moreover the calculation of the poverty line relies on several debatable assumptions about purchasing power parity homogeneity of household size and makeup and consumer prices used to determine a basket of essential goods not to mention the fact that there may be missing data from the poorest and most fragile countries which may muddle the picture even further to address these problems several alternative instruments for measuring extreme poverty have been suggested which incorporate other factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to a basic education thus the 2010 human development report introduced the multidimensional poverty index mpi which measures not only income but also basic needs using this tool the united nations development programme undp estimated that roughly 1.5 billion people remained in extreme poverty as opposed to the conventional figure of 1.2 billion as this figure is considered more holistic it may shed new light on relative deprivation within a country for example in ethiopia 39 of the population is considered extremely poor under conventional measures but 90 are in multidimensional poverty another version of the mpi known as the alkire-foster method created by sabina alkire and james foster of the oxford poverty human development initiative ophi can be broken down to reflect both the incidence and the intensity of poverty this tool is useful as development officials using the m0 measure of the method which is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived can determine the most likely causes of poverty within a region for example in the gaza strip of palestine using the m0 measure of the alkire-foster method reveals that poverty in the region is primarily caused by a lack of access to electricity and drinking water in addition to widespread overcrowding in contrast data from the chhukha district of bhutan reveals that income is a much larger contributor to poverty as opposed to other dimensions within the region current trends getting to zero using the world bank definition of 1.25day as of september 2013 roughly 1.3 billion people remain in extreme poverty nearly half live in india and china with more than 85 living in just 20 countries since the mid-1990s there has been a steady decline in both the worldwide poverty rate and the total number of extreme poor in 1990 the percentage of the global population living in extreme poverty was 43.1 but in 2011 that percentage had dropped down to 20.6 this halving of the extreme poverty rate falls in line with the first millennium development goal mdg1 proposed by former un secretary-general kofi annan who called on the international community at the turn of the century to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty…by 2015 this reduction in extreme poverty took place most notably in china indonesia india pakistan and vietnam these five countries accounted for the alleviation of 715 million people out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2010 – more than the global net total of roughly 700 million this statistical oddity can be explained by the fact that the number of people living in extreme poverty in sub-saharan africa rose from 290 million to 414 million over the same period however there have been many positive signs for extensive global poverty reduction as well since 1999 the total number of extreme poor has declined by 50 million per year on average moreover in 2005 for the first time in recorded history poverty rates began to fall in every region of the world including africa although this is largely due to a change in the 2000 un millennium declaration extending the plan period backward to 1990 it was previously 1996 changing the date took advantage of rapid population growth and a huge poverty reduction in china during the 1990s as aforementioned the number of people living in extreme poverty has reduced from 1.9 billion to 1.2 billion over the span of the last 20–25 years if we remain on our current trajectory many economists predict we could reach global zero by 2030-2035 thus ending extreme poverty global zero entails a world in which fewer than 3 of the global population lives in extreme poverty projected under most optimistic scenarios to be fewer than 200 million people this zero figure is set at 3 in recognition of the fact that some amount of frictional poverty will continue to exist whether it is caused by political conflict or unexpected economic fluctuations at least for the foreseeable future however the brookings institution notes that any projection about poverty more than a few years into the future runs the risk of being highly uncertain this is because changes in consumption and distribution throughout the developing world over the next two decades could result in monumental shifts in global poverty for better or worse others are more pessimistic about this possibility with many predicting a range of 193 million to 660 million people living in extreme poverty by 2035 additionally some believe the rate of poverty reduction will slow down in the developing world especially in africa and as such it will take closer to five decades to reach global zero despite these reservations several prominent international and national organizations including the un the world bank and the united states federal government via usaid have set a target of reaching global zero by the end of 2030 exacerbating factors there are a variety of factors that may reinforce or instigate the existence of extreme poverty such as weak institutions cycles of violence and a low level of growth recent world bank research shows that some countries can get caught in a fragility trap in which the above factors prevent the poorest nations from emerging from low-level equilibrium in the long run moreover most of the reduction in extreme poverty over the past twenty years has taken place in countries that have not experienced a civil conflict or have had governing institutions with a strong capacity to actually govern thus to end extreme poverty it is also important to focus on the interrelated problems of fragility and conflict usaid defines fragility as a governments lack of both legitimacy the perception the government is adequate at doing its job and effectiveness how good the government is at maintaining law and order in an equitable manner as fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality additionally in countries with high levels of inequality a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations not to mention after removing china and india from the equation up to 70 of the worlds poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility looking further some analysts project extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in fragile low-income states like haiti yemen and the central african republic over the coming years however some academics such as andy sumner assert that extreme poverty will be increasingly found concentrated in middle income countries creating a poverty paradox—as the worlds poor dont actually live in the poorest countries despite this debate addressing the problem of fragility remains a very real issue to help low-income fragile states make the transition towards peace and prosperity the new deal for engagement in fragile states endorsed by roughly forty countries and multilateral institutions was created in 2011 this new deal represents an important step towards redressing the problem of fragility as it was originally articulated by self-identified fragile states who called on the international community to not only do things differently but to also do different things on the other hand civil conflict also remains a prime cause for the perpetuation of poverty throughout the developing world armed conflict can have severe effects on economic growth for a plethora of reasons – it destroys assets creates unwanted mass migration destroys livelihoods and diverts public resources towards war fighting significantly a country that experienced major violence during 1981-2005 had extreme poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than a country with no violence on average a civil conflict will also cost a country roughly 30 years of gdp growth therefore a renewed commitment from the international community to address the deteriorating situation in highly fragile states is necessary to both prevent the mass loss of life but to also prevent the vicious cycle of extreme poverty in 2013 a prevalent finding in a report by the the world bank was that extreme poverty is most prevalent in what they call low income countries in these countries the world bank found that progress in poverty reduction is slowest the poor live under terrible conditions and the most affected persons are children aging 12 and under international conferences millennium summit on september 6-8th 2000 world leaders gathered at the millennium summit held in new york launching the united nations millennium project suggested by then un secretary-general kofi annan prior to the launch of the conference the office of secretary-general annan released a report entitled we the peoples the role of the united nations in the 21st century in this document now widely known as the millennium report kofi annan called on the international community to adopt the target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and so lifting more than 1 billion people out of it by 2015 citing studies that show an almost perfect correlation between growth and poverty reduction in poor countries annan urged international leaders to indiscriminately target the problem of extreme poverty across every region in charge of managing the project was jeffrey sachs a noted development economist who in 2005 released a plan for action called investing in development a practical plan to achieve the millennium development goals 2005 world summit the 2005 world summit held on september 14-16th was organized to measure international progress towards fulfilling the millennium development goals mdgs notably the conference brought together more than 170 heads of state while world leaders at the summit were encouraged by the reduction of poverty in some nations they were concerned by the uneven decline of poverty within and among different regions of the globe however at the end of the summit the conference attendees reaffirmed the uns commitment to achieve the mdgs by 2015 and urged all supranational national and non-governmental organizations to follow suit post-2015 development agenda with the expiration of the millennium development goals approaching in 2015 the international community is focused on accelerating efforts to achieve the goals laid out in the original mdgs overall there has been significant progress towards reducing extreme poverty with the mdg 1 target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline…700 million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty in 2010 than in 1990 however at the global level 1.2 billion people were still living in extreme poverty one notable exception to this trend was in sub-saharan africa the only region where the number of people living in extreme poverty rose from 290 million in 1990 to 414 million in 2010 comprising more than a third of those living in extreme poverty worldwide with the aforementioned in mind the un convened a high level panel hlp of eminent persons to advise on a post-2015 development agenda the hlp report entitled a new global partnership eradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable development was published in may 2013 in the report the hlp wrote that ending extreme poverty is just the beginning not the end it is vital but our vision must be broader to start countries on the path of sustainable development – building on the foundations established by the 2012 un conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro12 and meeting a challenge that no country developed or developing has met so far we recommend to the secretary-general that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty once and for all in the context of sustainable development thus the report determined that a central goal of the post-millennium development agenda is to eradicate extreme poverty…by 2030 however the report also emphasized that the mdgs were not enough as they did not focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on development…the importance to development of good governance and institution…nor the need for inclusive growth consequently there now exists synergy between the policy position papers put forward by the united states through usaid the world bank and the un itself in terms of viewing fragility and a lack of good governance as exacerbating extreme poverty however in a departure from the views of other organizations the commission also proposed that the un focus not only on extreme poverty a line drawn at 1.25 but also on a higher target such as 2 the report notes this change could be made to reflect the fact that escaping extreme poverty is only a start in addition to the un a host of other supranational and national actors such as the european union and the african union have published their own positions or recommendations on what should be incorporated in the post-2015 agenda the european commissions communication published in a decent life for all from vision to collective action affirmed the uns commitment to eradicate extreme poverty in our lifetime and put the world on a sustainable path to ensure a decent life for all by 2030 a unique vision of the report was the commissions environmental focus in addition to a plethora of other goals such as combating hunger and gender inequality specifically the commission argued long-term poverty reduction…requires inclusive and sustainable growth growth should create decent jobs take place with resource efficiency and within planetary boundaries and should support efforts to mitigate climate change the african unions report entitled common african position cap on the post-2015 development agenda likewise encouraged the international community to focus on eradicating the twin problems of poverty and exclusion in our lifetime moreover the cap pledged that it would commit to ensure that no person – regardless of ethnicity gender geography disability race or other status – is denied universal human rights and basic economic opportunities un ldc conferences the un least developed country ldc conferences were a series of summits organized by the un over the past few decades which sought to promote the substantial and even development of so-called third-world countries 1st un ldc conference held between september 1 and september 14 1981 in paris the first un ldc conference was organized to finalize the uns substantial new programme of action for the 1980s in least developed countries this program which was unanimously adopted by the conference attendees argued for internal reforms in ldcs meant to encourage economic growth to be complemented by strong international measures however despite the major economic and policy reforms initiated many of these ldcs in addition to strong international aid the economic situation of these countries worsened as a whole in the 1980s this prompted the organization of a 2nd un ldc conference almost a decade later 2nd un ldc conference held between september 3 and september 14 1990 once again in paris the second un ldc conference was convened to measure the progress made by the ldcs towards fulfilling their development goals during the 1980s recognizing the problems that plagued the ldcs over the past decade the conference formulated a new set of national and international policies to accelerate the growth rates of the poorest nations these new principles were embodied in the paris declaration and programme of action for the least developed countries for the 1990s 4th un ldc conference the most recent conference held in may 2011 in istanbul recognized that the nature of development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier in the 21st century the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances as opposed to bilateral and multilateral assistance moreover since the 80s significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage with the creation of the g-20 conference of the largest economic powers including many nations in the global south formerly undeveloped nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations furthermore the conference recognized that in the midst of a deep global recession coupled with multiple crises energy climate food etc the international community would have fewer resources to aid the ldcs thus the un considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders not least the ldcs themselves crucial to the formulation of the conference organizations working to end extreme poverty international organizations world bank in 2013 the board of governors of the world bank group wbg set two overriding goals for the wbg to commit itself to in the future first to end extreme poverty by 2030 an objective that echoes the sentiments of the un and the obama administration additionally the wbg set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020 second to focus on growth among the bottom 40 percent of people as opposed to standard gdp growth this commitment ensures that the growth of the developing world lifts people out of poverty rather than exacerbating inequality as the world banks primary focus is on delivering economic growth to enable equitable prosperity its developments programs are primarily commercial-based in nature as opposed to the un since the world bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus less poverty the wbg seeks to support employment training initiatives small business development programs and strong labor protection laws however since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable the world bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing field moreover the world bank engages in a variety of nutritional transfer payments and transport-based initiatives children who experience under-nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability thus they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults the wbg estimates that as much as 3 of gdp can be lost as a result of under-nutrition among the poorest nations to combat undernutrition the wbg has partnered with unicef and the who to ensure all small children are fully fed the wbg also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining childrens healthcare or ensuring school attendance finally the wbg understands investment in public transportation and better roads is key to breaking rural isolation improving access to healthcare and providing better job opportunities for the worlds poor un 1 ocha office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha of the united nations works to synchronize the disparate international national and non-governmental efforts to contest poverty the ocha seeks to prevent confusion in relief operations and to ensure that the humanitarian response to disaster situations has greater accountability and predictability to do so ocha has begun deploying humanitarian coordinators and country teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through 2 unicef united nations childrens fund the united nations childrens fund unicef was created by the un to provide food clothing and healthcare to european children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of world war ii after the un general assembly extended unicefs mandate indefinitely in 1953 it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty in more than 190 countries and territories to overcome the obstacles that poverty violence disease and discrimination place in a childs path its current focus areas are 1 child survival development 2 basic education gender equality 3 children and hivaids and 4 child protection 3

agency for international development usaid is the lead u.s government agency dedicated to ending extreme poverty currently the largest bilateral donor in the world the united states channels the majority of its development assistance through usaid and the u.s department of state in president obamas 2013 state of the union address he declared so the united states will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades...which is within our reach in response to obamas call to action usaid has made ending extreme poverty central to its mission statement under its new model of development usaid seeks to eradicate extreme poverty through the use of innovation in science and technology by putting a greater emphasis on evidence based decision-making and through leveraging the ingenuity of the private sector and global citizens a major initiative of the obama administration is power africa which aims to bring energy to 20 million people in sub-saharan africa by reaching out to its international partners whether commercial or public the us has leveraged over 14 billion in outside commitments after investing only 7 billion usd of its own to ensure that power africa reaches the regions poorest the initiative engages in a transaction based approach to create systematic change this includes expanding access to electricity to more than 20,000 additional households which already live without power in terms of specific programming usaid works in a variety of fields from preventing hunger reducing hivaids providing general health assistance and

also used to fund projects that look to understand what specifically about governance structures can be tweaked to help the worlds poorest non-governmental movements ngos a multitude of non-governmental organizations operate in the field of extreme poverty actively working to alleviate the poorest of the poor of their deprivation to name but a few notable organizations save the children the overseas development institute concern worldwide one and trickleup have all done a considerable amount of work in extreme poverty save the children is the leading international organization dedicated to helping the worlds indigent children in 2013 alone save the children reached over 143 million children through their work including over 52 million children directly save the children also recently released their own report titled getting to zero in which they argued the international community could feasibly do more than lift the worlds poor above 1.25day the overseas development institute odi is the premier uk based think tank on international development and humanitarian issues odi is dedicated to alleviating the suffering of the worlds poor by providing high-quality research and practical policy advice to the worlds development officials odi also recently released a paper entitled the chronic poverty report 2014-2015 the road to zero extreme poverty in which its authors assert that though the international communities goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is laudable much more targeted resources will be necessary to reach said target the report states that to eradicate extreme poverty massive global investment is required in social assistance education and pro-poorest economic growth concern worldwide is an international humanitarian organization whose mission is to end extreme poverty by influencing decision makers at all levels of government local  international concern has also produced a report on extreme poverty in which they explain their own conception of extreme poverty from a ngos standpoint in this paper named how concern understands extreme poverty the reports creators write that extreme poverty entails more than just living under 1.25day it also includes having a small number of assets and being vulnerable to severe negative shocks whether natural or man made one the organization confounded by bono is a non-profit organization funded almost entirely by foundations individual philanthropists and corporations ones goals include raising public awareness and working with political leaders to fight preventable diseases increase government accountability and increase investment in nutrition finally trickleup is a microenterprise development program targeted at those living under a 1.25day which provides the indigent with resources to build a sustainable livelihood through both direct financing and considerable training efforts another ngo that works to end extreme poverty is oxfam this non-governmental organization works prominently in africa and their mission is to improve local community organizations and works to reduce issues related to the development of the country oxfam helps families suffering from poverty receive food and healthcare to survive there are many children in africa experiencing growth stunting and this is one example of an issue that oxfam targets and aims to
