google book this article is about googles book search engine for googles e-book service see google play books google books previously known as google book search and google print is a service from google inc that searches the full text of books and magazines that google has scanned converted to text using optical character recognition ocr and stored in its digital database books are provided either by publishers and authors through the google books partner program or by googles library partners through the library project additionally google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives the publisher program was first known as google print when it was introduced at the frankfurt book fair in october 2004 the google books library project which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory was announced in december 2004 the google books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge but it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the ocr process as of october 2015 the number of scanned book titles was over 25 million but the scanning process has slowed down in american academic libraries google estimated in 2010 that there were about 130 million distinct titles in the world and stated that it intended to scan all of them details results from google books show up in both the universal google search as well as in the dedicated google books search website books.google.com in response to search queries google books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission if google believes the book is still under copyright a user sees snippets of text around the queried search terms all instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight the four access levels used on google books are full view books in the public domain are available for full view and can be downloaded for free in-print books acquired through the partner program are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission although this is rare preview for in-print books where permission has been granted the number of viewable pages is limited to a preview set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures some based on user-tracking usually the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview users are restricted from copying downloading or printing book previews a watermark reading copyrighted material appears at the bottom of pages all books acquired through the partner program are available for preview snippet view a snippet view – two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term – is displayed in cases where google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview this could be because google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission if a search term appears many times in a book google displays no more than three snippets thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book also google does not display any snippets for certain reference books such as dictionaries where the display of even snippets can harm the market for the work google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view no preview google also displays search results for books that have not been digitized as these books have not been scanned their text is not searchable and only the metadata information such as the title author publisher number of pages isbn subject and copyright information and in some cases a table of contents and book summary is available in effect this is similar to an online library card catalog in response to criticism from groups such as the american association of publishers and the authors guild google announced an opt-out policy in august 2005 through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that it did not want scanned and google would respect the request google also stated that it would not scan any in-copyright books between august and 1 november 2005 to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the project thus google provides a copyright owner with three choices with respect to any work it can participate in the partner program to make a book available for preview or full view in which case it would share revenue derived from the display of pages from the work in response to user queries it can let google scan the book under the library project and display snippets in response to user queries it can opt out of the library project in which case google will not scan the book if the book has already been scanned google will reset its access level as no preview each book on google books has an associated about this book page which displays analytical information regarding the book such as a word map of the most used words and phrases a selection of pages list of related books list of scholarly articles and other books that cite the book and tables of content this information is collated through automated methods and sometimes data from third-party sources is used this information provides an insight into the book particularly useful when only a snippet view is available the list of related books can often contain irrelevant entries in some cases a book summary and information about the author is also displayed the page also displays bibliographic information which can be exported as citations in bibtex endnote and refman formats registered users logged in with their google accounts can post reviews for books on this page google books also displays reviews from goodreads alongside these reviews most scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available for those which are the site provides links to the website of the publisher and booksellers linking google books can retrieve scanned books from urls based on the international standard book numbers isbn library of congress control numbers lccn and online computer library center oclc record numbers for example the about this book page of a book with the isbn 0521349931 can be linked as books.google.combooksvidisbn0521349931 for some books google also provides the ability to link directly to the front cover title page copyright page table of contents index and back cover of a book by using an appropriate parameter for example the front cover of a book with the oclc number 17546826 can be linked as books.google.combooksvidoclc17546826printsecfrontcover page numbering for many books google books displays the original page numbers resulting in many benefits such as enabling writers to prepare citations with page numbers without needing to have a print copy of the book however tim parks writing in the new york review blogs noted that google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications presumably in alliance with the publishers in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions scanning of books many of the books are scanned using a customized elphel 323 camera at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour a patent awarded to google in 2009 revealed that google had come up with an innovative system for scanning books that uses two cameras and infrared light to automatically correct for the curvature of pages in a book by constructing a 3d model of each page and then de-warping it google is able to present flat-looking pages without having to really make the pages flat which requires the use of destructive methods such as unbinding or glass plates to individually flatten each page which is inefficient for large scale scanning n-gram viewer n-gram is a service connected to google books it graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection this service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods this program has fallen under criticism because of metadata errors used in the program errors google allows users to report errors in books at the website support.google.combookspartnertroubleshooter2983879 errors in content the scanning process is subject to errors for example some pages may be unreadable upside down or in the wrong order scholars have even reported crumpled pages obscuring thumbs and fingers and smeared or blurry images on this issue a declaration from google at the end of scanned books says as of 2009 google stated that they would start using recaptcha to help fix the errors found in google book scanning’s this method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words errors in metadata scholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the metadata information on google books – including misattributed authors and erroneous dates of publication geoffrey nunberg a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before 1950 and containing the word internet turned up an unlikely 527 results woody allen is mentioned in 325 books ostensibly published before he was born google responded to nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on the outside contractors timeline 2002 a group of team members at google officially launch the “secret ‘books’ project.” google founders sergey brin and larry page came up with the idea that later became google books while still graduate students at stanford in 1996 the history page on the google books website describes their initial vision for this project “in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized people would use a ‘web crawler’ to index the books’ content and analyze the connections between them determining any given book’s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books.” this team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the library of congress’s american memory project project gutenberg and the universal library to find out how they work as well as the university of michigan page’s alma mater and the base for such digitization projects as jstor and making of america in a conversation with the at that time university president mary sue coleman when page found out that the university’s current estimate for scanning all the library’s volumes was 1,000 years page reportedly told coleman that he “believes google can help make it happen in six 2003 the team works to develop a high-speed scanning process as well as software for resolving issues in odd type sizes unusual fonts and other unexpected peculiarities december 2004 google signaled an extension to its google print initiative known as the google print library project google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries including the university of michigan harvard harvard university library stanford green library oxford bodleian library and the new york public library according to press releases and university librarians google planned to digitize and make available through its google books service approximately 15 million volumes within a decade the announcement soon triggered controversy as publisher and author associations challenged googles plans to digitize not just books in the public domain but also titles still under copyright september–october 2005 two lawsuits against google charge that the company has not respected copyrights and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers one is a class action suit on behalf of authors authors guild v google sept 20 2005 and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the association of american publishers mcgraw hill v google oct 19 2005

the us supreme court declined to hear the authors guilds appeal that means the lower courts decision stands which means google is allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law google books partner program the partner program is an online-book marketing program designed to help publishers and authors promote their books publishers and authors submit either a digital copy of their book in epub or pdf format or a print copy to google which are made available on google books for preview the publisher can control the percentage of the book available for preview with the minimum being 20 they can also choose to make the book fully viewable and even allow users to download a pdf copy books can also be made available for sale on google play google books library project the google books library project is an effort by google to scan and make searchable the collections of several major research libraries along with bibliographic information snippets of text from a book are often viewable if a book is out of copyright and in the public domain the book is fully available to read or to download in-copyright books scanned through the library project are made available on google books for snippet view regarding the quality of scans google acknowledges that they are not always of sufficiently high quality to be offered for sale on google play also because of supposed technical constraints google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers the project is the subject of the authors guild v google lawsuit filed in 2005 and ruled in favor of google in 2013 and again on appeal in 2015 copyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view by transferring it to their partner program account or request google to prevent the book text from being searched the number of institutions participating in the library project has grown since its inception the university of mysore has been mentioned in many media reports as being a library partner although it is not listed as a partner by google initial partners harvard university harvard

recently viewed browing history books for you to which books get added automatically users cannot add or remove books from these bookshelves criticism copyright infringement fair use and related issues main article authors guild v google through the project library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status which led to a number of lawsuits against google by the end of 2008 google had reportedly digitized over seven million books of which only about one million were works in the public domain of the rest one million were in copyright and in print and five million were in copyright but out of print in 2005 a group of authors and publishers brought a major class-action lawsuit against google for infringement on the copyrighted works google argued that it was preserving orphaned works – books still under copyright but whose copyright holders could not be located the authors guild and association of american publishers separately sued google in 2005 for its book project citing massive copyright infringement google countered that its project represented a fair use and is the digital age equivalent of a card catalog with every word in the publication indexed the lawsuits were consolidated and eventually a settlement was proposed the settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds including antitrust privacy and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers the settlement was eventually rejected and the publishers settled with google soon after the authors guild continued its case and in 2011 their proposed class was certified google appealed that decision with a number of amici asserting the inadequacy of the class and the second circuit rejected the class certification in july 2013 remanding the case to the district court for consideration of googles fair use defense in 2015 authors guild filed another appeal against google to be considered by the 2nd u.s circuit court of appeals in new york google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets and there are not allowing people to illegally read the book in a report courts stated that they did not infringe on copy write laws as they were protected under the fair use clause authors guild tried again in 2016 to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the supreme court the case was rejected leaving the second circuits decision on the case in tact meaning that google did not violate copy right laws this case also set a precedent for other case similar in regards to fair use laws as it further clarified the law and expands it such clarification is important in the new digital age as it effects other scanning projects similar to google other lawsuits followed the authors guilds lead in 2006 a german lawsuit previously filed was withdrawn in june 2006 hervé de la martinière a french publisher known as la martinière and Éditions du seuil announced its intention to sue google france in 2009 the paris civil court awarded 300,000 eur approximately 430,000 usd in damages and interest and ordered google to pay 10,000 eur a day until it removes the publishers books from its database the court wrote google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible books that seuil owns without its permission and that google committed acts of breach of copyright which are of harm to the publishers google said it will appeal syndicat national de ledition which joined the lawsuit said google has scanned about 100,000 french works under copyright in december 2009 chinese author mian mian filed a civil lawsuit for 8,900 against google for scanning her novel acid lovers this is the first such lawsuit to be filed against google in china also in november that year the china written works copyright society cwwcs accused google of scanning 18,000 books by 570 chinese writers without authorization google agreed on nov 20 to provide a list of chinese books it had scanned but the company refused to admit having infringed copyright laws in march 2007 thomas rubin associate general counsel for copyright trademark and trade secrets at microsoft accused google of violating copyright law with their book search service rubin specifically criticized googles policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of digital watermarking techniques with the books some published works that are in the public domain such as all works created by the u.s federal government are still treated like other works under copyright and therefore locked after 1922 academic criticism for many scholars a far more egregious problem with the project stems from the fact that it does not seem to be meeting its fundamental state goal of preserving orphaned and out-of-print works google has apparently been passing huge numbers of scanned and electronic-text books into circulation without editing the texts for errors introduced by the digitizing processes this problem has been apparent for a number of years but became obvious in a big way in 2014 when google formed a partnership with bookseller barnes noble through which google made more than a half a million public domain texts available to barnes noble to be offered for free on the nook shop for their e-readers customers downloading these books discovered that as many as 80 of them were essentially unreadable riddled with a large number of errors introduced by either the scanning process itself or the conversion of the scans into electronic texts via optical character recognition ocr software google apparently scanned the texts but did not trouble to edit them for errors and barnes noble compounded the problem by not exercising any quality control over the google texts simply offering them unexamined in their shop to customers the effect of the scan and ocr errors is to render the contents of many books essentially unreadable a problem especially in scientific works where incorrectly rendered missing or extraneous characters in scientific equations may render them meaningless also of concern are the large numbers of metadata errors in the google collection metadata refers to the information which identifies a particular text title author publisher publication place and date subject classification etc – essentially the information which would be found in a library card catalog one investigator found thousands of such errors in the samples he took including publication dates that predated the birth of the books author e.g 182 works by charles dickens supposedly published prior to his birth in 1812 wildly inappropriate subject classifications an edition of moby dick found under computers a biography of mae west classified under religion conflicting classifications 10 editions of whitmans leaves of grass all classified as both fiction and nonfiction incorrectly spelled titles authors and publishers moby dick  or the white wall metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book the metadata for an 1818 mathematical work leads to a 1963 romance novel books about the internet with publication dated before the internet existed and many more such metadata errors can make doing serious research using the google books project database difficult if not impossible – even assuming all of the scanned texts were edited and error corrected to date google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors language issues some european politicians and intellectuals have criticized googles effort on linguistic imperialism grounds they argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in english it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world german russian french and spanish for instance are popular languages in scholarship the disproportionate online emphasis on english however could shape access to historical scholarship and ultimately the growth and direction of future scholarship among these critics is jean-noël jeanneney the former president of the bibliothèque nationale de france google books versus google scholar while google books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues this has led the makers of google scholar to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles in agreement with their publishers similar projects project gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works to encourage the creation and distribution of ebooks it was founded in 1971 by michael s hart and is the oldest digital library as of 3 october 2015 project gutenberg reached 50,000 items in its collection internet archive is a non-profit which digitizes over 1000 books a day as well as mirrors books from google books and other sources as of may 2011 it hosted over 2.8 million public domain books greater than the approximate 1 million public domain books at google books open library a sister project of internet archive lends 80,000 scanned and purchased commercial ebooks to the visitors of 150 libraries hathitrust maintains hathitrust digital library since 13 october 2008 which preserves and provides access to material scanned by google some of the internet archive books and some scanned locally by partner institutions as of may 2010 it includes about 6 million volumes over 1 million of which are public domain at least in the us microsoft funded the scanning of 300,000 books to create live search books in late 2006 it ran until may 2008 when the project was abandoned and the books were made freely available on the internet archive europeana links to roughly 10 million digital objects as of 2010 including video photos paintings audio maps manuscripts printed books and newspapers from the past 2,000 years of european history from over 1,000 archives in the european union gallica from the
