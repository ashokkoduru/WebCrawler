for other uses see welfare disambiguation well-being wellbeing welfare or wellness is a general term for the condition of an individual or group for example their social economic psychological spiritual or medical state a high level of well-being means in some sense the individual or groups condition is positive while low well-being is associated with negative happenings in philosophy the term well-being and welfare utility etc refers to the manner in which an individuals life manifests desires objectives and needs  among myriad more diverse variables  and how these affect the individuals perspective philosophers such as fred feldman and brad hooker have suggested we should think of well-being in terms of a parents expectations for a child aka crib test philosophical study of well-being identifies a number of different kinds of theory such as hedonism desire-fulfilment theory objective-list theory perfectionism and some mixed or hybrid views of well-being well-being features in normative ethical theories most notably utilitarianism one need not be a utilitarian or a consequentialist more generally to think that well-being is a moral matter any plausible ethical theory will give at least some role to well-being in economics the term is used for one or more quantitative measures intended to assess the quality of life of a group for example in the capabilities approach and the economics of happiness as with the related cognate terms wealth and welfare economics sources often contrast the state with its opposite the study of well-being is divided into subjective well-being and objective well-being background although there has not been a clear definition established for well-being it can be defined as “...a special case of attitude” this definition serves two purposes of well-being developing and testing a systematic theory for the structure of interrelationships among varieties of well-being and integration of well-being theory with the ongoing cumulative theory development in the fields of attitude of related research” one’s well-being develops through assessments of their environment and emotions and then developing an interpretation of their own personal self there are two different types of well-being cognitive and affective social well-being is mentioned in canadian law a more current definition of wellness and its distinction from health is the following wellness refers to diverse and interconnected dimensions of physical mental and social well-being that extend beyond the traditional definition of health it includes choices and activities aimed at achieving physical vitality mental alacrity social satisfaction a sense of accomplishment and personal fulfillment in other words although health is part of wellbeing some people are able to maintain satisfactory wellbeing despite the presence of psychological symptoms cognitive cognitive well-being is developed through assessing one’s interactions with their environment and other people “welfare economics ultimately deals with cognitive concepts such as well-being happiness and satisfaction these relate to notions such as aspirations and needs contentment and disappointment” people tend to assess their cognitive well-being based on the social classes that are in their community in communities with a wide variety of social statuses the lower class will tend to compare their lifestyle to those of higher class and assess what they do and do not have that could lead to a higher level of well-being whenever someone interprets their needs and wants as to being satisfied or not they then develop their cognitive well-being affective these are the different levels of affect on well-being “...high negative affect is represented by anxiety and hostility low negative affect is represented by calmness and relaxation high positive affect is represented by a state of pleasant arousal enthusiasm and low positive affect is represented by a state of unpleasantness and low arousal dull sluggish” well-being is most usefully thought of as the dynamic process that gives people a sense of how their lives are going through the interaction between their circumstances activities and psychological resources or sense of their own ‘mental capital’ or as has been recorded elsewhere it could be said that well-being is a state of complete wellness psychology according to mcnulty 2012,“...positive psychology at the subjective level is about valued subjective experiences” well-being is an important factor in this subjective experience as well as contentment satisfaction with the past optimism for the future and happiness in the present people are more likely to experience positive psychology if they take in the good things in each experience or situation even with regard to the past if a person only focuses on the negative the brain will only be able to recognise the negative the more the brain has access to the negative the easier it becomes because that is what is more memorable it takes more effort for the brain to remember the positive experiences because typically it is the smaller actions and experiences that are the positive ones james mcnultys 2012 research examines this idea further he argues that “...well-being is not determined solely by people’s psychological characteristics but instead is determined jointly by the interplay between those characteristics and qualities of peoples social environments” when people experience well-being they are experiencing a sense of emotional freedom – there is nothing negative that is holding them back from experiencing positive emotions this is true if a person is in a certain setting because it has been demonstrated in previous research that particular environments can hold a lot of memories for an individual just because of what was shared there and the meaning of it source therefore “...well-being is often equated with the experience of pleasure and the absence of pain over time” the less psychological pain an individual is experiencing the more he or she is going to experience well-being when someone is experiencing well-being they are also experiencing several other things it involves a sense of self-fulfillment which is the feeling of being happy and satisfied because one is doing something that fully uses ones abilities and talents merriam-webster the feeling of having a purpose in life and connection with others are also contributors to the idea of well-being when people feel as though they have a purpose in the world they feel like they belong they feel like they matter the tripartite model of mental well-being is one of the most comprehensive models of well-being in psychology this model views mental well-being as having three components of hedonic or subjective psychological and social well-being hedonic well-being concerns emotional aspects of well-being whereas psychological and social well-being concerns skills abilities and optimal functioning the tripartite model of mental well-being has received extensive empirical support across cultures education when talking about the school system the idea of well-being is not as well defined it is argued that school should only be about learning and education but children also learn about social skills and themselves when a child feels like they belong they are more likely to perform better in school as well as accessing an education ideally they need to learn how to believe in themselves and create purpose for themselves if well-being is established in kids at a young age then it is more likely to play a part in their life as they get older john white 2013 looked at public schools in britain now and in the past in the past schools only focused on knowledge and education but now britain has moved to a broader direction their every child matters initiative seeks to enhance childrens well-being across the range of childrens services financial “wellbeing” has traditionally focused on improving physical emotional and mental quality of life with little understanding of how dependent they all are on financial health however financial stress often manifests itself in physical and emotional difficulties that lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity a more inclusive paradigm for wellbeing would acknowledge money as a source of empowerment that maximizes physical and emotional health by reducing financial stress such a model would provide individuals with the financial knowledge they need as well enable them to gain valuable insight and understanding regarding their financial habits as well as their thoughts feelings fears and attitudes about money through this work individuals would be better equipped to manage their money and achieve the financial wellness that is essential for their overall wellbeing subjective subjective well-being is “...based on the idea that how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important” this idea is developed specifically in a person’s culture people base their own well-being in relation to their environment and the lives of others around them well-being is also subject to how one feels other people in their environment perceive them whether that positively or negatively well-being is also subject to pleasure and whether or not basic human needs are fulfilled although it could be said one’s needs and wants are never fully satisfied the quality of life of an individual and a society is dependent on the amount of happiness and pleasure the experience as well as their relationship to human health whether or not other cultures are subject to internal culture appraisal is based on that cultures type “collectivistic cultures are more likely to use norms and the social appraisals of others in evaluating their subjective well-being whereas those individualistic societies are more likely to heavily weight the internal frame of reference arising from one’s own happiness” ethnic identity ethnic identity may play a role in an individuals cognitive well-being studies have shown that “...both social psychological and developmental perspectives suggest that a strong secure ethnic identity makes a positive contribution to cognitive well-being” those in an acculturated society may feel more equal as a human being within their culture therefore experiencing increased well-being individual roles individual roles play a part in cognitive well-being not only does having social ties improve cognitive well-being it also improves psychological health having multiple identities and roles helps individuals to relate to their society and provide the opportunity for each to contribute more as they increase their roles therefore creating enhanced levels of cognitive well-being each individual role is ranked internally within a hierarchy of salience salience is “...the subjective importance that a person attaches to each identity” different roles an individual has have a different impact on their well-being within this hierarchy higher roles offer more of a source to their well-being and define more meaningfulness to their overall role as a human being sports according to bloodworth and mcnamee sports and physical activities are a key contributor to the development of peoples well-being the influence of sports on well-being is conceptualized within a framework which includes impermanence its hedonistic shallowness and its epistemological inadequacy researching the effect of sport on well-being is difficult as some societies are unable to access sports a deficiency in studying this phenomenon see also wellness notes additional reading routledge handbook of the philosophy of
