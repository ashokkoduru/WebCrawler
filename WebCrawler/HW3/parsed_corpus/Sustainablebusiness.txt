that has minimal negative impact on the global or local environment community society or economy—a business that strives to meet the triple bottom line often sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and human rights policies in general business is described as green if it matches the following four criteria it incorporates principles of sustainability into each of its business decisions it supplies environmentally friendly products or services that replaces demand for nongreen products andor services it is greener than traditional competition it has made an enduring commitment to environmental principles in its business operations a sustainable business is any organization that participates in environmentally friendly or green activities to ensure that all processes products and manufacturing activities adequately address current environmental concerns while maintaining a profit in other words it is a business that “meets the needs of the present world without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs.” it is the process of assessing how to design products that will take advantage of the current environmental situation and how well a company’s products perform with renewable resources the brundtland report emphasized that sustainability is a three-legged stool of people planet and profit sustainable businesses with the supply chain try to balance all three through the triple-bottom-line concept—using sustainable development and sustainable distribution to affect the environment business growth and the society everyone affects the sustainability of the marketplace and the planet in some way sustainable development within a business can create value for customers investors and the environment a sustainable business must meet customer needs while at the same time treating the environment well in order to be successful in such an approach where stakeholder balancing and joint solutions is key a structural approach is needed one philosophy that include many different tools and methods is the concept of sustainable enterprise excellence sustainability is often confused with corporate social responsibility csr though the two are not the same bansal and desjardine 2014 state that the notion of ‘time’ discriminates sustainability from csr and other similar concepts whereas ethics morality and norms permeate csr sustainability only obliges businesses to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity short-termism is the bane of sustainability green business has been seen as a possible mediator of economic-environmental relations and if proliferated would serve to diversify our economy even if it has a negligible effect at lowering atmospheric co2 levels the definition of green jobs is ambiguous but it is generally agreed that these jobs the result of green business should be linked to clean energy and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases these corporations can be seen as generators of not only green energy but as producers of new materialities that are the product of the technologies these firms developed and deployed environmental sphere a major initiative of sustainable businesses is to eliminate or decrease the environmental harm caused by the production and consumption of their goods the impact of such human activities in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases produced can be measured in units of carbon dioxide and is referred to as the carbon footprint the carbon footprint concept is derived from ecological footprint analysis which examines the ecological capacity required to support the consumption of products businesses take a wide range of green initiatives one of the most common examples is the act of going paperless or sending electronic correspondence in lieu of paper when possible on a higher level examples of sustainable business practices include refurbishing used products e.g tuning up lightly used commercial fitness equipment for resale revising production processes in order to eliminate waste such as using a more accurate template to cut out designs and choosing nontoxic raw materials and processes for example canadian farmers have found that hemp is a sustainable alternative to rapeseed in their traditional crop rotation hemp grown for fiber or seed requires no pesticides or herbicides sustainable business leaders also take into account the life cycle costs for the items they produce input costs must be considered in regards to regulations energy use storage and disposal designing for the environment dfe is also an element of sustainable business this process enables users to consider the potential environmental impacts of a product and the process used to make that product the many possibilities for adopting green practices have led to considerable pressure being put upon companies from consumers employees government regulators and other stakeholders some companies have resorted to greenwashing instead of making meaningful changes merely marketing their products in ways that suggest green practices for example various producers in the bamboo fiber industry have been taken to court for advertising their products as more green than they are still countless other companies have taken the sustainability trend seriously and are enjoying profits in their book “corporate sustainability in international comparison” schaltegger et al 2014 analyse the current state of corporate sustainability management and corporate social responsibility across eleven countries their research is based on an extensive survey focusing on the companies’ intention to pursue sustainability management i.e motivation issues the integration of sustainability in the organisation i.e connecting sustainability to the core business involving corporate functions using drivers of business cases for sustainability and the actual implementation of sustainability management measures i.e stakeholder management sustainability management tools and standards measurements the gort cloud written by richard seireeni 2009 documents the experiences of sustainable businesses in america and their reliance on the vast but invisible green community referred to as the gort cloud for support and a market green investment firms are consequently attracting unprecedented interest in the uk for instance the green investment bank is devoted exclusively to supporting renewable domestic energy however the uk and europe as a whole are falling behind the impressive pace set by developing nations in terms of green development thus green investment firms are creating more and more opportunities to support sustainable development practices in emerging economies by providing micro-loans and larger investments these firms assist small business owners in developing nations who seek business education affordable loans and new distribution networks for their green products sustainable businesses among large corporations ford motor company occupies an odd role in the story of sustainability ironically founder henry ford was a pioneer in the sustainable business realm experimenting with plant-based fuels during the days of the model t ford motor company also shipped the model a truck in crates that then became the vehicle floorboards at the factory destination this was a form of upcycling retaining high quality in a closed-loop industrial cycle furthermore the original auto body was made of a stronger-than-steel hemp composite today of course fords arent made of hemp nor do they run on the most sensible fuel currently fords claim to eco-friendly fame is the use of seat fabric made from 100 post-industrial materials and renewable soy foam seat bases ford executives recently appointed the company’s first senior vice president of sustainability environment and safety engineering this position is responsible for establishing a long-range sustainability strategy and environmental policy the person in this position will also help develop the products and processes necessary to satisfy both customers and society as a whole while working toward energy independence it remains to be seen whether ford will return to its founders vision of a petroleum-free automobile a vehicle powered by the remains of plant matter the automobile manufacturer subaru is a sustainability giant in 2008 a subaru assembly plant in lafayette became the first auto manufacturer to achieve zero land fill status when the plant implemented sustainable policies the company successfully managed to implement a plan that increased refuse recycling to 99.8 in 2012 the corporation increased the reuse of styrofoam by 9 and from the year 2008 to the year 2012 environmental incidents and accidents reduced from 18 to 4 smaller companies such as natures path an organic cereal and snack making business have also made significant sustainability gains in the 21st century ceo arran stephens and his associates have ensured that the quickly growing companys products are produced without toxic farm chemicals furthermore employees are constantly encouraged to find ways to reduce consumption sustainability is an essential part of corporate discussions another example comes from salt spring coffee a company created in 1996 as a certified organic fair trade coffee producer in recent years they have become carbon neutral lowering emissions by reducing long-range trucking and using bio-diesel in delivery trucks upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing carbon offsets the company claims to offer the first carbon neutral coffee sold in canada salt spring coffee was recognized by the david suzuki foundation in the 2010 report doing business in a new climate a third example comes from korea where rice husks are used as a nontoxic packaging for stereo components and other electronics the same material is later recycled to make bricks the mining and specifically gold mining industries are also moving to be more sustainable especially given that the industry is one of the most destructive in environmental terms in the world indeed regarding gold mining northwestern university scientists have in the laboratory discovered an inexpensive and environmentally sustainable method that uses simple cornstarch  instead of cyanide  to isolate gold from raw materials in a selective manner such a method will reduce the amount of cyanide released into the environment during gold extraction from raw ore with one of the northwestern university scientists sir fraser stoddart stating that “the elimination of cyanide from the gold industry is of the utmost importance environmentally additionally the retail jewelry industry is now making attempts to be totally sustainable with companies using green energy providers and recycling more as well as preventing the use of mined-so called virgin gold from being used by applying re-finishing methods on pieces and re-selling them furthermore the customer may opt for fairtrade gold which gives a better deal to small scale and artisanal miners and is an element of sustainable business however not all think that mining can be sustainable and much more needs to be done noting that mining in general is in need of greater regional and international legislation and regulation which is a valid point given the huge impact mining has on the planet and the huge number of products and goods that are made wholly or partly from mined materials social sphere organizations that give back to the community whether through employees volunteering their time or through charitable donations are often considered to be socially sustainable organizations also can encourage education in their communities by training their employees and offering internships to younger members of the community practices such as these increase the education level and quality of life in the community in order for a business to be truly sustainable it must sustain not only the necessary environmental resources but also its social resources including employees customers the community and its reputation organizations the european community’s restriction of hazardous substances directive restricts the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of various electronic and electrical products waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directives provide collection recycling and recovery practices for electrical goods the world business council for sustainable development and the world resources institute are two organizations working together to set a standard for reporting on corporate carbon footprints from october 2013 all quoted companies in the uk are legally required to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions in their directors’ report under the companies act 2006 strategic and directors’ reports regulations 2013 lester brown’s plan b 2.0 and hunter lovins’s natural capitalism provide information on sustainability initiatives corporate sustainability strategies corporate sustainability strategies can aim to take advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities while protecting the value of business against increasing energy costs the costs of meeting regulatory requirements changes in the way customers perceive brands and products and the volatile price of resources not all eco-strategies can be incorporated into a companys eco-portfolio immediately the widely practiced strategies include innovation collaboration process improvement and sustainability reporting 1 innovation technology this introverted method of sustainable corporate practices focuses on a companys ability to change its products and services towards less waste production and sustainable best practices 2 collaboration the formation of networks with similar or partner companies facilitates knowledge sharing and propels innovation 3 process improvement continuous process surveying and improvement is essential to reduction in waste employee awareness of company-wide sustainability plan further aids the integration of new and improved processes 4 sustainability reporting periodic reporting of company performance in relation to goals these goals are often incorporated in to the corporate mission as in the case of ford motor co 5 greening the supply chain sustainable procurement is important for any sustainability strategy as a companys impact on the environment is much bigger than the products that they consume the b corporation certification model is a good example of one that encourages companies to focus on this additionally companies might consider implementing a sound measurement and management system with readjustment procedures as well as a regular forum for all stakeholders to discuss sustainablity issues the sustainability balanced scorecard is a performance measurement and management system aiming at balancing financial and non-financial as well as short and long-term measures it explicitly integrates strategically relevant environmental social and ethical goals into the overall performance management system and supports strategic sustainability management standards enormous economic and population growth worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century aggravated the factors that threaten health and the world — ozone depletion climate change depletion fouling of natural resources and extensive loss of biodiversity and habitat in the past the standard approaches to environmental problems generated by business and industry have been regulatory-driven end-of-the-pipe remediation efforts in the 1990s efforts by governments ngos corporations and investors began to grow substantially to develop awareness and plans for investment in business sustainability one critical milestone was the establishment of the iso 14000 standards whose development came as a result of the rio summit on the environment held in 1992 iso 14001 is the cornerstone standard of the iso 14000 series it specifies a framework of control for an environmental management system against which an organization can be certified by a third party other iso 14000 series standards are actually guidelines many to help you achieve registration to iso 14001 they include the following iso 14004 provides guidance on the development and implementation of environmental management systems iso 14010 provides general principles of environmental auditing now superseded by iso 19011 iso 14011 provides specific guidance on audit an environmental management system now superseded by iso 19011 iso 14012 provides guidance on qualification criteria for environmental auditors and lead auditors now superseded by iso 19011 iso 140135 provides audit program review and assessment material iso 14020 labeling issues iso 14030 provides guidance on performance targets and monitoring within an environmental management system iso 14040 covers life cycle issues leed certification the leadership in energy and environmental design standards were developed by the us green building council in an effort to propel green building design in the united states leed certification is very prestigious title and can be attained through compliance with all environmental laws and regulations occupancy scenarios building permanence and pre-rating completion site boundaries and area-to-site ratios and obligatory five-year sharing of whole building energy and water use data from the start of occupancy for new construction or date of certification for existing buildings.15 six essential characteristics matthew tueth ph.d reiterates the ideas put forward by authors such as paul hawken the ecology of commerce and natural capitalism bill mcdonough and michael braungart cradle to cradle and janine benyus biomimicry when he proposes that a mature and authentic sustainable business contains six essential characteristics 1 triple top-line value production the ttl establishes three simultaneous requirements of sustainable business activities  financial benefits for the company natural world betterment and social advantages for employees and members of the local community—with each of these three components recognized as equal in status whereas many businesses use the triple bottom line triple top line stresses the importance of initial design and is a term attributable to mcdonough and braungart in their book cradle to cradle 2 nature-based knowledge and technology this biomimicry-based principal sic involves the conscious emulation of natural-world genius in terms of growing our food harnessing our energy constructing things conducting business healing ourselves processing information and designing our communities 3 products of service to products of consumption see also cradle to cradle design § definitions products of service are durable goods routinely leased by the customer that are made of technical materials and are returned to the manufacturer and re-processed into a new generation of products when they are worn out.these products are mostly non-toxic to human and environmental health but toxic materials that are used will be kept within a closed loop type system and not be able to escape into the environment products of consumption are shorter lived items made only of biodegradable materials they are broken down by the detritus organisms after the products lose their usefulness.these are also non-hazardous to human or environmental health this principal requires that we manufacture only these two types of products and necessitates the gradual but continual reductions of products of service and their replacement with products of consumption as technological advancements allow 4 solar wind geothermal and ocean energy this principalsic advocates employing only sustainable energy technology—solar wind ocean and geothermal—that can meet our energy needs indefinitely without negative effects for life on earth other authors such as paul hawken have referred to this as utilizing current solar income 5 local-based organizations and economies this ingredient includes durable beautiful and healthy communities with locally owned and operated businesses and locally managed non-profit organizations along with regional corporations and shareholders working together in a dense web of partnerships and collaborations 6 continuous improvement process operational processes inside successful organizations include provisions for constant advancements and upgrade as the company does its business the continuous process of monitoring analyzing redesigning and implementing is used to intensify ttl value production as conditions change and new opportunities emerge challenges and opportunities implementing sustainable business practices may have an effect on profits and a firms financial bottom line at first blush this challenge might make many corporate executives cringe however during a time where environmental awareness is popular green strategies are likely to be embraced by employees consumers and other stakeholders in fact according to many studies a positive correlation exists between environmental performance and economic performance if an organisation’s current business model is inherently unsustainable becoming a truly sustainable business requires a complete makeover of the business model e.g from selling cars to offering car sharing and other mobility services this can present a major challenge due to the differences between the old and the new model and the respective skills resources and infrastructure needed a new business model can also offer major opportunities by entering or even creating new markets and reaching new customer groups companies leading the way in sustainable business practices can be said to be taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities according to the department for business innovation and skills the uk green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015 and the average internal rate of return on energy efficiency investments for large businesses is 48 a 2013 survey suggests that demand for green products appears to be increasing 27 of respondents said they are more likely to buy a sustainable product andor service than 5 years ago furthermore sustainable business practices may attract talent and generate tax breaks see also b4e business for the environment green america
