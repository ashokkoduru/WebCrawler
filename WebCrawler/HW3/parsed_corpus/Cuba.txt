but it may be translated either as where fertile land is abundant cubao or great place coabana authors who believe that christopher columbus was portuguese state that cuba was named by columbus for the town of cuba in the district of beja in portugal history main articles history of cuba and timeline of cuban history prehistory before the arrival of the spanish cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of american indian people the taíno an arawak people the guanajatabey and the ciboney people the ancestors of the ciboney migrated from the mainland of south america with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 bp the taíno arrived from hispanola sometime in the 3rd century a.d when columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in cuba having an estimated population of 150,000 the name

columbus claimed the island for the new kingdom of spain and named it isla juana after juan prince of asturias in 1511 the first spanish settlement was founded by diego velázquez de cuéllar at baracoa other towns soon followed including san cristobal de la habana founded in 1515 which later became the capital the native taíno were forced to work under the encomienda system which resembled a feudal system in medieval europe within a century the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to multiple factors primarily eurasian infectious diseases to which they had no natural resistance immunity aggravated by harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation in 1529 a measles outbreak in cuba killed two-thirds of those few natives who had previously survived smallpox on may 18 1539 conquistador hernando de soto departed from havana cuba at the head of some 600 followers into a vast expedition through the southeastern united states starting at la florida in search of gold treasure fame and power on september 1 1548 dr gonzalo perez de angulo was appointed governor of cuba he arrived in santiago cuba on november 4 1549 and immediately declared the liberty of all natives he became cubas first permanent governor to reside in havana instead of santiago and he built havanas first church made of masonry after the french took havana in 1555 the governors son francisco de angulo went to mexico cuba developed slowly and unlike the plantation islands of the caribbean had a diversified agriculture but what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the spanish colonial empire by the mid-18th century its colonists held 50,000 slaves compared to 60,000 in barbados 300,000 in virginia both british colonies and 450,000 in french saint-domingue which had large-scale sugar cane plantations the seven years war which erupted in 1754 across three continents eventually arrived in the spanish caribbean spains alliance with the french pitched them into direct conflict with the british and in 1762 a british expedition of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from portsmouth to capture cuba the british arrived on june 6 and by august had havana under siege when havana surrendered the admiral of the british fleet george keppel the 3rd earl of albemarle entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island the british immediately opened up trade with their north american and caribbean colonies causing a rapid transformation of cuban society they imported food horses and other goods into the city as well as thousands of slaves from west africa to work on the under developed sugar plantations though havana which had become the third-largest city in the americas was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with north america during this period the british occupation of the city proved short-lived pressure from london sugar merchants fearing a decline in sugar prices forced negotiations with the spanish over colonial territories less than a year after britain seized havana it signed the peace of paris together with france and spain ending the seven years war the treaty gave britain florida in exchange for cuba the french had recommended this to spain advising that declining to give up florida could result in spain instead losing mexico and much of the south american mainland to the british many in britain were disappointed believing that florida was a poor return for cuba and britains other gains in the war the real engine for the growth of cubas commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the haitian revolution when the enslaved peoples of what had been the caribbeans richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt cuban planters perceived the regions changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity they were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in cuba too and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in cuba that had previously been slaves in french colonies underscored this anxiety the planters saw opportunity however because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing pearl of the antilles that haiti had been before the revolution as the historian ada ferrer has written at a basic level liberation in saint-domingue helped entrench its denial in cuba as slavery and colonialism collapsed in the french colony the spanish island underwent transformations that were almost the mirror image of haitis estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820 some 325,000 africans were imported to cuba as slaves which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790 although a smaller proportion of the population of cuba was enslaved at times slaves arose in revolt in 1812 the aponte slave rebellion took place but it was suppressed the population of cuba in 1817 was 630,980 of which 291,021 were white 115,691 free people of color mixed-race and 224,268 black slaves this was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in virginia for instance or the other caribbean islands historians such as swedish magnus mõrner who studied slavery in latin america found that manumissions increased when slave economies were in decline as in 18th-century cuba and early 19th-century maryland of the united states in part due to cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings by the 19th century there had developed the practice of coartacion or buying oneself out of slavery a uniquely cuban development according to historian herbert s klein due to a shortage of white labor blacks dominated urban industries to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century they were unable to displace negro workers a system of diversified agriculture with small farms and fewer slaves served to supply the cities with produce and other goods in the 1820s when the rest of spains empire in latin america rebelled and formed independent states cuba remained loyal its economy was based on serving the empire by 1860 cuba had 213,167 free people of color 39 of its non-white population of 550,000 by contrast virginia with about the same number of blacks had only 58,042 or 11 who were free the rest were enslaved in the antebellum years virginia discouraged manumissions after the nat turners slave rebellion of 1831 and strengthened restrictions against free blacks as did other southern states in addition there was a high demand for slaves and virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade to be shipped or taken overland to the deep south which had greatly expanded its cotton production independence movements see also cuban war of independence full independence from spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter carlos manuel de céspedes de céspedes a sugar planter freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent cuba on december 27 1868 he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service the 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the ten years war two thousand cuban chinese joined the rebels chinese had been imported as indentured laborers a monument in havana honours the cuban chinese who fell in the war the united states declined to recognize the new cuban government although many european and latin american nations did so in 1878 the pact of zanjón ended the conflict with spain promising greater autonomy to cuba in 1879–1880 cuban patriot calixto

relied mostly on guerrilla and sabotage tactics the spaniards began a campaign of suppression general valeriano weyler military governor of cuba herded the rural population into what he called

first president tomás estrada palma faced an armed revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government forces the u.s intervened by occupying cuba and named charles edward magoon as governor for three years cuban historians have characterized magoons governorship as having introduced political and social corruption in 1908 self-government was restored when josé miguel gómez was elected president but the u.s continued intervening in cuban affairs in 1912 the partido independiente de color attempted to establish a separate black republic in oriente province but was suppressed by general monteagudo with considerable bloodshed in 1924 gerardo machado was elected president during his administration tourism increased markedly and american-owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists the tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution the wall street crash of 1929 led to a collapse in the price of sugar political unrest and repression protesting students known as the generation of 1930 turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular machado a general strike in which the communist party sided with machado

fulgencio batista overthrew cespedes a five-member executive committee the pentarchy of 1933 was chosen to head a provisional government ramon grau san martin was then appointed as provisional president grau resigned in 1934 leaving the way clear for batista who dominated cuban politics for the next 25 years at first through a series of puppet-presidents the period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of virtually unremitting social and political warfare a new constitution was adopted in 1940 which engineered radical progressive ideas including the right to labour and health care batista was elected president in the same year holding the post until 1944 he is so far the only non-white cuban to win the nations highest political office his government carried out major social reforms several members of the communist party held office under his administration cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during world war ii although president batista suggested a joint u.s.-latin american assault on francoist spain in order to overthrow its authoritarian regime batista adhered to the 1940 constitutions strictures preventing his re-election ramon grau san martin was the winner of the next election in 1944 grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the cuban political system in particular by undermining the deeply flawed though not entirely ineffectual congress and supreme court carlos prío socarrás a protégé of grau became president in 1948 the two terms of the auténtico party saw an influx of investment which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas after running unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952 batista staged a coup he outlawed the cuban communist party in 1952 after the coup cuba had latin americas highest per capita consumption rates of meat vegetables cereals automobiles telephones and radios though about one third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption in 1958 cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by latin american standards and in some cases by world standards on the other hand cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in latin america including bans on dismissals and mechanization they were obtained in large measure at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants leading to disparities between 1933 and 1958 cuba extended economic regulations enormously causing economic problems unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs the middle class which was comparable to that of the united states became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution the labor unions supported

the vast majority of those executed following the 1959 revolution were policemen politicians and informers of the batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the cuban population the united states government initially reacted favorably to the cuban revolution seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to latin america castros legalization of the communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries the promulgation of the agrarian reform law expropriating thousands of acres of farmland including from large u.s landholders further worsened relations in response between 1960 and 1964 the u.s imposed a range of sanctions eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all cuban-owned assets in the u.s in february 1960 castro signed a commercial agreement with soviet

segregated from cuban society referred to as enclave tourism and tourism apartheid contacts between foreign visitors and ordinary cubans were de facto illegal between 1992 and 1997 the rapid growth of tourism during the special period had widespread social and economic repercussions in cuba and led to speculation about the emergence of a two-tier economy cuba has tripled its market share of caribbean tourism in the last decade as a result of significant investment in tourism infrastructure this growth rate is predicted to continue 1.9 million tourists visited cuba in 2003 predominantly from canada and the european union generating revenue of us2.1 billion cuba recorded 2,688,000 international tourists in 2011 the third-highest figure in the caribbean behind the dominican republic

miles across the straits of florida to the north and northwest to the closest tip of key west florida and the bahamas 21 km 13 mi to the north mexico lies 210 kilometers 130 miles across the yucatán channel to the west to the closest tip of cabo catoche in the state of quintana roo haiti is 77 km 48 mi to the east jamaica 140 km87 mi and the cayman islands to the south cuba is the principal island surrounded by four smaller groups of islands the colorados archipelago on the northwestern coast the sabana-camagüey archipelago on the north-central atlantic coast the jardines de la reina on the south-central coast and the canarreos archipelago on the southwestern coast the main island named cuba is 1,250 km 780 mi long constituting most of the nations land area 104,556 km 40,369 sq mi and is the largest island in the caribbean and 17th-largest island in the world by land area the main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the sierra maestra mountains in the southeast whose highest point is pico turquino 1,974 m 6,476 ft the second-largest island is isla de la juventud isle of youth in the canarreos archipelago with an area of 2,200 km 849 sq mi cuba has an official area land area of 109,884 km 42,426 sq mi its area is 110,860 km 42,803 sq mi including coastal and territorial waters climate main article climate of cuba with most of the island south of the tropic of cancer the local climate is tropical moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round the temperature is also shaped by the caribbean current which brings in warm water from the equator this makes the climate of cuba warmer than that of hong kong which is at around the same latitude as cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate in general with local variations there is a drier season from november to april and a rainier season from may to october the average temperature is 21 °c 69.8 °f in january and 27 °c 80.6 °f in july the warm temperatures of the caribbean sea and the fact that cuba sits across the entrance to the gulf of mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes these are most common in september and october biodiversity cuba signed the rio convention on biological diversity on june 12 1992 and became a party to the convention on march 8 1994 it has subsequently produced a national biodiversity strategy and action plan with one revision which was received by the convention on january 24 2008 the revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery there is however virtually no information in that document about biodiversity itself the countrys fourth national report to the cbd however contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from cuba the main groups being animals 17,801 species bacteria 270 species chromista 707 species fungi including lichen-forming species 5844 species plants 9107 species and protozoa 1440 species as elsewhere in the world vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented the numbers recorded from cuba for those groups are therefore likely to be close to the numbers which actually occur in cuba for most if not all of the other groups however the true numbers of species occurring in cuba are likely to exceed often considerably the numbers of those recorded so far demographics main articles cuban people and demographics of cuba according to the official census of 2010 cubas population was 11,241,161 comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women its birth rate 9.88 births per thousand population in 2006 is one of the lowest in the western hemisphere although the country has grown by around 4 million people since 1961 the rate of increase had simultaneously began to fall during that period and the population began to decline in 2006 with a fertility rate of 1.43 children per woman indeed this drop in fertility is among the largest in the western hemisphere and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion cubas abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996 compared to an average of 35 in the caribbean 27 in latin america overall and 48 in europe similarly the use of contraceptives is also widespread estimated at 79 of the female population in the upper third of countries in the western hemisphere ethnoracial groups cubas population is multiethnic reflecting its complex colonial origins intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the countrys racial composition whereas the institute for cuban and cuban-american studies at the university of miami determined that 62 of cubans are black the 2002 cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population 65.05 was white in fact the minority rights group international determined that an objective assessment of the situation of afro-cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre and post-revolution estimates of the percentage of people of african descent in the cuban population vary enormously ranging from 34 to 62 an study from 2014 found the autosomal genetic ancestry in cuba to be 72 european 20 african and 8 native american 35 of maternal lineages derived from cuban native americans compared to 39 from africa and 26 from europe but male lineages were exclusively european 82 and african 18 indicating the historical bias towards mating between foreign men and native women rather than the inverse ancestral contributions in cubans as inferred from autosomal aims ancestral contributions in cubans as inferred from y-chromosome markers ancestral contributions in cubans as inferred from mtdna markers asians make up about 1 of the population and are largely of chinese ancestry followed by filipinos japanese and vietnamese many are descendants of farm laborers brought to the island by spanish and american contractors during the 19th and early 20th century the currently recorded number of cubans with chinese ancestry is 114,240 afro-cubans are descended primarily from the yoruba people as well as several thousand north african refugees most notably the sahrawi arabs of western sahara immigration and emigration main article spanish immigration to cuba immigration

russian dutch greek british and irish as well as small number of descendants of u.s citizens who arrived in cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries post-revolution cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration which has led to a large and influential diaspora community during the three decades after january 1959 more than one million cubans of all social classes — constituting 10 of the total population — emigrated to the united states a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the u.s from the caribbean as a whole during that period other common destinations include spain the united kingdom canada mexico and sweden among others those who left the country typically did so by sea in small boats and fragile rafts on september 9 1994 the u.s and

cuba in september 2015 prior to each papal visit the cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture the governments relaxation of restrictions on house churches in the 1990s led to an explosion of pentecostalism with some groups claiming as many as 100,000 members however mainline evangelical sects organized into the umbrella cuban council of churches remain much more powerful the religious landscape of cuba is also strongly defined by syncretisms of various kinds christianity is often practiced in tandem with santería a mixture of catholicism and mostly african faiths which
