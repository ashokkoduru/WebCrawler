the natural step is a non-profit non-governmental organisation founded in sweden in 1989 by scientist karl-henrik robèrt and the natural step is also used when referring to the partially open source framework it developed following publication of the brundtland report in 1987 robèrt developed the natural step framework setting out the system conditions for the sustainability of human activities on earth robèrts four system conditions are derived from a scientific understanding of universal laws and the aspects of our socio-ecological system including the laws of gravity the laws of thermodynamics and a multitude of social studies the natural step has pioneered a backcasting from principles approach meant to advance society towards greater sustainability whole-systems thinking and backcasting from sustainability principles form the basis for numerous applications and tools to plan and re-design organisational strategy organisational processes productservice innovation and business models its biggest advantage is the concept of simplification without reduction to prevent getting lost in the details with the complex topic of sustainability for almost 30 years the approach has been implemented proven and refined in education research businesses municipalities regional and national governments inter-governmental organisations e.g un eu and a multitude of ngos around the world currently the natural step has offices in 11 countries and numerous associates and ambassadors in more than 50 countries next to the five level framework and the tns framework or framework for strategic sustainable development the tns theory of change shows an integrated cascaded approach to accelerate change towards a sustainable society by collaboration on individual organisational and multi-stakeholder system level change programs and transition labs include futurefitbusiness.org and the alberta canada energyfutureslab towards sustainability sustainability essentially means preserving life on earth including humanity  or the well-being of the socio-ecological system and its subsystems over time as also expressed in the 1987 our common future report a.k.a the brundtland report meeting the needs of humans is central in sustainable development however it does not state which needs attempting to satisfy those human needs whether real or created also are the root causes of many of societal incl ecological challenges we face today the natural step differs between fundamental human needs and their satisfiers manfred max-neef and between real needs and created desires the natural step believes the root causes for unsustainability should be taken into account when designing for sustainable solutions and satisfaction of fundamental needs these root causes are derived from a scientific understanding of our socio-ecological systems  the interactions between humans in society and between humans their organisations and the ecosystem it was found that ecosystem functions and processes are systematically altered in the following ways thereby degrading the ecosystem services and resources they provide society mines and disperses materials from the lithospere into the biosphere faster than they are returned to the earths crust examples include oil coal minerals such as phosphors and metals such as mercury and lead society produces and concentrates substances faster than they can be broken down by natural processes — if they can be broken down at all examples of such substances include plastics gmos dioxins ddt and pcbs society encroaches on ecosystems faster than they can regenerate for example over-harvesting of natural resources incl trees fish fresh water or by other forms of ecosystem manipulation for example paving over fertile land or causing soil erosion simultaneously societal systems can be degraded by several factors thereby eroding trust in the systems and trust in the individuals organisations and institutes it consists of society allows structural obstacles to health of individuals in the system influence of how the system is organised competence development to understand context and to become the best one can be impartiality equal treatment and meaning-making a larger purpose framework overview the 5 level framework 5lf is a comprehensive model for planning and decision making in complex systems based on whole systems thinking it comprises 5 levels 1 system 2 success 3 strategic 4 actions and 5 tools it can be used to analyze any complex system of any type or scale e.g human body the game of chess or soccer an organization a sustainability concept and helps to plan decide and act strategically towards success based on principles determined by the working of the system e.g treat cancer win chess or soccer manage a successful business design useful tools when the 5lf is applied to the socio-ecological system or society within the biosphere it is called the natural step framework or the framework for strategic sustainable development fssd as a framework it helps to see the big picture of the workings and functions of our ecological and social systems and institutions current trends and our sustainability challenge how we as a society negatively influence the functioning of the socio-ecological system system what systems conditions should be met for it to not to be negatively influenced success and how to strategically plan towards that strategic with prioritised actions actions selecting or designing and applying the appropriate tools for those tools since its creation by dr karl henrik robert in 1989 the framework has been reviewed by many scientists is under constant development and has been an inspiration to other tools and concepts in the area of sustainable development the framework has been tested in hundreds of organizations businesses governments neighborhoods ngos around the world based on experience with the framework specific guidelines methods and applications have been developed and refined to accelerate and improve the application of the framework fssd system level the sustainability challenge to explain the sustainability challenge the metaphor of a funnel is used the walls closing in represent the many systematic and often exponentially increasing trends of e.g decreasing number and quality of natural resources and ecosystems the stricter laws and regulations degrading interpersonal and person-to-person trust increasing toxicity levels growing human population increase in demands for resources etc the walls of the funnel are getting closer and closer over time limiting the room to maneuver individuals organisations and society are hitting the walls of the funnel over time e.g victims of climate change related weather events stricter laws and regulations depleting fish stocks increased number of cancer occurrences air water soil pollution erosion of trust financial crises bankruptcies due to price increases of scarce resources land erosion etc overview of the science  systems functions behind the framework there is a science based understanding of the dynamic interrelationships within and between socio-ecological sub-systems and is based a.o on study of ecosystems laws of nature including thermodynamics conservation laws laws of gravity biogeochemical cycles photosynthesis systems thinking flows of resources and wastes social systems social institutions including trust and fundamental human needs psychology in order to be able to create a structured overview and not to be confused with more downstream or detailed information only the logic of the concepts are explained here ecological system earths biosphere is an open system with regards to energy energy comes in the form of sunlight and energy leaves in the form of heat radiation earths biosphere is a relatively closed system regarding matter some meteorites and dust enter and only limited matter leaves due to gravity e.g some space rockets dust the first and second laws of thermodynamics lotd and laws for conservation of matter lcom set limiting conditions for life on earth the first law says that energy is conserved nothing disappears its form simply changes e.g heat movement another way of stating this is energy cannot be created or destroyed only modified in form the implications of the second law and second law of conservation of matter are that matter and energy tend to disperse over time for matter this is referred to as entropy putting the different laws together and applying them to our planetary system the following facts become apparent all the matter that will ever exist on earth is here now 1st lcom disorder increases in all closed systems and the earth is a closed system with respect to matter 2nd lcom however it is an open system with respect to energy since it receives energy from the sun sunlight or energy radiation lotd is responsible for almost all increases in net material quality on the planet through photosynthesis and solar heating effects chloroplasts in plant cells take energy and minerals and oxygen from sunlight for plant growth sugars structure oxygen plants in turn provide energy for other forms of life such as animals evaporation of water from the oceans by solar heating produces most of the earths fresh water this flow of energy from the sun creates structure and order from the disorder the global ecosystem and its local ecosystems evolved over time into a complex adaptive system with many interdependencies social system a social sub-system also is a complex adaptive system trust is essential in the smooth workings of societal systems and can be seen as the glue binding society economically politically socially a lack of trust e.g in the future and each other creates societal unrest and instability as individuals and sub-systems within society will attempt to continue to satisfy individual fundamental human needs needs as articulated by manfred max-neef among others being able to keep ones health influence of how the system is organised learn develop to become the best one can be equal treatment and pursuing a larger purpose are important factors to trust and believe in the system one is part of human influence based on the whole-system understanding and research focusing on the causes rather than the effects of unsustainability within the socio-ecological system lead to 4 main causes of unsustainability systematic increases in concentrations of substances extracted from the earths crust e.g mining of fossil fuels metals minerals systematic increases in concentrations of substances produced by society e.g creation of plastics toxins purified substances sugar nanochemicals systematic increases in physical degradation of ecosystems e.g deforestation over-harvesting fishing methods unnatural barriers introduction of exotic species leakages of extracted or created substances systematic increases in setting barriers for peoples capacity to meet their needs e.g inequality discrimination long working hours access to healthcare torture right to demonstrate or vote land grabbing corruption deny education previously these were called system conditions to be met to not to degrade the socio-ecological system fssd success level in 1989 robèrt wrote a paper describing the system conditions for sustainability given these laws of nature amongst others he sent it to 50 scientists asking that they tell him what was wrong with his paper on version 22 robèrt had scientific consensus on what was to become the natural step framework since then there have been 2 more rounds of scientific consensus on the framework one was initiated by paul hawken in the usa 1994 one took place in australia since the initial version several changes to the wording of the principles have been made 2001 2006 2015 sustainability principles the current fssds definition of sustainability includes four sustainability principles first order scientific principles that describe a sustainable society within the ecological system in a sustainable society nature is not subject to systematically increasing concentrations of … … substances extracted from the earths crust … substances produced as a byproduct of society  … degradation by physical means and in that society people are not subject to structural obstacles to health influence competence impartiality and meaning-making.missimer et al.,2015 the 4th sustainability principle was recently replaced by the latest scientific research previously the 4th principle was stated as and in that society… people are not subject to conditions that systematically undermine their capacity to meet their needs.henrik ny et al 2006 the four sustainability principles can be reworded to simplify understanding and to apply to any society organization or product in short to become a sustainable society we must … eliminate our contribution to the progressive buildup of substances extracted from the earths crust … eliminate our contribution to the progressive buildup of chemicals and compounds produced by society … eliminate our contribution to the progressive physical degradation and destruction of nature and natural processes and … eliminate our contribution to structural obstacles to health influence competence impartiality and meaning-making 4 the negative wording is often debated as the use of not can have a negative emotional connotation as in a game with game rules it doesnt tell you everything you should do they leave that up to the imagination of the players they allow you to do anything as long as it is within all agreed rules of the game the restrictions set by these rules of the game stimulate creativity as they are applied in personal professional or community planning and decision-making on the success level organizations institutes and individuals add their own secondary principles of success based on their specific context or needs fssd  strategic level strategic often confused with strategy to be able to be strategic one needs to know where one wants to be or where one is heading backcasting the framework bases its planning approach on a concept called backcasting and more specifically backcasting from sustainability principles backcasting is the process of moving backwards from an imagined vision of success one begins with an end in mind moves backwards from the vision to the present and moves step-by-step towards the vision it is essentially placing ourselves in the future imagining that we have achieved success and looking back to ask the question “what do we need to do today to reach that successful outcome” instead of picturing how success could look like backcasting is advocated from a principled vision of success in which specific conditions are met creates a shared understanding of success different general strategies can be applied to reach success based on a general understanding of the system incl dematerialisation across the entire life cycle of a product or process substitution of materials that do not comply with the sustainability principles by those that do applying the precautionary principle applying the golden rule do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you fssd  actions the actions that you can do within the strategy to reach success within the system e.g raise awareness on specific sustainability topics education programs on what sustainability is and how it could be approached selecting different suppliers based on sustainability criteria designing or implementing policies analyze the life cycle of a product create a sustainability report facilitate a dialogue with specific stakeholders around a particular challenge etc fssd  tools level a variety of tools and concepts can be supportive when addressing sustainability informed by the framework and priorities of actions can help to select and implement the appropriate tools tools can then be optimally used for the purpose they were designed to do together with other complimentary tools abcd method the abcd method is the approach with which the framework backcasting from the 4 sustainability principles can be applied to an organization the letters represent the following steps fssd academic abcd and tns abcd method differ slightly a awareness and visioning after understanding the system your organization works within and the principles members of the organization create a vision on how they would like the organization to be organisations should also identify the service they provide independent of the product sparking more creative goals b baseline assessment the organisation analyses and maps what it has been doing currently and evaluates it based on the 4 principles it allows for the organisation to identify critical issues implications and opportunities c creative solutions members of the organisation brainstorm for solutions to the issues raised previously without constraint with the vision and potential actions organisations backcast to develop strategies for sustainability d decide on priorities the organisation prioritizes the different actions developed previously that help gear it to sustainability in the fastest and most optimal way by asking a set of questions by asking i does this action move us in the right direction ii can this action be built upon in future iii does this action bring an acceptable financial ecological andor social return on investment this step involves step-by-step implementation and planning backcasting is continually used to assess and evaluate the actions to determine if the organisation is moving towards the vision set in a interfaces with other tools and concepts much research has been done on the interfacing of the fssd with other known tools and concepts within the sustainable development arena interfaces with most sustainability tools and concepts have been described below various examples factor x factor 4 factor 10 biological footprinting is0 14001 emas ems 1 global reporting initiative  mind the gap strategically driving gri sustainability reporting towards sustainability tools based on the framework furthermore various tools and other forms of support have been developed by and in collaboration with tns others have been inspired by or based upon the tns framework some more rigorous than others below various examples future-fit business benchmark co-developed with tns practitioners strategic life cycle assessment slca living building challenge lbc sustainable apparel coalition materials sustainability index as developed by nike in collaboration with tns applications of the framework the framework is applicable to organisations of any sector size location processes products services business models it can be used to analyse other sustainability tools and concepts and strengthens other tools by placing them in the context and focus on what they are designed to do when applied correctly also the business case for sustainability and the sustainability case for business are taken into account to create inspiring cases and best practices on making change happen in an article in in context 1991 robèrt described how the natural step framework would create change eco-municipalities based on the natural steps system conditions originated in sweden over 80 municipalities and several regions 25 percent of all swedish municipalities have adopted the tns sustainability principles based on the system conditions there are now 12 eco-municipalities in the united states and the american planning association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles communities such as whistler and dawson creek next to the province of alberta and british columbia canada also corporations such as interface nike inc ici paints scandic hotels max hamburgers and ikea have adopted the framework and have become more sustainable as a result each of these companies have completely re-thought their business and have examined and changed all their processes including purchase of materials manufacturing transportation construction of facilities maintenance and waste management the natural step was introduced to the northwest through three one-day conferences
