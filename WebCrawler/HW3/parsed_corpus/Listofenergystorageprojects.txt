this is a list of energy storage projects worldwide many individual energy storage projects augment electrical grids by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an electrical grid the energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or low-cost energy typically during night time for conversion into resources such as hot water cool water or ice which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour kwh such thermal energy storage is often employed at end-user sites such as large buildings and also as part of district heating thus shifting energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand some notable energy storage projects include sir adam beck hydroelectric generating stations bear swamp hydroelectric power station seneca pumped storage generating station salina pumped storage project carters dam smith mountain dam and matanoagawa dam system types forms of energy storage mechanical compressed air energy storage flywheel energy storage gravitational potential energy storage pumped hydroelectric storage phs or pumped storage hydropower psh see pumped-storage hydroelectricity thermal cool water hot water or ice thermal storage see thermal energy storage and seasonal thermal energy storage liquid air or liquid nitrogen energy storage see cryogenic energy storage molten salt storage chemical battery battery energy storage system bess flow battery secondary battery see rechargeable battery hydrogen storage power to gas electromagnetic storage coil superconducting storage coil see superconducting magnetic energy storage projects and sites listing this is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness you can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries see also distributed generation energy energy density energy reduction assets energy storage challenge grid energy storage hybrid renewable energy system list of concentrating solar thermal power companies list of energy topics list of geothermal power stations list of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations list of solar thermal power stations lists of wind farms by country power transmission pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations category u.s doe international energy storage database external links u.s dept of energy  energy storage systems u.s dept of energy  energy storage systems database the worlds pumped storage plants stations de pompage turbinage dans le monde
