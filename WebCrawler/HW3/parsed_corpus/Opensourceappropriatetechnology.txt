appropriate technology designed in the same fashion as free and open-source software osat refers to on the one hand technology designed with special consideration to the environmental ethical cultural social political and economic aspects of the community it is intended for on the other hand osat is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used modified and distributed freely benefits open source is a development method for appropriate technology that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process appropedia is an example of open-source appropriate technology there anyone can both learn how to make and use at free of concerns about patents at the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas observations experimental data deployment logs etc it has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive applied sustainability is enormous the built in continuous peer-review can result in better quality higher reliability and more flexibility than conventional designpatenting of technologies the free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture finally osat also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in this is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the developing world the open-source model can act as a driver of sustainable development there are at least three good reasons it enables production as well as consumption it enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products it can be free as in gratis as well as free as in libre an important consideration for developing communities following the lateral scaling concepts of jeremy rifkin ethical considerations for solutions many researchers companies and academics do work on products meant to assist sustainable development vinay gupta has suggested that those developers agree to three principles i will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive any works that i patent i will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities i will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances the ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth support in the literature it has been investigated how open sharing of designs specifications and technical information can enhance effectiveness widespread use and innovation of appropriate technology osat has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development osat has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world it has been claimed that the sharing of design processes appropriate tools and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions in addition it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standardslicenses document knowledge and build on previous work in education at the university level the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging the connection between physics and social benefit this approach has the potential to use university students access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology similarly osat has been used as a tool for improving service learning mit has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using appropriate technology education and its relation to osat it has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source 3d printers can enable a new method of development for osat open source scientific equipment open source hardware for science can also be considered osat hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared recently 2014 open source labs have been proposed evaluation appropriate technology is designed to promote decentralized labor-intensive energy-efficient and environmentally sound businesses carroll pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985 due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness large private utilities and multinational construction companies recently 2011 several barriers to osat deployment have been identified at seen as inferior or poor persons technology technical transferability and robustness of at insufficient funding weak institutional support the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty see also applied
