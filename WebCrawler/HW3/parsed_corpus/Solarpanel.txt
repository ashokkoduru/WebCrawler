solar panel refers to a panel designed to absorb the suns rays as a source of energy for generating electricity or heating a photovoltaic pv module is a packaged connect assembly of typically 6×10 solar cells solar photovoltaic panels constitute the solar array of a photovoltaic system that generates and supplies solar electricity in commercial and residential applications each module is rated by its dc output power under standard test conditions and typically ranges from 100 to 365 watts the efficiency of a module determines the area of a module given the same rated output – an 8 efficient 230 watt module will have twice the area of a 16 efficient 230 watt module there are a few commercially available solar panels available that exceed 22 efficiency and reportedly also exceeding 24 a single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power most installations contain multiple modules a photovoltaic system typically includes a panel or an array of solar modules a solar inverter and sometimes a battery andor solar tracker and interconnection wiring the price of solar power has continued to fall so that in many countries it is cheaper than ordinary fossil fuel electricity from the grid there is grid parity theory and construction see also solar cell solar modules use light energy photons from the sun to generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect the majority of modules use wafer-based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells based on cadmium telluride or silicon the structural load carrying member of a module can either be the top layer or the back layer cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moisture most solar modules are rigid but semi-flexible ones are available based on thin-film cells electrical connections are made in series to achieve a desired output voltage andor in parallel to provide a desired current capability the conducting wires that take the current off the modules may contain silver copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals the cells must be connected electrically to one another and to the rest of the system externally popular terrestrial usage photovoltaic modules use mc3 older or mc4 connectors to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system bypass diodes may be incorporated or used externally in case of partial module shading to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated some recent solar module designs include concentrators in which light is focused by lenses or mirrors onto an array of smaller cells this enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area such as gallium arsenide in a cost-effective way there is also hotspot effect in solar modules in which two sides of cells are connected two diodes this prevents solar modules or panels from short circuit efficiencies see also solar cell efficiency depending on construction photovoltaic modules can produce electricity from a range of frequencies of light but usually cannot cover the entire solar range specifically ultraviolet infrared and low or diffused light hence much of the incident sunlight energy is wasted by solar modules and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with monochromatic light therefore another design concept is to split the light into different wavelength ranges and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges this has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50 scientists from spectrolab a subsidiary of boeing have reported development of multi-junction solar cells with an efficiency of more than 40 a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells the spectrolab scientists also predict that concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45 or even 50 in the future with theoretical efficiencies being about 58 in cells with more than three junctions currently the best achieved sunlight conversion rate solar module efficiency is around 21.5 in new commercial products typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolation the most efficient mass-produced solar modules have power density values of up to 175 wm 16.22 wft research by imperial college london has shown that the efficiency of a solar panel can be improved by studding the light-receiving semiconductor surface with aluminum nanocylinders similar to the ridges on lego blocks the scattered light then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor which means that more photons can be absorbed and converted into current although these nanocylinders have been used previously aluminum was preceded by gold and silver the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface this the research argued could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver the research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without compromising power conversion efficiencies thus reducing material consumption efficiencies of solar panel can be calculated by mpp maximum power point value of solar panels solar inverters convert the dc power to ac power by performing mppt process solar inverter samples the output power i-v curve from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance load to solar cells to obtain maximum power mpp maximum power point of the solar panel consists of mpp voltage v mpp and mpp current i mpp it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher mpp micro-inverted solar panels are wired in parallel which produces more output than normal panels which are wired in series with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel this is known as the christmas light effect micro-inverters work independently so each panel contributes its maximum possible output given the available sunlight technology main articles crystalline silicon and thin film solar cell most solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon c-si solar cells made of multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon in 2013 crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide pv production while the rest of the overall market is made up of thin-film technologies using cadmium telluride cigs and amorphous silicon emerging third generation solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells they produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies also high-cost high-efficiency and close-packed rectangular multi-junction mj cells are preferably used in solar panels on spacecraft as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space mj-cells are compound semiconductors and made of gallium arsenide gaas and other semiconductor materials another emerging pv technology using mj-cells is concentrator photovoltaics cpv  thin film in rigid thin-film modules the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line the cell is created on a glass substrate or superstrate and the electrical connections are created in situ a so-called monolithic integration the substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back sheet usually another sheet of glass the main cell technologies in this category are cdte or a-si or a-siuc-si tandem or cigs or variant amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6–12 flexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the photoactive layer and other necessary layers on a flexible substrate if the substrate is an insulator e.g polyester or polyimide film then monolithic integration can be used if it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used the cells are assembled into modules by laminating them to a transparent colourless fluoropolymer on the front side typically etfe or fep and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side smart solar modules main articles smart module and solar micro-inverter several companies have begun embedding electronics into pv modules this enables performing maximum power point tracking mppt for each module individually and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level some of these solutions make use of power optimizers a dc-to-dc converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems as of about 2010 such electronics can also compensate for shading effects wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero performance and degradation module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions stc irradiance of 1,000 wm² solar spectrum of am 1.5 and module temperature at 25 °c electrical characteristics include nominal power pmax measured in w open circuit voltage voc short circuit current isc measured in amperes maximum power voltage vmpp maximum power current impp peak power watt-peak wp and module efficiency  nominal voltage refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries the actual voltage output of the module changes as lighting temperature and load conditions change so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates nominal voltage allows users at a glance to make sure the module is compatible with a given system open circuit voltage or voc is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system voc can be measured with a voltmeter directly on an illuminated modules terminals or on its disconnected cable the peak power rating wp is the maximum output under standard test conditions not the maximum possible output typical modules which could measure approximately 1 meters or 2 feet will be rated from as low as 75 watts to as high as 350 watts depending on their efficiency at the time of testing the test modules are binned according to their test results and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 watt increments and either rate them at  3 5 3-0 or 5-0 solar modules must withstand rain hail heavy snow load and cycles of heat and cold for many years many crystalline silicon module manufacturers offer a warranty that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90 of rated power output and 25 years at 80 potential induced degradation also called pid is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules caused by so-called stray currents this effect may cause power loss of up to 30 percent the largest challenge of photovoltaic technology is the efficiencies of such solar systems while utilizing such systems draws a great interest due to the long term returns of profit the efficacy needs to come a long way before making it plausible to be introduced in all consumers of electricity the problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of doping the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons chemicals such as boron p-type are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor bands in doing so the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 ev to 0.05 ev since the potential difference eb is so low the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures this allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons solar power allows for greater efficiency than heat such as the generation of energy in heat engines the drawback with heat is that most of the heat created is lost to the surroundings thermal efficiency is as defined η t h ≡ w o u t q i n 1 − q o u t q i n displaystyle eta thequiv frac woutqin1-frac qoutqin due to the inherent irreversibility of heat production for useful work efficiency levels are decreased on the other hand with solar panels there isnt a requirement to retain any heat and there are no drawbacks such as friction maintenance solar panel conversion efficiency typically in the 20 percent range is reduced by dust grime pollen and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel a dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30 percent in high dustpollen or desert areas says seamus curran associate professor of physics at the university of houston and director of the institute for nanoenergy which specializes in the design engineering and assembly of nanostructures paying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment researchers found panels that hadn’t been cleaned or rained on for 145 days during a summer drought in california lost only 7.4 percent of their efficiency overall for a typical residential solar system of 5 kilowatts washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere 20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends—in about 2 ½ months for larger commercial rooftop systems the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels on average panels lost a little less than 0.05 percent of their overall efficiency per day recycling most parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 97 of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules recycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules silicon based modules aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process the module is then crushed in a mill and the different fractions are separated  glass plastics and metals it is possible to recover more than 80 of the incoming weight this process can be performed by flat glass recyclers since morphology and composition of a pv module is similar to those flat glasses used in the building and automotive industry the recovered glass for example is readily accepted by the glass foam and glass insulation industry non-silicon based modules they require specific recycling technologies such as the use of chemical baths in order to separate the different semiconductor materials for cadmium telluride modules the recycling process begins by crushing the module and subsequently separating the different fractions this recycling process is designed to recover up to 90 of the glass and 95 of the semiconductor materials contained some commercial-scale recycling facilities have been created in recent years by private companies since 2010 there is an annual european conference bringing together manufacturers recyclers and researchers to look at the future of pv module recycling production see also list of photovoltaics companies in 2010 15.9 gw of solar pv system installations were completed with solar pv pricing survey and market research company pvinsights reporting growth of 117.8 in solar pv installation on a year-on-year basis with over 100 year-on-year growth in pv system installation pv module makers dramatically increased their shipments of solar modules in 2010 they actively expanded their capacity and turned themselves into gigawatt gw players according to pvinsights five of the top ten pv module companies in 2010 are gw players suntech first solar sharp yingli and trina solar are gw producers now and most of them doubled their shipments in 2010 the basis of producing solar panels revolves around the use of silicon cells these silicon cells are typically 10-20 efficient at converting sunlight into electricity with newer production models now exceeding 22 in order for solar panels to become more efficient researchers across the world have been trying to develop new technologies to make solar panels more effective at turning sunlight into energy in 2014 the worlds top ten solar module producers in terms of shipped capacity during the calendar year of 2014 were trina solar yingli sharp solar and canadian solar price see also grid parity average pricing information divides in three pricing categories those buying small quantities modules of all sizes in the kilowatt range annually mid-range buyers typically up to 10 mwp annually and large quantity buyers self-explanatory—and with access to the lowest prices over the long term there is clearly a systematic reduction in the price of cells and modules for example in 2012 it was estimated that the quantity cost per watt was about us0.60 which was 250 times lower than the cost in 1970 of us150 a 2015 study shows pricekwh dropping by 10 per year since 1980 and predicts that solar could contribute 20 of total electricity consumption by 2030 whereas the international energy agency predicts 16 by 2050 real world energy production costs depend a great deal on local weather conditions in a cloudy country such as the united kingdom the cost per produced kwh is higher than in sunnier countries like spain following to rmi balance-of-system bos elements this is non-module cost of non-microinverter solar modules as wiring converters racking systems and various components make up about half of the total costs of installations for merchant solar power stations where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network the cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price this point is sometimes called wholesale grid parity or busbar parity some photovoltaic systems such as rooftop installations can supply power directly to an electricity user in these cases the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption this situation is sometimes called retail grid parity socket parity or dynamic grid parity research carried out by un-energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices such as italy spain and australia and areas using diesel generators have reached retail grid parity mounting and tracking main articles photovoltaic mounting system and solar tracker ground mounted photovoltaic system are usually large utility-scale solar power plants their solar modules are held in place by racks or frames that are attached to ground based mounting supports ground based mounting supports include pole mounts which are driven directly into the ground or embedded in concrete foundation mounts such as concrete slabs or poured footings ballasted footing mounts such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the solar module system in position and do not require ground penetration this type of mounting system is well suited for sites where excavation is not possible such as capped landfills and simplifies decommissioning or relocation of solar module systems roof-mounted solar power systems consist of solar modules held in place by racks or frames attached to roof-based mounting supports roof-based mounting supports include pole mounts which are attached directly to the roof structure and may use additional rails for attaching the module racking or frames ballasted footing mounts such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the panel system in position and do not require through penetration this mounting method allows for decommissioning or relocation of solar panel systems with no adverse effect on the roof structure all wiring connecting adjacent solar modules to the energy harvesting equipment must be installed according to local electrical codes and should be run in a conduit appropriate for the climate conditions solar trackers increase the amount of energy produced per module at a cost of mechanical complexity and need for maintenance they sense the direction of the sun and tilt or rotate the modules as needed for maximum exposure to the light alternatively fixed racks hold modules stationary as the sun moves across the sky the fixed rack sets the angle at which the module is held tilt angles equivalent to an installations latitude are common most of these fixed racks are set on poles above ground panels that face west or east may provide slightly lower energy but evens out the supply and may provide more power during peak demand
