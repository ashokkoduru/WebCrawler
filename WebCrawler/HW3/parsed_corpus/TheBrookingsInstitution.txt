scale study commissioned by president franklin d roosevelt to understand the underlying causes of the depression brookingss first president harold moulton and other brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose president roosevelts new deal policies because they thought such measures were impeding economic recovery with the entry into world war ii in 1941 brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization in 1948 brookings was asked to submit a plan for the administration of the european recovery program the resulting organization scheme assured that the marshall plan was run carefully and on a businesslike basis in 1952 robert calkins succeeded moulton as president of the brookings institution he secured grants

unaware of the brand new rule when he presented and settled with the brookings institute immediately after the presentation when they brought it to his attention litans defenders continue to point out
