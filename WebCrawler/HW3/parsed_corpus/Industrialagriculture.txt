intensive farming or intensive agriculture also known as industrial agriculture is characterized by a low fallow ratio and higher use of inputs such as capital and labour per unit land area this is in contrast to traditional agriculture in which the inputs per unit land are lower intensive animal husbandry involves either large numbers of animals raised on limited land usually confined animal feeding operations cafo often referred to as factory farms or managed intensive rotational grazing mirg both increase the yields of food and fiber per acre as compared to traditional animal husbandry in a cafo feed is brought to the animals which are seldom moved while in mirg the animals are repeatedly moved to fresh forage intensive crop agriculture is characterised by innovations designed to increase yield techniques include planting multiple crops per year reducing the frequency of fallow years and improving cultivars it also involves increased use of fertilizers plant growth regulators pesticides and mechanization controlled by increased and more detailed analysis of growing conditions including weather soil water weeds and pests this system is supported by ongoing innovation in agricultural machinery and farming methods genetic technology techniques for achieving economies of scale logistics and data collection and analysis technology intensive farms are widespread in developed nations and increasingly prevalent worldwide most of the meat dairy eggs fruits and vegetables available in supermarkets are produced by such farms smaller intensive farms usually include higher inputs of labor and more often use sustainable intensive methods the farming practices commonly found on such farms are referred to as appropriate technology these farms are less widespread in both developed countries and worldwide but are growing more rapidly most of the food available in specialty markets such as farmers markets is produced by these smallholder farms history main articles agriculture § modern developments and british agricultural revolution agricultural development in britain between the 16th century and the mid-19th century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output this in turn supported unprecedented population growth freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution historians cited enclosure mechanization four-field crop rotation and selective breeding as the most important innovations industrial agriculture arose along with the industrial revolution by the early 19th century agricultural techniques implements seed stocks and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages the industrialization phase involved a continuing process of mechanization horse-drawn machinery such as the mccormick reaper revolutionized harvesting while inventions such as the cotton gin reduced the cost of processing during this same period farmers began to use steam-powered threshers and tractors although they were expensive and dangerous in 1892 the first gasoline-powered tractor was successfully developed and in 1923 the international harvester farmall tractor became the first all-purpose tractor marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines mechanical harvesters combines planters transplanters and other equipment were then developed further revolutionizing agriculture these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms the identification of nitrogen potassium and phosphorus npk as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers further increasing crop yields in 1909 the haber-bosch method to synthesize ammonium nitrate was first demonstrated npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture due to concerns that they came with serious side effects such as soil compaction soil erosion and declines in overall soil fertility along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply the identification of carbon as a critical factor in plant growth and soil health particularly in the form of humus led to so-called sustainable agriculture alternative forms of intensive agriculture that also surpass traditional agriculture without side effects or health issues farmers adopting this approach were initially referred to as humus farmers later as organic farmers the discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition in the first two decades of the 20th century led to vitamin supplements which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements chemicals developed for use in world war ii gave rise to synthetic pesticides following world war ii synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly while sustainable intensive farming advanced much more slowly most of the resources in developed nations went to improving industrial intensive farming and very little went to improving organic farming thus particularly in the developed nations industrial intensive farming grew to become the dominant form of agriculture the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines facilitated raising livestock in cafos by reducing diseases caused by crowding developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made long-distance distribution feasible between 1700 and 1980 the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466 and yields increased dramatically particularly because of selectively bred high-yielding varieties fertilizers pesticides irrigation and machinery global agricultural production doubled between 1820 1920 between 1920 and 1950 between 1950 and 1965 and again between 1965 and 1975 to feed a global population that grew from one billion in 1800 to 6.5 billion in 2002 the number of people involved in farming in industrial countries dropped from 24 percent of the american population to 1.5 percent in 2002 in 1940 each farmworker supplied 11 consumers whereas in 2002 each worker supplied 90 consumers the number of farms also decreased and their ownership became more concentrated in 2000 in the u.s four companies produced 81 percent of cows 73 percent of sheep 57 percent of pigs and 50 percent of chickens cited as an example of vertical integration by the president of the u.s national farmers union between 1967 and 2002 the one million pig farms in america consolidated into 114,000 with 80 million pigs out of 95 million produced each year on factory farms according to the u.s national pork producers council according to the worldwatch institute 74 percent of the worlds poultry 43 percent of beef and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture which has become associated with decreased soil quality and over the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides have not subsided alternatives such as integrated pest management ipm have had little impact because policies encourage the use of pesticides and ipm is knowledge-intensive these concerns sustained the organic movement and caused a resurgence in sustainable intensive farming and funding for the development of appropriate technology famines continued throughout the 20th century through the effects of climactic events government policy war and crop failure millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s techniques and technologies livestock main article intensive animal farming confined animal feeding operations intensive livestock farming also called factory farming is a term referring to the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density concentrated animal feeding operations cafo or intensive livestock operations can hold large numbers some up to hundreds of thousands of cows hogs turkeys or chickens often indoors the essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space the aim is to provide maximum output at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest level of food safety the term is often used pejoratively however cafos have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide both in terms of total food produced and efficiency food and water is delivered to the animals and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents vitamin supplements and growth hormones are often employed growth hormones are not used on chickens nor on any animal in the european union undesirable behaviours often related to the stress of confinement led to a search for docile breeds e.g with natural dominance behaviours bred out physical restraints to stop interaction such as individual cages for chickens or physically modification such as the de-beaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting the cafo designation resulted from the 1972 us federal clean water act which was enacted to protect and restore lakes and rivers to a fishable swimmable quality the united states environmental protection agency epa identified certain animal feeding operations along with many other types of industry as point source groundwater polluters these operations were subjected to regulation in 17 states in the u.s isolated cases of groundwater contamination were linked to cafos for example the ten million hogs in north carolina generate 19 million tons of waste per year the u.s federal government acknowledges the waste disposal issue and requires that animal waste be stored in lagoons these lagoons can be as large as 7.5 acres 30,000 m lagoons not protected with an impermeable liner can leak into groundwater under some conditions as can runoff from manure used as fertilizer a lagoon that burst in 1995 released 25 million gallons of nitrous sludge in north carolinas new river the spill allegedly killed eight to ten million fish the large concentration of animals animal waste and dead animals in a small space poses ethical issues to some consumers animal rights and animal welfare activists have charged that intensive animal rearing is cruel to animals other concerns include persistent noxious odor the effects on human health and the role of antibiotics use in the rise of resistant infectious bacteria according to the u.s centers for disease control and prevention cdc farms on which animals are intensively reared can cause adverse health reactions in farm workers workers may develop acute andor chronic lung disease musculoskeletal injuries and may catch zoonotic infections from the animals managed intensive rotational grazing main article managed intensive rotational grazing managed intensive rotational grazing mirg also known as cell grazing mob grazing and holistic managed planned grazing is a variety of forage use in which herdsflocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh rested grazing areas to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth mirg can be used with cattle sheep goats pigs chickens turkeys ducks and other animals the herds graze one portion of pasture or a paddock while allowing the others to recover resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves rebuild shoot systems and deepen root systems resulting in long-term maximum biomass production mirg is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems mirg also leave parasites behind to die off minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements and with the increased productivity of mirg systems the animals obtain the majority of their nutritional needs in some cases all without the supplemental feed sources that are required in continuous grazing systems or cafos crops main article intensive crop farming the green revolution transformed farming in many developing countries it spread technologies that had already existed but had not been widely used outside of industrialized nations these technologies included miracle seeds pesticides irrigation and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer seeds in the 1970s scientists created strains of maize wheat and rice that are generally referred to as high-yielding varieties hyv hyvs have an increased nitrogen-absorbing potential compared to other varieties since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge fall over before harvest semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes norin 10 wheat a variety developed by orville vogel from japanese dwarf wheat varieties was instrumental in developing wheat cultivars ir8 the first widely implemented hyv rice to be developed by the international rice research institute was created through a cross between an indonesian variety named “peta” and a chinese variety named “dee geo woo gen.” with the availability of molecular genetics in arabidopsis and rice the mutant genes responsible reduced height rht gibberellin insensitive gai1 and slender rice slr1 have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of gibberellic acid a phytohormone involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more mechanically stable nutrients become redirected to grain production amplifying in particular the yield effect of chemical fertilisers hyvs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation pesticides and fertilizers in the absence of these inputs traditional varieties may outperform hyvs they were developed as f1 hybrids meaning seeds need to be purchased every season to obtain maximum benefit thus increasing costs crop rotation main article crop rotation crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped crop rotation also seeks to balance the nutrient demands of various crops to avoid soil nutrient depletion a traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of legumes and green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops crop rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants one technique is to plant multi-species cover crops between commercial crops this combines the advantages of intensive farming with continuous cover and polyculture irrigation main article irrigation crop irrigation accounts for 70 of the worlds fresh water use flood irrigation the oldest and most common type is typically unevenly distributed as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts overhead irrigation using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type but delivers water to plant roots with minimal losses water catchment management measures include recharge pits which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge groundwater supplies this helps in the replenishment of groundwater wells and eventually reduces soil erosion dammed rivers creating reservoirs store water for irrigation and other uses over large areas smaller areas sometimes use irrigation ponds or groundwater weed control main article weed control in agriculture systematic weed management is usually required often performed by machines such as cultivators or liquid herbicide sprayers herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the crop relatively unharmed some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones weed control through herbicide is made more difficult when the weeds become resistant to the herbicide solutions include cover crops especially those with allelopathic properties that out-compete weeds or inhibit their regeneration multiple herbicides in combination or in rotation strains genetically engineered for herbicide tolerance locally adapted strains that tolerate or out-compete weeds tilling ground cover such as mulch or plastic manual removal mowing grazing burning terracing main article terrace agriculture in agriculture a terrace is a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of irrigation water often such land is formed into multiple terraces giving a stepped appearance the human landscapes of rice cultivation in terraces that follow the natural contours of the escarpments like contour ploughing is a classic feature of the island of bali and the banaue rice terraces in banaue ifugao philippines in peru the inca made use of otherwise unusable slopes by drystone walling to create terraces rice paddies main article paddy field a paddy field is a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing rice and other semiaquatic crops paddy fields are a typical feature of rice-growing countries of east and southeast asia including malaysia china sri lanka myanmar thailand korea japan vietnam taiwan indonesia india and the philippines they are also found in other rice-growing regions such as piedmont italy the camargue france and the artibonite valley haiti they can occur naturally along rivers or marshes or can be constructed even on hillsides they require large water quantities for irrigation much of it from flooding it gives an environment favourable to the strain of rice being grown and is hostile to many species of weeds as the only draft animal species which is comfortable in wetlands the water buffalo is in widespread use in asian rice paddies paddy-based rice-farming has been practiced in korea since ancient times a pit-house at the daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period c 3500-2000 bc in the korean peninsula the earliest rice cultivation there may have used dry-fields instead of paddies the earliest mumun features were usually located in naturally swampy low-lying narrow gulleys and fed by local streams some mumun paddies in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles separated by bunds approximately 10 cm in height while terraced paddies consisted of long irregularly shapes that followed natural contours of the land at various levels like todays mumun period rice farmers used terracing bunds canals and small reservoirs some paddy-farming techniques of the middle mumun c 850-550 bc can be interpreted from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice paddies at the majeon-ni site however iron tools for paddy-farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 bc the spatial scale of individual paddies and thus entire paddy-fields increased with the regular use of iron tools in the three kingdoms of korea period c ad 300400-668 a recent development in the intensive production of rice is system of rice intensification sri developed in 1983 by the french jesuit father henri de laulanié in madagascar by 2013 the number of smallholder farmers using sri had grown to between 4 and 5 million aquaculture main article aquaculture aquaculture is the cultivation of the natural products of water fish shellfish algae seaweed and other aquatic organisms intensive aquaculture takes place on land using tanks ponds or other controlled systems or in the ocean using cages sustainable intensive farming main articles sustainable farming integrated multi-trophic aquaculture zero waste agriculture and organic farming sustainable intensive farming practises have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services while still offering high yields most of these developments fall in the category of organic farming or the integration of organic and conventional agriculture organic systems and the practices that make them effective are being picked up more and more by conventional agriculture and will become the foundation for future farming systems they wont be called organic because theyll still use some chemicals and still use some fertilizers but theyll function much more like todays organic systems than todays conventional systems dr charles benbrook executive director us house agriculture subcommittee director agricultural board  national academy sciences fmr the system of crop intensification sci was born out of research primarily at cornell university and smallholder farms in india on sri it uses the sri concepts and methods for rice and applies them to crops like wheat sugarcane finger millet and others it can be 100 organic or integrated with reduced conventional inputs holistic management is a systems thinking approach that was originally developed for reversing desertification holistic planned grazing is similar to rotational grazing but differs in that it more explicitly provides a framework for adapting to four basic ecosystem processes the water cycle the mineral cycle including the carbon cycle energy flow and community dynamics the relationship between organisms in an ecosystem as equal in importance to livestock production and social welfare by intensively managing the behavior and movement of livestock holistic planned grazing simultaneously increases stocking rates and restores grazing land pasture cropping plants grain crops directly into grassland without first applying herbicides the perennial grasses form a living mulch understory to the grain crop eliminating the need to plant cover crops after harvest the pasture is intensively grazed both before and after grain production using holistic planned grazing this intensive system yields equivalent farmer profits partly from increased livestock forage while building new topsoil and sequestering up to 33 tons of co2hayear the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production developed in partnership with usda-sare is similar to pasture cropping but the crops planted into the perennial pasture are forage crops for dairy herds this system improves milk production and is more sustainable than confinement dairy production integrated multi-trophic aquaculture imta is an example of a holistic approach imta is a practice in which the by-products wastes from one species are recycled to become inputs fertilizers food for another fed aquaculture e.g fish shrimp is combined with inorganic extractive e.g seaweed and organic extractive e.g shellfish aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability biomitigation economic stability product diversification and risk reduction and social acceptability better management practices biointensive agriculture focuses on maximizing efficiency such as per unit area energy input and water input agroforestry combines agriculture and orchardforestry technologies to create more integrated diverse productive profitable healthy and sustainable land-use systems intercropping can increase yields or reduce inputs and thus represents potentially sustainable agricultural intensification however while total yield per acre is often increased dramatically yields of any single crop often diminish there are also challenges to farmers relying on farming equipment optimized for monoculture often resulting in increased labor inputs vertical farming is intensive crop production on a large scale in urban centers in multi-story artificially-lit structures that uses far less inputs and produces fewer environmental impacts an integrated farming system is a progressive biologically integrated sustainable agriculture system such as imta or zero waste agriculture whose implementation requires exacting knowledge of the interactions of multiple species and whose benefits include sustainability and increased profitability elements of this integration can include intentionally introducing flowering plants into agricultural ecosystems to increase pollen-and nectar-resources required by natural enemies of insect pests using crop rotation and cover crops to suppress nematodes in potatoes challenges see also agricultural policy and agribusiness the challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society for the industrial agriculture sector for the individual farm and for animal rights include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices this is a continuation of thousands of years of invention in feeding ever growing populations when hunter-gatherers with growing populations depleted the stocks of game and wild foods across the near east they were forced to introduce agriculture but agriculture brought much longer hours of work and a less rich diet than hunter-gatherers enjoyed further population growth among shifting slash-and-burn farmers led to shorter fallow periods falling yields and soil erosion plowing and fertilizers were introduced to deal with these problems  but once again involved longer hours of work

agriculture is to profitably supply the world at the lowest cost industrial methods have significant side effects further industrial agriculture is not an indivisible whole but instead is composed of multiple elements each of which can be modified in response to market conditions government regulation and further innovation and has its own side-effects various interest groups reach different conclusions on the subject benefits population growth see also world population and history of agriculture very roughly 30,000 years ago hunter-gatherer behavior fed 6 million people 3,000 years ago

agriculture providing cheap and plentiful food is the u.s.s most successful program of agricultural development of any country in the world between 1930 and 2000 u.s agricultural productivity output divided by all inputs rose by an average of about 2 percent annually causing food prices to decrease the percentage of u.s disposable income spent on food prepared at home decreased from 22 percent as late as 1950 to 7 percent by the end of the century liabilities environment main article environmental impact of agriculture industrial agriculture uses huge amounts of water energy and industrial chemicals increasing pollution in the arable land usable water and atmosphere herbicides insecticides and fertilizers are accumulating in ground and surface waters many of the negative effects of industrial agriculture are remote from fields and farms nitrogen compounds from the midwest for example travel down the mississippi to degrade coastal fisheries in the gulf of mexico but other adverse effects are showing up within agricultural production systems  for example the rapidly developing resistance among pests is rendering our arsenal of herbicides and insecticides increasingly
