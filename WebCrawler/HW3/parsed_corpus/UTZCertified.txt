that a consumer product with an utz certified logo does indeed credibly link to an utz certified producer the utz certified program contains chain of custody requirements this is a set of chain-wide administrative logistical and technical requirements for traceability these requirements include criteria for separation of utz certified products and conventionalnon-utz certified products and keeping records of direct suppliers and buyers traceability utz certified coffee cocoa and tea is traceable through the supply chain as utz uses a web-based traceability system when an utz certified producer sells his products e.g coffee cocoa tea to a registered utz certified buyer the product is announced in the utz certified web-based system by doing so the seller announces when he is shipping what amount to whom the buyer then gets notified and needs to confirm this in the traceability system utz certified assigns a unique tracking number to this lot at the end of the supply chain the end product manufacturer uses the unique tracking number to know his product credibly links to a certified source some brands use this unique tracking system to make the product traceable for their consumers traceability services traceability services utz certified has developed implemented and is currently managing the traceability system for the roundtable on sustainable palm oil this system was launched in december 2008 certification independent third party auditors make annual inspections to ensure coffee producers comply with the code of conduct a certification body cb is an independent third-party certifier when approved by utz certified these organizations conduct annual certification inspections of coffee cocoa and tea producers to determine whether they comply with the utz certified code of conduct and chain of custody requirements an utz certified trained agronomist is a technical consultant specifically trained in assisting producers to comply with the utz certified code of conduct trained agronomists can advise on practical implementation of elements of the code and give directions on improvement of efficiency in farm management impact in 2014 utz certified published its first impact report this brought together 24 external studies and data collected by utz certified it demonstrated that utz certified cocoa coffee and tea farms generate higher yields and better quality crops than conventional farms and being trained in the utz code of conduct helps farmers to improve their knowledge and adopt sustainable farming practices pricing coffee cocoa and tea with an utz certification has added value in the sense that it assures buyers that it has been produced according to an internationally recognized standard for responsible production i.e according to the utz certified code of conduct the price for utz certified coffee is determined in the negotiation process between buyer and seller utz certified does not interfere in price negotiations in contrast to fair trade no minimum purchase price is set instead the focus on good agricultural practices in the utz program is intended to enable farmers to increase the quantity and quality of their yield and thus to increase their income criticism utz certified certification like the rainforest alliance coffee certification program has been criticized because it offers producers no minimum or guaranteed price for their crop some consider utz certified producer organizations to be vulnerable to the volatility of the coffee market the price difference and the fact companies do not pay any marketing costs for logo use makes the utz certified label considerably cheaper than fairtrade for companies and farmers interested in tapping the ethical market michael conroy an independent consultant on certification for sustainable development criticized utz certified in his 2007 book branded the environmental standards of utz certified are far weaker than those of either fairtrade or rainforest alliance utz certifieds standards for example explicitly announces that genetically modified coffee plants though not at present available would be allowable so long as farmers obey local regulations on their use any kind of chemical fertilizer may be used as long as an external technically qualified advisor has determined the quantity of fertilizer to be used no chemical pesticides or fungicides banned in the european union the u.s or japan may be used but any that are acceptable in those three markets are acceptable on coffee farms if they are applied according to the label in july 2012 german magazine Ökotest published an article labeling utz certified among others as unfair due to a lack of pre-financing and guaranteed minimum purchase prices in response utz certified stated that the foundation does not consider its standards fair trade nor that it claims that they are while maintaining that its standards contribute positively to sustainable development
