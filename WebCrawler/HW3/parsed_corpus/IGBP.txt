the international geosphere-biosphere programme igbp was a research programme that studies the phenomenon of global change it closed in 2015 the international council of scientific unions a coordinating body of national science organizations launched igbp in 1986 it looked at the total earth system the changes that are occurring and the manner in which changes are influenced by human actions igbp aimed to describe and understand how the physical chemical and biological processes regulate the earth system it also seeks to increase knowledge of how humans are influencing the global processes such as the carbon cycle nitrogen cycle sulfur cycle water cycle and phosphorus cycle it delivers scientific knowledge to help human societies develop in harmony with earths environment igbp research is organised around six projects representing the earth system  land atmosphere ocean and where they meet land-atmosphere land-ocean atmosphere-ocean and two further projects looking at the earth system as a whole past global changes pages which looks at palaeoclimate and the analysis integration and modelling of the earth system aimes which helps set the agenda for earth system models plus four joint projects  carbon water human health and food security  with the other three international global-change programmes in 2004 igbp published a landmark synthesis global change and the earth system steffen et al the synthesis stated that humanity was now the main driver of change at the planetary scale and that earth is now operating in a no analogue state measurements of earth system processes past and present have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least sybil seitzinger is the executive director igbp projects analysis integration and modeling of the earth system aimes global ocean ecosystem dynamics globec global land project glp international global atmospheric chemistry igac integrated land ecosystemâ€“atmosphere processes study ileaps integrated marine biogeochemistry and ecosystem research imber land-ocean interaction in the coastal zone loicz past global changes pages surface ocean lower atmosphere study solas igbp joint projects global carbon project global land project global environmental change and human health gechh global environmental change and food systems gecafs global water system project gwsp international partners earth system science partnership world climate research programme diversitas international human dimensions programme see also systems geology external links
