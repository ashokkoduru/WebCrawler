a chlorofluorocarbon cfc is an organic compound that contains only carbon chlorine and fluorine produced as volatile derivative of methane ethane and propane they are also commonly known by the dupont brand name freon the most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane r-12 or freon-12 many cfcs have been widely used as refrigerants propellants in aerosol applications and solvents because cfcs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the montreal protocol and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons hfcs e.g r-410a and r-134a structure properties and production main article organofluorine chemistry as in simpler alkanes carbon in the cfcs bonds with tetrahedral symmetry because the fluorine and chlorine atoms differ greatly in size and effective charge from hydrogen and from each other the methane-derived cfcs deviate from perfect tetrahedral symmetry the physical properties of cfcs and hcfcs are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the halogen atoms in general they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes the decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the halides which induces intermolecular interactions thus methane boils at −161 °c whereas the fluoromethanes boil between −51.7 cf2h2 and −128 °c cf4 the cfcs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride because of their polarity the cfcs are useful solvents and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants the cfcs are far less flammable than methane in part because they contain fewer c-h bonds and in part because in the case of the chlorides and bromides the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames the densities of cfcs are higher than their corresponding alkanes in general the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides cfcs and hcfcs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes illustrative is the synthesis of chlorodifluoromethane from chloroform the brominated derivatives are generated by free-radical reactions of the chlorofluorocarbons replacing c-h bonds with c-br bonds the production of the anesthetic 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane halothane is illustrative reactions the most important reaction of the cfcs is the photo-induced scission of a c-cl bond the chlorine atom written often as cl behaves very differently from the chlorine molecule cl2 the radical cl is long-lived in the upper atmosphere where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into o2 ozone absorbs uv-b radiation so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the earths surface bromine atoms are even more efficient catalysts hence brominated cfcs are also regulated applications applications exploit the low toxicity low reactivity and low flammability of the cfcs and hcfcs every permutation of fluorine chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized furthermore many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine uses include refrigerants blowing agents propellants in medicinal applications and degreasing solvents billions of kilograms of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as precursor to tetrafluoroethylene the monomer that is converted into teflon classes of compounds nomenclature chlorofluorocarbons cfcs when derived from methane and ethane these compounds have the formulae cclmf4-m and c2clmf6-m where m is nonzero hydro-chlorofluorocarbons hcfcs when derived from methane and ethane these compounds have the formula cclmfnh4-m-n and c2clxfyh6-x-y where m n x and y are nonzero and bromofluorocarbons have formulae similar to the cfcs and hcfcs but also include bromine hydrofluorocarbons hfcs when derived from methane ethane propane and butane these compounds have the respective formulae cfmh4-m c2fmh6-m c3fmh8-m and c4fmh10-m where m is nonzero numbering system main article refrigerant § refrigerants by class a numbering system is used for fluorinated alkanes prefixed with freon r cfc and hcfc the rightmost value indicates the number of fluorine atoms the next value to the left is the number of hydrogen atoms plus 1 and the next value to the left is the number of carbon atoms less one zeroes are not stated remaining atoms are chlorine thus freon-12 indicates a methane derivative only two numbers containing two fluorine atoms the second 2 and no hydrogen 1-10 it is therefore ccl2f2 another easier equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the cfcrfreon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it the resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms the rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms the value of this equation is always a three figure number an easy example is that of cfc-12 which gives 9012102  1 carbon 0 hydrogens 2 fluorine atoms and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in ccl2f2 the main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule freons containing bromine are signified by four numbers isomers which are common for ethane and propane derivatives are indicated by letters following the numbers history carbon tetrachloride ccl4 was used in fire extinguishers and glass anti-fire grenades from the late nineteenth century until around the end of world war ii experimentation with chloroalkanes for fire suppression on military aircraft began at least as early as the 1920s freon is a trade name for a group of cfcs which are used primarily as refrigerants but also have uses in fire-fighting and as propellants in aerosol cans bromomethane is widely used as a fumigant dichloromethane is a versatile industrial solvent the belgian scientist frédéric swarts pioneered the synthesis of cfcs in the 1890s he developed an effective exchange agent to replace chloride in carbon tetrachloride with fluoride to synthesize cfc-11 ccl3f and cfc-12 ccl2f2 in the late 1920s thomas midgley jr improved the process of synthesis and led the effort to use cfc as refrigerant to replace ammonia nh3 chloromethane ch3cl and sulfur dioxide so2 which are toxic but were in common use in searching for a new refrigerant requirements for the compound were low boiling point low toxicity and to be generally non-reactive in a demonstration for the american chemical society midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle in 1930 commercial development and use during world war ii various chloroalkanes were in standard use in military aircraft although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity nevertheless after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well in the 1960s fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials much early research with halon 1301 was conducted under the auspices of the us armed forces while halon 1211 was initially mainly developed in the uk by the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property including computer rooms telecommunications switches laboratories museums and art collections beginning with warships in the 1970s bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel by the early 1980s bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft ships and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries however concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the ozone layer the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought at the time that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact and too important to human safety for restriction regulation since the late 1970s the use of cfcs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer after the development of his electron capture detector james lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of cfcs in the air finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of cfc-11 over ireland in a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973 lovelock went on to measure cfc-11 in both the arctic and antarctic finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected and concluding that cfcs are not hazardous to the environment the experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of cfcs in the atmosphere the damage caused by cfcs was discovered by sherry rowland and mario molina who after hearing a lecture on the subject of lovelocks work embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 it turns out that one of cfcs most attractive features—their low reactivity— is key to their most destructive effects cfcs lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere once in the stratosphere the suns ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the c-cl bond by 1987 in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica diplomats in montreal forged a treaty the montreal protocol which called for drastic reductions in the production of cfcs on 2 march 1989 12 european community nations agreed to ban the production of all cfcs by the end of the century in 1990 diplomats met in london and voted to significantly strengthen the montreal protocol by calling for a complete elimination of cfcs by the year 2000 by the year 2010 cfcs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well because the only cfcs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling their prices have increased considerably a worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material however there are current cfc smuggling issues as recognized by the united nations environmental programme unep in a 2006 report titled illegal trade in ozone depleting substances unep estimates that between 16,000–38,000 tonnes of cfcs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s the report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of cfcs are smuggled annually into developing countries asian countries are those with the most smuggling as of 2007 china india and south korea were found to account for around 70 of global cfc production south korea later to ban cfc production in 2010 possible reasons for continued cfc smuggling were also examined the report noted that many banned cfc producing products have long lifespans and continue to operate the cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance additionally cfc smuggling is not considered a significant issue so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low while the eventual phaseout of cfcs is likely efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems by the time of the montreal protocol it was realised that deliberate and accidental discharges during system tests and maintenance accounted for substantially larger volumes than emergency discharges and consequently halons were brought into the treaty albeit with many exceptions regulatory gap while the production and consumption of cfcs are regulated under the montreal protocol emissions from existing banks of cfcs are not regulated under the agreement in 2002 there were an estimated 5,791 kilotons of cfcs in existing products such as refrigerators air conditioners aerosol cans and others approximately one-third of these cfcs are projected to be emitted over the next decade if action is not taken posing a threat to both the ozone layer and the climate a proportion of these cfcs can be safely captured and destroyed regulation and dupont in 1978 the united states banned the use of cfcs such as freon in aerosol cans the beginning of a long series of regulatory actions against their use the critical dupont manufacturing patent for freon process for fluorinating halohydrocarbons u.s patent 3258500 was set to expire in 1979 in conjunction with other industrial peers dupont sponsored efforts such as the alliance for responsible cfc policy to question anti-cfc science but in a turnabout in 1986 dupont with new patents in hand publicly condemned cfcs dupont representatives appeared before the montreal protocol urging that cfcs be banned worldwide and stated that their new hcfcs would meet the worldwide demand for refrigerants phasing-out of cfcs use of certain chloroalkanes as solvents for large scale application such as dry cleaning have been phased out for example by the ippc directive on greenhouse gases in 1994 and by the volatile organic compounds voc directive of the eu in 1997 permitted chlorofluoroalkane uses are medicinal only bromofluoroalkanes have been largely phased out and the possession of equipment for their use is prohibited in some countries like the netherlands and belgium from 1 january 2004 based on the montreal protocol and guidelines of the european union production of new stocks ceased in most probably all countries in 1994 however many countries still require aircraft to be fitted with halon fire suppression systems because no safe and completely satisfactory alternative has been discovered for this application there are also a few other highly specialized uses these programs recycle halon through halon banks coordinated by the halon recycling corporation to ensure that discharge to the atmosphere occurs only in a genuine emergency and to conserve remaining stocks the interim replacements for cfcs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs which deplete stratospheric ozone but to a much lesser extent than cfcs ultimately hydrofluorocarbons hfcs will replace hcfcs unlike cfcs and hcfcs hfcs have an ozone depletion potential odp of 0 dupont began producing hydrofluorocarbons as alternatives to freon in the 1980s these included suva refrigerants and dymel propellants natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning hydrofluorocarbons are included in the kyoto protocol because of their very high global warming potential and are facing calls to be regulated under the montreal protocol due to the recognition of halocarbon contributions to climate change on 21 september 2007 approximately 200 countries agreed to accelerate the elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbons entirely by 2020 in a united nations-sponsored montreal summit developing nations were given until 2030 many nations such as the united states and china who had previously resisted such efforts agreed with the accelerated phase out schedule development of alternatives for cfcs work on alternatives for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigerants began in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to stratospheric ozone were published the hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer nevertheless a significant fraction of the hcfcs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted later alternatives lacking the chlorine the hydrofluorocarbons hfcs have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere one of these compounds hfc-134a is now used in place of cfc-12 in automobile air conditioners hydrocarbon refrigerants a propaneisobutane blend are also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in australia the usa and many other countries as they have excellent thermodynamic properties and perform particularly well in high ambient temperatures one of the natural refrigerants along with ammonia and carbon dioxide hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners various other solvents and methods have replaced the use of cfcs in laboratory analytics environmental impacts as previously discussed cfcs were phased out via the montreal protocol due to their part in ozone depletion however the atmospheric impacts of cfcs are not limited to its role as an active ozone reducer this anthropogenic compound is also a greenhouse gas with a much higher potential to enhance the greenhouse effect than co2 infrared absorption bands trap heat from escaping earths atmosphere in the case of cfcs the strongest of these bands are located in the spectral region 7.8–15.3 µm – referred to as an atmospheric window due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region the strength of cfc bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere at which the compound absorbs and emits radiation are two factors that contribute to cfcs super greenhouse effect another such factor is the low concentration of the compound because co2 is close to saturation with high concentrations it takes more of the substance to enhance the greenhouse effect conversely the low concentration of cfcs allow their effects to increase linearly with mass tracer of ocean circulation because the time history of cfc concentrations in the atmosphere is relatively well known they have provided an important constraint on ocean circulation cfcs dissolve in seawater at the ocean surface and are subsequently transported into the ocean interior because cfcs are inert their concentration in the ocean interior reflects simply the convolution of their atmospheric time evolution and ocean circulation and mixing cfc and sf6 tracer-derived age of ocean water chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are anthropogenic compounds that have been released into the atmosphere since the 1930s in various applications such as in air-conditioning refrigeration blowing agents in foams insulations and packing materials propellants in aerosol cans and as solvents the entry of cfcs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as transient tracers to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes however due to production restrictions of cfcs in the 1980s atmospheric concentrations of cfc-11 and cfc-12 has stopped increasing and the cfc-11 to cfc-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing making water dating of water masses more problematic incidentally production and release of sulfur hexafluoride sf6 have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s similar to cfcs sf6 is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities thus using cfcs in concert with sf6 as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased cfc concentrations using cfcs or sf6 as a tracer of ocean circulation allows for the derivation of rates for ocean processes due to the time-dependent source function the elapsed time since a subsurface water mass was last in contact with the atmosphere is the tracer-derived age estimates of age can be derived based on the partial pressure of an individual compound and the ratio of the partial pressure of cfcs to each other or sf6 partial pressure and ratio dating techniques the age of a water parcel can be estimated by the cfc partial pressure pcfc age or sf6 partial pressure psf6 age the pcfc age of a water sample is defined as pcfc cfcft,s where cfc is the measured cfc concentration pmol kg and f is the solubility of cfc gas in seawater as a function of temperature and salinity the cfc partial pressure is expressed in units of 10–12 atmospheres or parts-per-trillion ppt the solubility measurements of cfc-11 and cfc-12 have been previously measured by warner and weiss additionally the solubility measurement of cfc-113 was measured by bu and warner and sf6 by wanninkhof et al and bullister et al theses authors mentioned above have expressed the solubility f at a total pressure of 1 atm as ln f a1 a2100t a3lnt100 a4t100 sb1 b2t100 b3t100 where f solubility expressed in either mol l or mol kg atm t absolute temperature s salinity in parts per thousand ppt a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 and b3 are constants to be determined from the least squares fit to the solubility measurements this equation is derived from the integrated van t hoff equation and the logarithmic setchenow salinity dependence it can be noted that the solubility of cfcs increase with decreasing temperature at approximately 1 per degree celsius once the partial pressure of the cfc or sf6 is derived it is then compared to the atmospheric time histories for cfc-11 cfc-12 or sf6 in which the pcfc directly corresponds to the year with the same the difference between the corresponding date and the collection date of the seawater sample is the average age for the water parcel the age of a parcel of water can also be calculated using the ratio of two cfc partial pressures or the ratio of the sf6 partial pressure to a cfc partial pressure safety according to their material safety data sheets cfcs and hcfcs are colorless volatile toxic liquids and gases with a faintly sweet ethereal odor
