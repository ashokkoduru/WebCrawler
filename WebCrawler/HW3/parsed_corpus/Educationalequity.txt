educational equity also referred to as equity in education is a measure of achievement fairness and opportunity in education the study of education equity is often linked with the study of excellence and equity educational equity is dependent on two main factors the first is fairness which implies that factors specific to ones personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success the second important factor is inclusion which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system these two factors are closely related and are dependent on each other for true academic success of an educational system the growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual’s level of education directly correlates to future quality of life therefore an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving however inequity in education is challenging to avoid and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing race gender or disability equity vs equality often the terms equity and equality are interchanged when referring to educational equity although similar there can be important distinctions between the two equity equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle examples of this are “when libraries offer literacy programs when schools offer courses in english as a second language and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice” equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not equity aims at making sure that everyones lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods social justice leaders in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students equality the american library association defines equality as “access to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all a level playing field is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.” in this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it however this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by socio-economic equity in education income and class income has always played an important role in shaping academic success those who come from a family of a higher socioeconomic status ses are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower ses those who come from a higher ses can afford things like better tutors rigorous satact prep classes impressive summer programs and so on parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers levitsky parents of a higher ses are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their childs chances of acceptance along with other extravagant measures this creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier costs of education the extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the united states makes an attempt at a level playing field for all students not so level high-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend selective schools that better prepare a student for later success because of this low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified in addition neighborhoods generally segregated by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools for higher-quality schooling students in low-income areas would be required to take public transport which they do not have the means to pay for fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group fewer than half graduate tracking another contributor to the inequality in the education system is tracking tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans the point of tracking is to create an environment in which the students abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other students in the class this separation however creates an inequality within itself starting at an extremely young age the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take the quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources teachers etc in many cases tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement racial equity in education from a scientific point of view the human species is a single species it is therefore misleading to use divisive terms such as races and racial groups nevertheless the term racial group is enshrined in legislation and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use racial equity in education means the assignment of students to public schools and within schools without regard to their race this includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race the educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education us department of education the commission on equity and excellence in education issues a seminal report in 2013 it is not a restatement of public educations struggles nor is it a mere list of recommendations rather this is a declaration of an urgent national mission to provide equity and excellence in education in american public schools once and for all this collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity and a world-class education for each and every american child a reality the struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic political social history of the peoples who are part of it from the beginning of this nation there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial national origin and language groups not from the dominant culture approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic racial and language minority groups are still evolving asia-pacific region globalization of the economy increasingly diverse and interconnected populations and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike school systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success and the educational strategies and systems required for all children to achieve them within the asia-pacific region for example korea shanghai-china and japan are examples of asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators south africa a major task of south africas new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system during the apartheid era which began when the national party won control of parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later the provision of education was racially unequal by design resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers physical resources and teaching aids such as textbook and stationery the rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record higher education higher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally by embedding race equality in teaching and learning institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students including minority ethnic and international students universities scotland first published the race equality toolkit learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations gender equity in education gender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries especially in developing countries where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women global campaign for education gce followed a survey called gender discrimination in violation of rights of women and girls states that one tenth of girls in primary school are unhappy and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment restorations to freedom and an inherent lack of opportunities compared to boys united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco understands education as a fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights it promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits un special rapporteur katarina tomasevki developed the 4a framework on the right to education the 4a framework encompasses availability accessibility acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education and yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education figure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world countries such as sudan somalia thailand and afghanistan face the highest of inequity when it comes to gender bias gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries a new york times article highlights how education systems especially public school systems tend to segregate boys and girls are often taught with different approach which programs children to think that they are different and deserve different treatment however studies show that boys and girls learn differently and therefore should be taught differently boys learn better when they are kept moving while girls learn better sitting in one place with silence therefore segregation of gender for this reasoning promotes gender equity in education as both boys and girls have optimized learning causes of gender discrimination in education vso is a leading independent international development organization that works towards eliminating poverty and one of the problems they tackle is gender inequity in education vso published a paper that categorizes the obstacles or causes into community level obstacles this category primarily relates to the bias displayed for education external to the school environment this includes restraints due to poverty and child labour soil-economic constraints lack of parental involvement and community participation harmful practices like child marriage and predetermined gender roles are cultural hindrances school and education system level obstacles lack of investment in quality education inappropriate attitudes and behaviors lack of female teachers as role models and lack of gender-friendly school environment are all factors that promote gender inequity in education impact of gender discrimination on the economy education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of a country equity in education increases the work force of the nation therefore increasing national income economic productivity and gross domestic product it reduces fertility and infant mortality improves child health increases life expectancy and increases standards of living these are factors that allow economic stability and growth in the future above all female education can increase output levels and allow countries to attain sustainable development equity in education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women unesco also refers gender equity as a major factor that allows for sustainable development httpwww.economist.comblogsfreeexchange201311gender-inequality is an article published by the economist which says looking at recently-published un statistics on gender inequality in education one observes that the overall picture has improved dramatically over the last decade but progress has not been even see chart although the developing world on average looks likely to hit the un’s gender-inequality target many parts of africa are lagging behind while progress is being made in sub-saharan africa in primary education gender inequality is in fact widening among older children the ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010 whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary

declaration of an urgent national mission to provide equity and excellence in education in american public schools once and for all this collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity and a world-class education for each and every american child a reality carol d lee described the rationale for a special theme issue reconceptualizing race and ethnicity in educational research the rationale includes the historical and contemporary ways that cultural differences have been positioned in educational research and the need for more nuanced and complex analyses of ethnicity and race racial equity in education how far has south africa come a major task of south africa’s new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system this paper evaluates progress towards this goal using three distinct concepts equal treatment equal educational opportunity and educational adequacy the authors find that the country has succeeded in establishing racial equity defined as equal treatment primarily through race-blind policies for allocating state funds for schools progress measured by the other two criteria however has been constrained by the legacy of apartheid including poor facilities and lack of human capacity in schools serving black students and by policies such as school fees race in education an argument for integrative analysis race social class and gender tend to be treated as separate issues in education literature we review a sample of education literature from four academic journals spanning ten years to determine the extent to which these status groups were integrated we found little integration we then provide an example from research on cooperative learning to illustrate how attention to only one status group oversimplifies the analysis of student behavior in school from findings of studies integrating race and class and race and gender we argue that attending only to race in this example oversimplifies behavior analysis and may contribute to perpetuation of gender and class biases to determine to what extent race social class and gender are integrated in the education literature we examined a sample of literature published over a ten-year period and 30 articles focused primarily on race or on school issues related directly to race such as desegregation equity and quality in education supporting disadvantaged students and schools–from oecd the report is by the oecd education directorate with support from the asia society as a background report for the first asia society global cities network symposium hong kong may 10–12 2012 asia society is grateful for oecds leadership in international benchmarking and for our ongoing partnership asia society organized

education systems this report presents the key recommendations of the oecd publication equity and quality in education supporting disadvantaged students and schools 2012a which maps out policy levers that can help build high quality and equitable education systems with a particular focus on north american and asia-pacific countries challenges in educational equity the long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of healthcare income support child welfare and social security societal structure and costs while both basic education and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics while the feminist movement has made great strides for women other groups have not been as fortunate generally social mobility has not increased while economic inequality has so while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind increase migration and diversity as increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries poor social cohesion in other countries is also a major issue in countries where continued migration causes an issue the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity on the other hand many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating minorities challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of both lower academic performance and lower socio-economic status recommendations and solutions schools and teachers play a valuable role in promoting good race relations between people of different racial groups eliminating unlawful racial discrimination and promoting equality of outcomes between these groups but they need support to continue for schools inclusion of race equality concepts in lessons should be seen as a normal part of effective teaching and learning local resources in lessons involving race equality such as work by local black and minority ethnic writers and in the history of local industrialization should be used to stimulate pupils interest and learning from race equality in education one of the quotations there is nothing more important than closing the gap between national averages and the educational attainments of black kids muslim kids travellers and gypsies and most refugee kids but the significance of closing the achievement gap is manifold it is fundamental to building a sense of belonging and to improving a sense of safety amongst all pupils all of which are essential to pursuing race equality in schools from race equality and education for teachers all bullying is wrong and causes recipients great distress teachers should be alert to potential incidences of bullying and intervene when they become aware of it there should be a framework within which all members of staff should operate in their response to such incidences it is not a matter for an individual to deal with on their own whilst there are several similarities between racist bullying and other forms of bullying there are significant differences it is essential that teachers should be aware of these helping children and young people to understand this and to act against unjustifiable inequalities is one of the most important challenges facing teachers atl believes that this publication will help enable teachers to fulfil this role and help schools meet their legal obligations under the race relations amendment act 2000 from race equality and education for governments one of the most efficient educational strategies for governments is to invest early and all the way up to upper secondary governments can prevent school failure and reduce dropout using two parallel approaches eliminating education policies and practices that hinder equity and targeting low performing disadvantaged schools but education policies need to be aligned with other government policies such as housing or welfare to ensure student success at this initial educational stage direct public funding of services is associated with more effective governmental monitoring of early childhood services advantages of scale better quality across the country more effective training for educators and a higher degree of equity in access for society each and every one of us has a personal responsibility to confront these issues and to contribute to a change in societal perceptions and views whilst no one individual can act alone changes in society can be achieved if we all work together discrimination is not limited to skin colour however the experiences expectations and opportunities open to an individual can be as much dependent on their gender age sexual orientation disability or the national cultural and religious traditions into which they were born the task is not easy it can be frequently stressful as it involves confronting and challenging others – children young people their parents and ones colleagues further it also involves confronting and challenging oneself race equality toolkit universities in scotland first published the race equality toolkit – learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations in terms of the race relations amendment act 2000 this resource is designed to assist academic staff particularly those less familiar with race equality issues to embed issues of race equality and of fostering good relations as part of learning and teaching and curriculum design it does not provide a blueprint for how race equality should be addressed in teaching and learning but it encourages the academic staff to self-evaluate and to review the curriculum and their teaching and assessment methods to create as inclusive a learning environment as possible the toolkit therefore encourages the institutions to develop the corporate strategies necessary to support individual lecturers and departments in mainstreaming race equality issues external
