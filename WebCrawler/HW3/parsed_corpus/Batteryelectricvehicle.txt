hybrid and plug-in electric vehicle vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of hybrid electric vehicles and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged operate in charge-sustaining mode and instead they are continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and gasoline fuel are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phev and run as

been in operation since 1992 and have carried 11.3 million passengers and covered a distance of 3,100,000 kilometres 1,900,000 mi they were made locally by advanced vehicle systems two of these buses were used for the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta beginning in the summer of 2000 hong kong airport began operating a 16-passenger mitsubishi rosa electric shuttle bus and in the fall of 2000 new york city began testing a 66-passenger battery-powered school bus an all-electric version of the blue bird tc2000 a similar bus was operated in napa valley california for 14 months ending in april 2004 the 2008 beijing olympics used a fleet of 50 electric buses which have a range of 130 km 81 mi with the air conditioning on they use lithium-ion batteries and consume about 1 kw·hmi 0.62 kw·hkm 2.2 mjkm the buses were designed by the beijing institute of technology and built by the jinghua coach co ltd the batteries are replaced with fully charged ones at the recharging station to allow 24-hour operation of the buses in france the bus electric phenomenon is in development but we already can find some of them in operation in numerous cities of france pvi a medium company located in the paris region is one of the leader of the market with its brand gepebus offering oreos 2x and oreos 4x in the united states the first battery-electric fast-charge bus has been in operation in pomona california since september 2010 at foothill transit the proterra ecoride be35 uses lithium-titanate batteries and is able to fast-charge in less than 10 minutes in 2014 the first production model all-electric school bus was delivered to the kings canyon unified school district in california’s san joaquin valley the bus was one of four the district ordered this battery electric school bus which has 4 sodium nickel batteries is the first modern electric school bus approved for student transportation by any state the same technology is used to power the mountain view community shuttles this technology was supported by the california energy commission and the shuttle program is being supported by google thunder sky thunder sky based in hong kong builds lithium-ion batteries used in submarines and has three models of electric buses the 1021 passenger ev-6700 with a range of 280 km 170 mi under 20 mins quick-charge the ev-2009 city buses and the 43 passenger ev-2008 highway bus

the versatile newton platform that features a walk-in body produced by indiana-based utilimaster electric cars main article electric car see also list of production battery electric vehicles and electric car use by country an electric car is a plug-in battery powered automobile which is propelled by electric motors although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges recharging can also take significant lengths of time for journeys within a single battery charge rather than long journeys electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight electric cars have the potential of significantly reducing city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated with the current us energy mix using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions given the current energy mixes in other countries it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40 percent in the uk 19 percent in china and as little as 1 percent in germany electric cars are expected to have a major impact in the auto industry given advantages in city pollution less dependence on oil and expected rise in gasoline prices world governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components the us has pledged us2.4 billion in federal grants for electric cars and batteries china has announced it will provide us15 billion to initiate an
