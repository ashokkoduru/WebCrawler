onboard fuel for motive power hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles the power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy as of 2014 95 of hydrogen is made from methane it can be produced using renewable sources but that is an expensive process integrated wind-to-hydrogen power to gas plants using electrolysis of water are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough and quantities great enough to compete with traditional energy sources many companies are working to develop technologies that might efficiently exploit the potential of hydrogen energy for use in motor vehicles as of november 2013 there are demonstration fleets of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles undergoing field testing including the chevrolet equinox fuel cell honda fcx clarity hyundai i fcev and mercedes-benz b-class f-cell the drawbacks of hydrogen use are high carbon emissions intensity when produced from natural gas capital cost burden low energy content per unit volume low performance of fuel cell vehicles compared with gasoline vehicles production and compression of hydrogen and the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles vehicles further information fuel cell vehicle buses trains phb bicycles canal boats cargo bikes golf carts motorcycles wheelchairs ships airplanes submarines and rockets can already run on hydrogen in various forms nasa used hydrogen to launch space shuttles into space a working toy model car runs on solar power using a regenerative fuel cell to store energy in the form of hydrogen and oxygen gas it can then convert the fuel back into water to release the solar energy since the advent of hydraulic fracturing the key concern for environmentalists with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is consumer and public policy confusion that could result adoption of natural gas powered hydrogen vehicles with heavy hidden emissions to the detriment of environmentally friendly transportation the current land speed record for a hydrogen-powered vehicle is 286.476 miles per hour 461.038 kmh set by ohio state universitys buckeye bullet 2 which achieved a flying-mile speed of 280.007 miles per hour 450.628 kmh at the bonneville salt flats in august 2008 for production-style vehicles the current record for a hydrogen-powered vehicle is 207.297 miles per hour 333.612 kmh set by a prototype ford fusion hydrogen 999 fuel cell race car at bonneville salt flats in wendover utah in august 2007 it was accompanied by a large compressed oxygen tank to increase power automobiles as of 2016 there are 3 hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets the toyota mirai the hyundai i fcev and the honda clarity toyota launched its first production fuel cell vehicle the mirai in japan at the end of 2014 and began sales in california mainly the los angeles area in 2015 the car has a range of 312 mi 502 km and takes about five minutes to refill its hydrogen tank the initial sale price in japan was about 7 million yen 69,000 former european parliament president pat cox estimates that toyota will initially lose about 100,000 on each mirai sold many automobile companies have introduced demonstration models in limited numbers see list of fuel cell vehicles one disadvantage of hydrogen compared to other automobile fuels is its low density several manufacturers are collaborating on hydrogen technology development with 2013 announcements of bmw leasing technology from toyota and another group formed by ford motor company daimler ag and nissan buses main article fuel cell bus fuel cell buses as opposed to hydrogen fueled buses are being trialed by several manufacturers in different locations the fuel cell bus club is a global fuel cell bus testing collaboration trams in march 2015 china south rail corporation csr demonstrated the worlds first hydrogen fuel cell-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in qingdao the chief engineer of the csr subsidiary csr sifang co ltd liang jianying said that the company is studying how to reduce the running costs of the tram a total of 83 miles of tracks for the new vehicle have been built in seven chinese cities china plans to spend 200 billion yuan 32 billion over the next five years to increase tram tracks to more than 1,200 miles bicycles main article phb bicycle pearl hydrogen power sources of shanghai china unveiled a hydrogen bicycle at the 9th china international exhibition on gas technology equipment and applications in 2007 motorcycles and scooters env develops electric motorcycles powered by a hydrogen fuel cell including the crosscage and biplane other manufacturers as vectrix are working on hydrogen scooters finally hydrogen fuel cell-electric hybrid scooters are being made such as the suzuki burgman fuel cell scooter and the fhybrid the burgman received whole vehicle type approval in the eu the taiwanese company apfct conducted a live street test with 80 fuel cell scooters for taiwans bureau of energy quads and tractors autostudi s.r.ls h-due is a hydrogen-powered quad capable of transporting 1-3 passengers a concept for a hydrogen powered tractor has been proposed airplanes for more details on this topic see hydrogen planes companies such as boeing lange aviation and the german aerospace center pursue hydrogen as fuel for manned and unmanned airplanes in february 2008 boeing tested a manned flight of a small aircraft powered by a hydrogen fuel cell unmanned hydrogen planes have also been tested for large passenger airplanes however the times reported that boeing said that hydrogen fuel cells were unlikely to power the engines of large passenger jet airplanes but could be used as backup or auxiliary power units onboard in july 2010 boeing unveiled its hydrogen powered phantom eye uav powered by two ford internal combustion engines that have been converted to run on hydrogen in britain the reaction engines a2 has been proposed to use the thermodynamic properties of liquid hydrogen to achieve very high speed long distance antipodal flight by burning it in a precooled jet engine fork trucks a hice forklift or hice lift truck is a hydrogen fueled internal combustion engine-powered industrial forklift truck used for lifting and transporting materials the first production hice forklift truck based on the linde x39 diesel was presented at an exposition in hannover on may 27 2008 it used a 2.0 litre 43 kw 58 hp diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and direct injection a fuel cell forklift also called a fuel cell lift truck or a fuel cell forklift is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck in 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in material handling in the us only 500 of these received funding from doe in 2012 the global market is 1 million fork lifts per year as of 2013 fuel cell fleets are being operated by several of companies including sysco foods fedex freight genco at wegmans coca-cola kimberly clark and whole foods and h-e-b grocers a total of 30 fuel cell forklifts with hylift were demonstrated in europe and extended it with hylift-europe to 200 units with other projects in france and austria pike research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020 most companies in europe and the us do not use petroleum powered forklifts as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes fuel cell-powered forklifts can be used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures the fc units are often designed as drop-in replacements rockets many large rockets use liquid hydrogen as fuel with liquid oxygen as an oxidizer an advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high effective exhaust velocity compared to kerosenelox or udmhnto engines according to the tsiolkovsky rocket equation a rocket with higher exhaust velocity needs less propellant mass to achieve a given change of speed before combustion the hydrogen runs through cooling pipes around the exhaust nozzle to protect the nozzle from damage by the hot exhaust gases also the energy content or energy density of hydrogen calculated from weight is the best compared to any other chemical energy storage in combination with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen yields the highest specific impulse or efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed of any known rocket propellant a disadvantage of lh2lox engines are the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed this increases the rockets structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly another disadvantage is the poor storability of lh2lox-powered rockets due to the constant hydrogen boil-off the rocket can only be fueled shortly before launch which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for icbms and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations overall the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage however the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less which makes it particularly effective for upper stages since they are carried by the lower stages for first stages dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag liquid hydrogen and oxygen were also used in the space shuttle to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems the byproduct of the fuel cell is water which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space internal combustion vehicle main articles hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle and list of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles hydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars the hydrogen internal combustion car is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline internal combustion engine car these hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do the main difference is the exhaust product gasoline combustion results in carbon dioxide and water vapour while the only exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapour in 1807 francois isaac de rivaz designed the first hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine in 1965 roger billings then a high school student converted a model a to run on hydrogen in 1970 paul dieges patented a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen us 3844262  mazda has developed wankel engines burning hydrogen the advantage of using an internal combustion engine like wankel and piston engines is the lower cost of retooling for production hice forklift trucks have been demonstrated based on converted diesel internal combustion engines with direct injection fuel cell for more details on this topic see fuel cell fuel cell cost hydrogen fuel cells are relatively expensive to produce as their designs require rare substances such as platinum as a catalyst in 2014 toyota said it would introduce its toyota mirai in japan for less than 70,000 in 2015 former european parliament president pat cox estimates that toyota will initially lose about 100,000 on each mirai sold freezing conditions the problems in early fuel cell designs at low temperatures concerning range and cold start capabilities have been addressed so that they cannot be seen as show-stoppers anymore users in 2014 said that their fuel cell vehicles perform flawlessly in temperatures below zero even with the heaters blasting without significantly reducing range service life the service life of fuel cells is comparable to that of other vehicles pem service life is 7,300 hours under cycling conditions hydrogen hydrogen does not come as a pre-existing source of energy like fossil fuels but is first produced and then stored as a carrier much like a battery a suggested benefit of large-scale deployment of hydrogen vehicles is that it could lead to decreased emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone precursors however as of 2014 95 of hydrogen is made from methane it can be produced using renewable sources but that is an expensive process integrated wind-to-hydrogen power to gas plants using electrolysis of water are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough and quantities great enough to compete with traditional energy sources according to ford motor company when fcvs are run on hydrogen reformed from natural gas using this process they do not provide significant environmental benefits on a well-to-wheels basis due to ghg emissions from the natural gas reformation process while methods of hydrogen production that do not use fossil fuel would be more sustainable currently renewable energy represents only a small percentage of energy generated and power produced from renewable sources can be used in electric vehicles and for non-vehicle applications the challenges facing the use of hydrogen in vehicles include production storage transport and distribution the well-to-wheel efficiency for hydrogen is less than 25 a study sponsored by the u.s department of energy said in 2004 that the well-to-wheel efficiency of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles is even less production for more details on this topic see hydrogen production the molecular hydrogen needed as an on-board fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing natural gas coal by a process known as coal gasification liquefied petroleum gas biomass biomass gasification by a process called thermolysis or as a microbial waste product called biohydrogen or biological hydrogen production 95 of hydrogen is produced using natural gas and 85 of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline hydrogen can also be produced from water by electrolysis at working efficiencies in the 50–60 range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65–70 for the larger plants hydrogen can also be made by chemical reduction using chemical hydrides or aluminum current technologies for manufacturing hydrogen use energy in various forms totaling between 25 and 50 percent of the higher heating value of the hydrogen fuel used to produce compress or liquefy and transmit the hydrogen by pipeline or truck environmental consequences of the production of hydrogen from fossil energy resources include the emission of greenhouse gases a consequence that would also result from the on-board reforming of methanol into hydrogen analyses comparing the environmental consequences of hydrogen production and use in fuel-cell vehicles to the refining of petroleum and combustion in conventional automobile engines do not agree on whether a net reduction of ozone and greenhouse gases would result hydrogen production using renewable energy resources would not create such emissions but the scale of renewable energy production would need to be expanded to be used in producing hydrogen for a significant part of transportation needs as of 2015 33 percent of u.s electricity was produced from renewable sources including 7 from hydro and 20 from nuclear in a few countries renewable sources are being used more widely to produce energy and hydrogen for example iceland is using geothermal power to produce hydrogen and denmark is using wind storage for more details on this topic see hydrogen storage hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy density at ambient conditions equal to about one-third that of methane even when the fuel is stored as liquid hydrogen in a cryogenic tank or in a compressed hydrogen storage tank the volumetric energy density megajoules per liter is small relative to that of gasoline hydrogen has a three times higher specific energy by mass compared to gasoline 143 mjkg versus 46.9 mjkg in 2011 scientists at los alamos national laboratory and university of alabama working with the u.s department of energy found a single-stage method for recharging ammonia borane a hydrogen storage compound the doe has studied hydrogen storage methods focusing on on-board vehicular hydrogen storage systems that will allow for a driving range of 300 miles compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar 5,000 psi and 700 bar 10,000 psi is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles based on type iv carbon-composite technology infrastructure for more details on this topic see hydrogen infrastructure for more details on this topic see hydrogen highway the hydrogen infrastructure consists mainly of industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those found on a hydrogen highway hydrogen stations which are not situated near a hydrogen pipeline can obtain supply via hydrogen tanks compressed hydrogen tube trailers liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production according to gm 70 of the u.s population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little access to hydrogen despite its wide availability for commercial use the distribution of hydrogen fuel for vehicles throughout the u.s would require new hydrogen stations that would cost by some estimates approximately 20 billion dollars and 4.6 billion in the eu other estimates place the cost as high as half trillion dollars in the united states alone as of 2016 there are 23 publicly accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the usa 20 of which are located in california they are mainly sourced by natural gas codes and standards hydrogen codes and standards as well as codes and technical standards for hydrogen safety and the storage of hydrogen have been identified as an institutional barrier to deploying hydrogen technologies and developing a hydrogen economy to enable the commercialization of hydrogen in consumer products new codes and standards must be developed and adopted by federal state and local governments official support us initiatives in 2003 george w bush announced an initiative to promote hydrogen powered vehicles in 2009 president obama and his department of energy secretary steven chu stripped the funding of fuel cell technology due to their belief that the technology was still decades away under heavy criticism the funding was partially restored in 2014 the obama administration announced they want to speed up production and development of hydrogen powered vehicles the press release states that “by partnering with a private sector the obama administration thinks that it can create success stories and help speed up the process” the department of energy is spreading a 7.2 million investment to the states of georgia kansas pennsylvania and tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems companies like the center for transportation and the environment fed ex express air products and chemicals and sprint are invested in the development of these fuel cells fuel cells could also be used in handling equipment such as forklifts as well as telecommunications infrastructure senator byron l dorgan stated in 2013 “the energy and water appropriations bill makes investments in our nation’s efforts to develop safe homegrown energy sources that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil and because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies this bill also restores funding for hydrogen energy research” much work has been done in developing these fuel cell cars the u.s department of energy supports next generation fuel cell systems and they are the nations lead innovative clean energy technologies in june 2013 the doe gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up the technology and another 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes 3 million for minnesota-based 3m to work on membranes with improved durability and performance and 1.5 million for the colorado school of mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes other efforts japan has a strategy for using hydrogen in transport the hydrogen is mainly to be sourced from outside japan norway plans a series of hydrogen refueling stations along the main roads criticism critics claim the time frame for overcoming the technical and economic challenges to implementing wide-scale use of hydrogen cars is likely to last for at least several decades and hydrogen vehicles may never become broadly available they claim that the focus on the use of the hydrogen car is a dangerous detour from more readily available solutions to reducing the use of fossil fuels in vehicles in may 2008 wired news reported that experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming and we cant afford to wait that long in the meantime fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions k g duleep commented that a strong case exists for continuing fuel-efficiency improvements from conventional technology at relatively low cost critiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary who killed the electric car according to former u.s department of energy official joseph romm a hydrogen car is one of the least efficient most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available romm replied not in our lifetime and very possibly never the los angeles times wrote in february 2009 hydrogen fuel-cell technology wont work in cars  any way you look at it hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars the economist magazine in september 2008 quoted robert zubrin the author of energy victory as saying hydrogen is just about the worst possible vehicle fuel the magazine noted the withdrawal of california from earlier goals in march 2008 the california air resources board an agency of californias state government and a bellwether for state governments across america changed its requirement for the number of zero-emission vehicles zevs to be built and sold in california between 2012 and 2014 the revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles the magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of todays gasoline cars on the other hand if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles the washington post asked in november 2009 but why would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over america and stored in auto batteries a december 2009 study at uc davis published in the journal of power sources found that over their lifetimes hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles this agrees with a 2014 analysis the motley fool stated in 2013 that there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles for hydrogen cars relating to transportation storage and most importantly production volkswagens rudolf krebs said in 2013 that no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency the most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity he elaborated hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy but  you need to convert it first into hydrogen with low efficiencies where you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy you then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks which uses more energy and then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss krebs continued in the end from your original 100 percent of electric energy you end up with 30 to 40 percent the business insider commented pure hydrogen can be industrially derived but it takes energy if that energy does not come from renewable sources then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem  another challenge is the lack of infrastructure gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before fcevs become practical and its unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today  compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology fuel cells are still very very expensive in 2014 joseph romm devoted three articles to updating his critiques of hydrogen vehicles he states that fcvs still have not overcome the following issues high cost of the vehicles high fueling cost and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure it would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades most importantly he says fcvs arent green because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced as 95 of it is using the steam reforming process he concludes that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an fcv fleet either now or in the future greentech medias analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014 in 2015 clean technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles so did car throttle another clean technica writer concluded while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage especially seasonal storage it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles comparison with other types of alternative fuel vehicle hydrogen vehicles compete with various proposed alternatives to the modern fossil fuel powered vehicle infrastructure plug-in hybrids main article plug-in hybrid plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or phevs are hybrid vehicles that can be plugged into the electric grid and contain an electric motor and also an internal combustion engine the phev concept augments standard hybrid electric vehicles with the ability to recharge their batteries from an external source enabling increased use of the vehicles electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines the infrastructure required to charge phevs is already in place and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93 efficient this however is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels acdc conversion must take place from the grids ac supply to the phevs dc this is roughly 98 efficient the battery then must be charged as of 2007 the lithium iron phosphate battery was between 80-90 efficient in chargingdischarging the battery needs to be cooled the gm volts battery has 4 coolers and two radiators as of 2009 the total well-to-wheels efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20 although that number could rise to 25 or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy the well-to-wheels efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a phev or ev however is 80 and could be higher in the future—four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways a 2006 article in scientific american argued that phevs rather than hydrogen vehicles would become standard in the automobile industry a december 2009 study at uc davis found that over their lifetimes phevs will emit less carbon than current vehicles while hydrogen cars will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles natural gas main article natural gas vehicle ice-based cng hcng or lng vehicles natural gas vehicles or ngvs use methane natural gas or biogas directly as a fuel source natural gas has a higher energy density than hydrogen gas ngvs using biogas are nearly carbon neutral unlike hydrogen vehicles cng vehicles have been available for many years and there is sufficient infrastructure to provide both commercial and home refueling stations worldwide there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles by the end of 2011 all-electric vehicles main article electric car a 2008 technology review article stated electric cars—and plug-in hybrid cars—have an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity that is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances getting the hydrogen in the car and then running it through a fuel cell—all for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor youll find in an electric car thermodynamically each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process a 2013 comparison of hydrogen and battery electric vehicles agreed with the 25 figure from ulf bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an electric vehicle battery is rapidly coming down and the gap will widen further while there is little existing infrastructure to transport store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place everyones household power sockets are electric vehicle refueling station and the cost of electricity depending on the source is at least 75 cheaper than hydrogen in 2013 the national academy of sciences and doe stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below 17,000 200–250kwh on 300 miles of range in 2013 matthew mench from the university of tennessee stated if we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now we are going to be waiting for a long time navigant research formerly pike research on the other hand forecasts that “lithium-ion costs which are tipping the scales at about 500 per kilowatt hour now could fall to 300 by 2015 and to 180 by 2020.” in 2013 takeshi uchiyamada a designer of the toyota prius stated because of its shortcomings – driving range cost and recharging time – the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars many electric car designs offer limited driving range causing range anxiety for example the 2013 nissan leaf has a range of 75 mi 121 km the 2014 mercedes-benz b-class electric drive has an estimated range of 115 mi 185 km and the tesla model s has a range of up to 265 mi 426 km however most us commutes are 30–40 miles 48–64 km miles per day round trip and in europe most commutes are around 20 kilometres 12 mi round-trip in 2013 the new york times stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen filling stations in the u.s eight of which are in southern california and that bevs cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station the times commented by the time toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan there will be about a half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the united states – and tens of thousands of e.v charging stations in 2013 john swanton of the california air resources board who sees them as complementary technologies stated that evs have the jump on fuel-cell autos which are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago evs are for real consumers no strings attached with evs you have a lot of infrastructure in place the business insider in 2013 commented that if the energy to produce hydrogen does not come from renewable sources then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem  gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before fcevs become practical and its unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today  compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology fuel cells are still very very expensive even compared to battery-powered evs see also external
