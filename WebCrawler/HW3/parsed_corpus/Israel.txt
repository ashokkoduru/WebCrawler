ethnic group rather than an organised state ancestors of the israelites may have included semites native to canaan and the sea peoples mcnutt says it is probably safe to assume that sometime during iron age a population began to identify itself as israelite differentiating itself from the canaanites through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage an emphasis on family history and

expelled from spain in 1492 some communities settled in palestine during the 16th century jewish communities struck roots in the four holy cities—jerusalem tiberias hebron and safed—and in 1697 rabbi

presided over the first zionist congress the second aliyah 1904–14 began after the kishinev pogrom some 40,000 jews settled in palestine although nearly half of them left eventually both the first and

later split off in 1922 the league of nations granted britain a mandate over palestine under terms which included the balfour declaration with its promise to the jews and with similar provisions regarding the arab palestinians the population of the area at this time was predominantly arab and muslim with jews accounting for about 11 and arab christians at about 9.5 of the population the third 1919–23 and fourth aliyahs 1924–29 brought an additional 100,000 jews to palestine finally the rise of nazism and the increasing persecution of jews in 1930s europe led to the fifth aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million jews this was a major cause of the arab revolt of 1936–39 during which the british mandate authorities alongside the zionist militias of haganah and irgun killed 5,032 arabs and wounded 14,760 resulting in over ten percent of the adult male palestinian arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled the british introduced restrictions on jewish immigration to

refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in europe the yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention

from mandatory palestine stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both arabs and jews on 15 may 1947 the general assembly of the newly formed united nations resolved that a committee united nations special committee on palestine unscop be created to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the assembly a report on the question of palestine in the report

september 1947 the jewish agency which was the recognized representative of the jewish community accepted the plan the arab league and arab higher committee of palestine rejected it and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition on the following day 1 december 1947 the arab higher committee proclaimed a three-day strike and arab gangs began attacking jewish targets the jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out but in early april 1948 moved onto the offensive the arab palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 palestinian arabs fled or were expelled on 14 may 1948 the day before the expiration of the british mandate david ben-gurion the head of the jewish agency declared the establishment of a jewish state in eretz-israel to be known as the state of israel

transjordan and iraq—entered what had been british mandatory palestine launching the 1948 arab–israeli war contingents from yemen morocco saudi arabia and sudan joined the war the apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the jewish state at inception and some arab leaders talked about driving the jews into the sea according to benny morris jews felt that the invading arab armies aimed to slaughter the jews the arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed after a year of fighting a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders known as the green line were established jordan annexed what became known as the west bank including east jerusalem and egypt took control of the gaza strip the united nations

acted as a brake on the jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging british interests in egypt in the early years of the state the labor zionist movement led by prime minister david ben-gurion dominated israeli politics the kibbutzim or collective farming communities played a pivotal role in establishing the new state immigration to israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the israeli immigration department and the non-government sponsored mossad lealiyah bet institution for illegal immigration both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the middle east and eastern europe where the lives of jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult mossad lealiyah bet continued to take part in immigration efforts until its disbanding in 1953 an influx of holocaust survivors and jews from arab and muslim lands immigrated to israel during the first 3 years and the number of jews increased from 700,000 to 1,400,000 many of whom faced persecution in their original countries the immigration was in accordance with the one million plan consequently the population of israel rose from 800,000 to two million between 1948 and 1958 between 1948 and 1970 approximately 1,150,000 jewish refugees relocated to israel the immigrants came to israel for differing reasons some believed in a zionist ideology while others moved to escape persecution there were others that did it for the promise of a better life in israel and a small number that were expelled from their homelands such as british and french jews in egypt after the suez crisis some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot by 1952 over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities during this period food clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period the need to solve the crisis led ben-gurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust in 1950 egypt closed the suez canal to israeli shipping and tensions mounted as armed clashes took place along israels borders during the 1950s israel was frequently attacked by palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians mainly from the egyptian-occupied gaza strip leading to several israeli counter-raids in 1956 great britain and france aimed at regaining control of the suez canal which the egyptians had nationalized see the suez crisis the continued blockade of the suez canal and straits of tiran to israeli shipping together with the growing amount of fedayeen attacks against israels southern population and recent arab grave and threatening statements prompted israel to attack egypt israel joined a secret alliance with great britain and france and overran the sinai peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the united nations in return for guarantees of israeli shipping rights in the red sea via the straits of tiran and the canal the war resulted in significant reduction of israeli border infiltration the refugees were often treated differently according to where they had come from jews of european background were treated more favorably than jews from middle eastern and north african countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former with the result that jews newly arrived from arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day in the early 1960s israel

the 2000 camp david summit during the summit barak offered a plan for the establishment of a palestinian state the proposed state included the entirety of the gaza strip and over 90 of the west bank with jerusalem as a shared capital although some argue that the plan was to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the west bank into three blocs which the palestinian delegation likened to south african bantustans a loaded word that was disputed by the israeli and american negotiators each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks after the collapse of the talks and a controversial visit by likud leader ariel sharon to the temple mount the second intifada began some commentators contend that the uprising was pre-planned by yasser arafat due to the collapse of peace
