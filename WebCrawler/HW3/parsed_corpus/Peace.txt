pes itself comes from the latin pax meaning peace compact agreement treaty of peace tranquility absence of hostility harmony the english word came into use in various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the hebrew word shalom which according to jewish theology comes from a hebrew verb meaning to be complete whole although peace is the usual translation however it is an incomplete one because shalom which is also cognate with the arabic salaam has multiple other meanings in addition to peace including justice good health safety well-being prosperity equity security good fortune and friendliness at a personal level peaceful behaviors are kind considerate respectful just and tolerant of others beliefs and behaviors — tending to manifest goodwill this latter understanding of peace

practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as buddhism and hinduism as well as the new age movement inner peace is also the first of four concepts to living life in the rave culture acronym plur satyagraha main article satyagraha satyagraha sanskrit सत्याग्रह satyāgraha is a philosophy and practice of nonviolent resistance developed by mohandas karamchand gandhi he deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for indian independence and also during his earlier struggles in south africa the word satyagraha itself was coined through a public contest that gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in south africa indian opinion when he realized that neither the common contemporary hindu language nor the english language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict according to gandhis autobiography the contest winner was maganlal gandhi presumably no relation who submitted the entry sadagraha which gandhi then modified to satyagraha etymologically this hindic word means truth-firmness and is commonly translated as steadfastness in the truth or truth-force satyagraha theory also influenced martin luther king jr during the campaigns he led during the civil rights movement in the united states the theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable therefore it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace as gandhi wrote they say means are after all means i would say means are after all everything as the means so the end a contemporary quote sometimes attributed to gandhi but also to a j muste sums it up there is no way to peace peace is the way justice and injustice since classical times it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures in his book agricola the roman historian tacitus includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of rome one that tacitus says is by the caledonian chieftain calgacus ends auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium atque ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant to ravage to slaughter to usurp under false titles they call empire and where they make a desert they call it peace — oxford revised translation discussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace is it simple absence of mass organized killing war or does peace require a particular morality and justice just peace a peace must be seen at least in two forms a simple silence of arms absence of war absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations which are characterized by terms such as justice mutual respect respect for law and good will more recently advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive non-violent restorative justice methods and many of those studying the success of these methods including a united nations working group on restorative justice have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace from the late 2000s on a theory of active peace has been proposed which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory long periods of peace see also list of periods of regional peace the longest continuing period of peace among currently existing states is observed in sweden which has had peace since 1814 for 202 years if swedish participation in the wars in afghanistan and libya is not considered after its loss of major parts of the country to russia in the napoleon wars swedish peace may partly be explained by its geographical position partly by non-participation in military alliances during peacetime resulting in a certain level of swedish neutrality during wartime and partly by the periods of relative peace in europe and the world known as pax britannica 1815-1914 and pax europaeapax americana since 1950s other examples of long periods of peace are the isolationistic edo period also known as tokugawa shogunate in japan 1603 to 1868 250

libertarian pacifism to rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political economic or social goals to opposition to violence under any circumstance including defense of self and others

example amongst members of the league of nations union gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the league struggled to respond to challenges from nazi germany fascist italy and japan one of the most important scholars of the league of nations was sir alfred zimmern like many of the other british enthusiasts for the league such as gilbert murray and florence stawell  the so-called greece and peace set  he came to this from the study of the classics the creation of the league of nations and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues expressed for example by the union for democratic control during world war i also saw the creation after world war i of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs such as the council on foreign relations in new york and the royal institute of international affairs at chatham house in london at the same time the academic study of international relations started to professionalize with the creation of the first

rhodes scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century and became prominent again in recent years under warden of the rhodes house donald markwell a historian of thought about

middle east program of civil society and peace building international festival of peace poetry monuments the following are monuments to peace theories many different theories of peace exist in the world of peace studies which involves the study of conflict transformation disarmament and cessation of violence the definition of peace can vary with religion culture or subject of study one definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences tolerance persists conflicts are resolved through dialog peoples rights are respected and their voices are heard and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension game theory main article peace war game the peace war game is a game theory approach to peace and conflict studies an iterated game originally played in academic groups and by computer simulation for years to study possible strategies of cooperation and aggression as peace makers became richer over time it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated the only strategy that acquired wealth more rapidly was a genghis khan a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources this led to the development of the provokable nice guy strategy a peace-maker until attacked improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor balance of power theories main article balance of power international relations the classical realist position is that the key to promoting order between states and so of increasing the chances of peace is the maintenance of a balance of power between states  a situation where no state is so dominant that it can lay down the law to the rest exponents of this view have included metternich bismarck hans morgenthau and henry kissinger a related approach  more in the tradition of hugo grotius than thomas hobbes  was articulated by the so-called english school of international relations theory such as martin wight in his book power politics 1946 1978 and hedley bull in the anarchical society 1977 as the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace this was a radical critique of those supporters of the allied and associated powers who justified entry into world war i on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in europe from a german bid for hegemony in the second half of the 20th century and especially during the cold war a particular form of balance of power  mutual nuclear deterrence  emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace and that the nuclear umbrella made it safe for smaller wars e.g the vietnam war and the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia to end the prague spring so making such wars more likely democratic peace theory main article democratic peace theory the democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another peace free trade interdependence and globalization it was a central tenet of classical liberalism for example among english liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century that free trade promoted peace for example the cambridge economist john maynard keynes 1883-1946 said that he was brought up on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s during the economic globalization in the decades leading up to world war i writers such as norman angell argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely he made this argument in 1914 these ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century these ideas have seen capitalism as consistent with even conducive to peace peace socialism capitalism and managed capitalism socialist communist and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries e.g lenin j.a hobson john strachey argued that capitalism caused war e.g through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict this led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace however in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war the economist john maynard keynes 1883-1946 argued that managed capitalism could promote peace this involved international coordination of fiscalmonetary policies an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other and a high degree of freedom of trade these ideas underlay keyness work during world war ii that led to the creation of the international monetary fund and the world bank at bretton woods in 1944 and later of the general agreement on tariffs and trade subsequently the world trade organization theory of active peace borrowing from the teachings of norwegian theorist johan galtung one of the pioneers of the field of peace research on positive peace and on the writings of maine quaker gray cox a consortium of theorists activists and practitioners in the experimental john woolman college initiative have arrived at a theory of active peace this theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad which also includes justice and wholeness or well-being an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early hebrew word shalom furthermore the consortium have integrated galtungs teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking peacekeeping and peacebuilding to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure vermont quaker john v wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals communities and societies whereby one transcends first the surface awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues emerging successively into acquiescence pacifism passive resistance active resistance and finally into active peace dedicating themselves to peacemaking peacekeeping andor peace building peace international organization and international law one of the most influential theories of peace especially since woodrow wilson led the creation of the league of nations at the paris peace conference of 1919 is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of international law promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the league of nations the united nations and other functional international organizations one of the most important early exponents of this view was sir alfred zimmern for example in his 1936 book the league of nations and the rule of law trans-national solidarity many idealist thinkers about international relations  e.g in the traditions of kant and karl marx  have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples or classes of people spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war one version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students  an idea most powerfully advanced by cecil rhodes in the creation of the rhodes scholarships and his successors such as j william fulbright another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources many peaces following wolfgang dietrich wolfgang sützl and the innsbruck school of peace studies some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace rather they promote the idea of many peaces they argue that since no singular correct definition of peace can exist peace should be perceived as a plurality this post-modern understanding of peaces was based on the philosophy of jean francois lyotard it served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peaces and elicitive conflict transformation trans-rational peaces in 2008 wolfgang dietrich enlarged his earlier approach of the many peaces to the so-called five families of peace interpretations the energetic moral modern post-modern and trans-rational approach trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations the systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation the so-called elicitive approach peace and conflict studies main article peace and conflict studies peace and conflict studies is an academic field
