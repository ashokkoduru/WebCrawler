gasoline additives increase gasolines octane rating or act as corrosion inhibitors or lubricants thus allowing the use of higher compression ratios for greater efficiency and power types of additives include metal deactivators corrosion inhibitors oxygenates and antioxidants some additives are harmful and are regulated or banned in some countries additives oxygenates alcohols methanol meoh ethanol etoh isopropyl alcohol ipa n-butanol buoh gasoline grade t-butanol gtba ethers methyl tert-butyl ether mtbe now outlawed in many states of the u.s for road use mostly because of water contamination tertiary amyl methyl ether tame tertiary hexyl methyl ether theme ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe tertiary amyl ethyl ether taee diisopropyl ether dipe antioxidants stabilizers butylated hydroxytoluene bht 2,4-dimethyl-6-tert-butylphenol 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol 2,6-dtbp p-phenylenediamine ethylenediamine antiknock agents tetraethyllead now banned almost everywhere for causing brain damage methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl mmt is an extremely poisonous neurotoxic substance and is fatal if swallowedinhaled and will cause a disease similar to parkinsons called manganism ferrocene highly toxic toluene isooctane triptane lead scavengers for leaded gasoline tricresyl phosphate tcp also an aw additive and ep additive 1,2-dibromoethane 1,2-dichloroethane fuel dyes most common solvent red 24 solvent red 26 solvent yellow 124 solvent blue 35 fuel additives in general ether and other flammable hydrocarbons have been used extensively as starting fluid for many difficult-to-start engines especially diesel engines nitromethane or nitro is a high-performance racing fuel acetone is a vaporization additive mainly used with methanol racing fuel to improve vaporisation at start up butyl rubber as polyisobutylene succinimide detergent to prevent fouling of diesel fuel injectors picrate improves combustion increases fuel mileage racing formulations nitromethane can increase the cetane number of diesel fuel improving its combustion properties nitrous oxide or simply nitrous is an oxidizer used in auto racing legislation united states fuel additives in the united states are regulated under section 211 of the clean air act as amended in january 1995 the environmental protection agency epa requires the registration of all fuel additives which are commercially distributed for use in highway motor vehicles in the united states and may require testing and ban harmful additives the epa also regularly reviews the health and net economic benefits of clean air act policies the act also requires deposit control additives dcas be added to all gasolines this type of additive is a detergent additive that acts as a cleansing agent in small passages in the carburetor or fuel injectors this in turn serves to ensure a consistent air and fuel mixture that will contribute to better gas mileage see also for additive metering see metering pumps biobor microbicide oil additive which describes some similar additives top tier detergent gasoline arrc auto repair reference center point 5 technologies accessed via ebscohost on november 27 2009
