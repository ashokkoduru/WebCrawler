gross domestic product gdp is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period quarterly or yearly nominal gdp estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region and to make international comparisons nominal gdp per capita does not however reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries therefore using a gdp ppp per capita basis is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations definition the oecd defines gdp as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs.” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the relative contribution of each industry or sector of the economy.cite error a ref tag is missing the closing ref see the help page charles davenant developed the method further in 1695 the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in 1934 in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in 1944 gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in 1991 trailing behind most other nations determining gross domestic product gdp gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approach this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption i.e the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventories the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities i.e industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approach the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from non-farm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as expenditure approach the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditure gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but does not include the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids double-counting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the u.s bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below.g d p gdp vs gni gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni non-identical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by american-owned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in 1991 the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table 1.7.5 of the national income and product accounts international standards the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts 1993 which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic co-operation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna93 to distinguish it from the previous edition published in 1968 called sna68 sna93 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions national measurement within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdp the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – i.e for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in 1990 was 100 million and its gdp in 2000 was 300 million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in 2000 to its gdp in 1990 we could multiply the gdp in 2000 by one-half to make it relative to 1990 as a base year the result would be that the gdp in 2000 equals 300 million × one-half 150 million in 1990 monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased 50 percent over that period not 200 percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constant-gdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before per-capita gdp is a measure to account for population growth cross-border comparison and purchasing power parity the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically non-tradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassa-samuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if 10 of gdp is being spent on buying hi-tech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to non-traded goods and services in the above example if hi-tech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalities gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing inter-country comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp non-market transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production and volunteer or unpaid services non-monetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in 1900 could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequality-based economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and well-being limitations and criticisms simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in 1934 in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in 1962 kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in 2013 pointing out that gdp focusses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment in 1989 leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly and theologian john b cobb developed the index of sustainable economic welfare isew which they proposed as a more valid measure of socio-economic progress by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the country gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over 50 of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about 15 in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly 70 in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about 20 on the low end to nearly 50 on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the non-inclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented in response to these and other limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress alternative approaches have emerged one such alternative is the capability approach which was developed in the 1980s and focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve lists of countries by their gdp lists of countries by gdp list of countries by gdp nominal per capita list of
