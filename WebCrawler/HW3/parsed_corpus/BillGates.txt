dock  there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing at 13 he enrolled in the lakeside school a private preparatory school when he was in the eighth grade the mothers club at the school used proceeds from lakeside schools rummage sale to buy a teletype model 33 asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric ge computer for the schools students gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest he wrote his first computer program on this machine an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly when he reflected back on that moment he said there was just something neat about the machine after the mothers club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers one of these systems was a pdp-10 belonging to computer center corporation ccc which banned four lakeside students – gates paul allen ric weiland and kent evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time at the end of the ban the four students offered to find bugs in cccs software in exchange for computer time rather than use the system via teletype gates went to cccs offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system including programs in fortran lisp and machine language the arrangement with ccc continued until 1970 when the company went out of business the following year information sciences inc hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol providing them computer time and royalties after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities gates wrote the schools computer program to schedule students in classes he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with a disproportionate number of interesting girls he later stated that it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success at age 17 gates formed a venture with allen called traf-o-data to make traffic counters based on the intel 8008 processor in early 1973 bill gates served as a congressional page in the u.s house of representatives gates graduated from lakeside school in 1973 and was a national merit scholar he scored 1590 out of 1600 on the sat and enrolled at harvard college in the autumn of 1973 chose pre-law major but took most rigorous mathematics and graduate level computer science courses while at harvard he met steve ballmer who would later succeed gates as ceo of microsoft in his second year gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by harry lewis one of his professors gates solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years its successor is faster by only one percent his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at harvard and spent a lot of time using the schools computers gates remained in contact with paul allen and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of 1974 the following year saw the release of the mits altair 8800 based on the intel 8080 cpu and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company gates dropped out of harvard at this time he had talked this decision over with his parents who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start a company microsoft main articles history of microsoft and microsoft basic after reading the january 1975 issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair 8800 gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems mits the creators of the new microcomputer to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform in reality gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it they merely wanted to gauge mitss interest mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november 1975 they named their partnership micro-soft and had their first office located in albuquerque within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november 26 1976 the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february 1976 gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain high-quality software this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late 1976 and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january 1 1979 during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july 1980 regarding its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc the computer company first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using 86-dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of 86-dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a one-time fee of 50,000 gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system they did and the sales of ms-dos made microsoft a major player in the industry despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june 25 1981 which re-incorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november 20 1985 and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os2 although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate management style from microsofts founding in 1975 until 2006 gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he aggressively broadened the companys range of products and wherever microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it he gained a reputation for being distant to others as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor as an executive gates met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys long-term interests at risk he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his role most of its history was primarily as management and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs-80 model 100 but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the companys products he remained interested in technical details jerry pournelle wrote in 1985 that when watching gates announcing microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack on june 15 2006 gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy he divided his responsibilities between two successors placing ray ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and craig mundie in charge of long-term product strategy antitrust litigation further information united states microsoft antitrust case and european union microsoft competition case many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over microsofts business practices have had gates approval in the 1998 united states v microsoft case gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as compete concerned and we the judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i dont recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chiefs denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that gates both sent and received gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying and blocking competition both in violation of the sherman antitrust act appearance in ads gates appeared in a series of ads to promote microsoft in 2008 the first commercial co-starring jerry seinfeld is a 90-second talk between strangers as seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store shoe circus in a mall and notices gates buying shoes inside the salesman is trying to sell mr gates shoes that are a size too big as gates is buying the shoes he holds up his discount card which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in new mexico in 1977 for a traffic violation as they are walking out of the mall seinfeld asks gates if he has melded his mind to other developers after getting a yes he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible again getting a yes some say that this is an homage to seinfelds own show about nothing seinfeld in a second commercial in the series gates and seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people post-microsoft since leaving day-to-day operations at microsoft gates

religion i think are super important weve raised our kids in a religious way theyve gone to the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in ive been very lucky and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world and thats kind of a religious belief i mean its at least a moral belief in the same interview gates said i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing and theres no scientific explanation of how it came about to say that it was generated by random numbers that does seem you know sort of an uncharitable view laughs i think it makes sense to believe in god but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it i dont
