sallows and osiers form the genus salix around 400 species of deciduous trees and shrubs found primarily on moist soils in cold and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere most species are known as willow but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow from old english sealh related to the latin word salix willow some willows particularly arctic and alpine species are low-growing or creeping shrubs for example the dwarf willow salix herbacea rarely exceeds 6 cm 2.4 in in height though it spreads widely across the ground description willows all have abundant watery bark sap which is heavily charged with salicylic acid soft usually pliant tough wood slender branches and large fibrous often stoloniferous roots the roots are remarkable for their toughness size and tenacity to life and roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant the leaves are typically elongated but may also be round to oval frequently with serrated edges most species are deciduous semievergreen willows with coriaceous leaves are rare e.g salix micans and s australior in the eastern mediterranean all the buds are lateral no absolutely terminal bud is ever formed the buds are covered by a single scale usually the bud scale is fused into a cap-like shape but in some species it wraps around and the edges overlap the leaves are simple feather-veined and typically linear-lanceolate usually they are serrate rounded at base acute or acuminate the leaf petioles are short the stipules often very conspicuous resembling tiny round leaves and sometimes remaining for half the summer on some species however they are small inconspicuous and caducous soon falling in color the leaves show a great variety of greens ranging from yellowish to bluish flowers willows are dioecious with male and female flowers appearing as catkins on separate plants the catkins are produced early in the spring often before the leaves the staminate male flowers are without either calyx or corolla they consist simply of stamens varying in number from two to 10 accompanied by a nectariferous gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is itself borne on the rachis of a drooping raceme called a catkin or ament this scale is square entire and very hairy the anthers are rose-colored in the bud but orange or purple after the flower opens they are two-celled and the cells open longitudinally the filaments are threadlike usually pale brown and often bald the pistillate female flowers are also without calyx or corolla and consist of a single ovary accompanied by a small flat nectar gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is likewise borne on the rachis of a catkin the ovary is one-celled the style two-lobed and the ovules numerous cultivation almost all willows take root very readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground the few exceptions include the goat willow salix caprea and peachleaf willow salix amygdaloides one famous example of such growth from cuttings involves the poet alexander pope who begged a twig from a parcel tied with twigs sent from spain to lady suffolk this twig was planted and thrived and legend has it that all of englands weeping willows are descended from this first one willows are often planted on the borders of streams so their interlacing roots may protect the bank against the action of the water frequently the roots are much larger than the stem which grows from them hybrids willows are very cross-compatible and numerous hybrids occur both naturally and in cultivation a well-known ornamental example is the weeping willow salix × sepulcralis which is a hybrid of peking willow salix babylonica from china and white willow salix alba from europe the hybrid cultivar boydii has gained the royal horticultural societys award of garden merit ecological issues willows are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidoptera species such as the mourning cloak butterfly ants such as wood ants are common on willows inhabited by aphids coming to collect aphid honeydew as sometimes do wasps a small number of willow species were widely planted in australia notably as erosion-control measures along watercourses they are now regarded as invasive weeds and many catchment management authorities are removing and replacing them with native trees willow roots spread widely and are very aggressive in seeking out moisture for this reason they can become problematic when planted in residential areas where the roots are notorious for clogging french drains drainage systems weeping tiles septic systems storm drains and sewer systems particularly older tile concrete or ceramic pipes newer pvc sewer pipes are much less leaky at the joints and are therefore less susceptible to problems from willow roots the same is true of water supply piping pests and diseases willow species are hosts to more than a hundred aphid species belonging to chaitophorus and other genera forming large colonies to feed on plant juices on the underside of leaves in particular corythucha elegans the willow lace bug is a bug species in the family tingidae found on willows in north america rust caused by fungi of genus melampsora is known to damage leaves of willows covering them with orange spots uses medicine the leaves and bark of the willow tree have been mentioned in ancient texts from assyria sumer and egypt as a remedy for aches and fever and in ancient greece the physician hippocrates wrote about its medicinal properties in the fifth century bc native americans across the americas relied on it as a staple of their medical treatments it provides temporary pain relief salicin is metabolized into salicylic acid in the human body and is a precursor of aspirin in 1763 its medicinal properties were observed by the reverend edward stone in england he notified the royal society which published his findings the active extract of the bark called salicin was isolated to its crystalline form in 1828 by henri leroux a french pharmacist and raffaele piria an italian chemist who then succeeded in separating out the compound in its pure state in 1897 felix hoffmann created a synthetically altered version of salicin in his case derived from the spiraea plant which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid the new drug formally acetylsalicylic acid was named aspirin by hoffmanns employer bayer ag this gave rise to the hugely important class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids willow has been listed as one of the 38

in the manufacture of double basses for backs sides and linings and in making splines and blocks for bass repair other agriculture willows produce a modest amount of nectar from which bees can make honey and are especially valued as a source of early pollen for bees poor people at one time often ate willow catkins that had been cooked to form a mash art willow is used to make charcoal for drawing and in living sculptures living sculptures are created from live willow rods planted in the ground and woven into shapes such as domes and tunnels willow stems are used to weave baskets and three-dimensional sculptures such as animals and figures willow stems are also used to create garden features such as decorative panels and obelisks energy willow is grown for biomass or biofuel in energy forestry systems as a consequence of its high energy in-energy out ratio large carbon mitigation potential and fast growth large-scale projects to support willow as an energy crop are already at commercial scale in sweden programs in other countries are being developed through initiatives such as the willow biomass project in the us and the energy coppice project in the uk willow may also
