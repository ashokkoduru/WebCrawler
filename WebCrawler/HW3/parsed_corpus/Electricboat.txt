this article is about electrically powered boats in general for the company called electric boat see general dynamics electric boat while a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines with sail power and gasoline engines also remaining popular boats powered by electricity have been used for over 120 years electric boats were very popular from the 1880s until the 1920s when the internal combustion engine took dominance since the energy crises of the 1970s interest in this quiet and potentially renewable marine energy source has been increasing steadily again especially as solar cells became available for the first time making possible motorboats with an infinite range like sailboats the first practical solar boat was probably constructed in 1975 in england history early an early electric boat was developed by the german inventor moritz von jacobi in 1839 in st petersburg russia it was a 24-foot 7.3 m boat which carried 14 passengers at 3 mph it was successfully demonstrated to emperor nicholas i of russia on the neva river golden age it took more than 30 years of battery and motor development before the electric boat became a practical proposition this method of propulsion enjoyed something of a golden age from about 1880 to 1920 when gasoline-powered outboard motors became the dominant method gustave trouvé french electrical engineer patented a small electric motor in 1880 he initially suggested that the motor could power a set of paddle wheels to propel boats on the water and later argued for the use of a propeller instead an austrian emigre to britain anthony reckenzaun was instrumental in the development of the first practical electric boats while working as an engineer for the electrical power storage company he undertook much original and pioneering work on various forms of electric traction in 1882 he designed the first significant electric launch driven by storage batteries and named the boat electricity the boat had a steel hull and was over 7 metres long the batteries and electric equipment were concealed from view underneath the seating area increasing the passenger accommodation the boats were used for leisure excursions up and down the river thames and provided a very smooth clean and quiet trip the boat could run for six hours and operate at an average speed of 8 miles per hour moritz immisch established his company in 1882 in partnership with william keppel 7th earl of albemarle specializing in the application of electric motors to transportation the company employed magnus volk as a manager in the development of their electric launch department after 12 months of experimental work starting in 1888 with a randan skiff the firm commissioned the construction of hulls which they equipped with electrical apparatus the worlds first fleet of electric launches for hire with a chain of electrical charging stations was established along the river thames in the 1880s an 1893 pleasure map of the thames shows 8 charging stations for electric launches between kew strand-on-the-green and reading caversham the company built its headquarters on the island called platts eyot from 1889 until just before the first world war the boating season and regattas saw the silent electric boats plying their way up and downstream the companys electric launches were widely used by the rich as a conveyance along the river grand ships were constructed of teak or mahogany and furnished luxuriously with stained glass windows silk curtains and velvet cushions william sargeant was commissioned by immischs company to build the mary gordon in 1898 for leeds city council for use on the roundhay park lake  the boat still survives and is currently being restored this 70 foot long luxury pleasure craft could carry up to 75 passengers in comfort launches were exported elsewhere  they were used in the lake district and all over the world in the 1893 chicago world fair 55 launches developed from anthony reckenzauns work carried more than a million passengers electric boats had an early period of popularity between around 1890 and 1920 before the emergence of the internal combustion engine drove them out of most applications most of the electric boats of this era were small passenger boats on non-tidal waters at a time when the only power alternative was steam decline with the advent of the gasoline-powered outboard motor the use of electric power on boats declined from the 1920s however in a few situations the use of electric boats has persisted from the early 20th century to the present day one of these is on the königssee lake near berchtesgaden in south-eastern germany here the lake is considered so environmentally sensitive that steam and motor boats have been prohibited since 1909 instead the bayerische seenschifffahrt company and its predecessors have operated a fleet of electric launches to provide a public passenger service on the lake the first electrically powered submarines were built in the 1890s such as the spanish peral submarine launched in 1888 since then electric power has been used almost exclusively for the powering of submarines underwater traditionally by batteries although diesel was used for directly powering the propeller while on the surface until the development of diesel-electric transmission by the us navy in 1928 in which the propeller was always powered by an electric motor energy coming from batteries while submerged or diesel generator while surfaced the use of combined fuel and electric propulsion combined diesel-electric or gas or codlog has gradually been extended over the years to the extent that some modern liners such as the queen mary 2 use only electric motors for the actual propulsion powered by diesel and gas turbine engines the advantages include being able to run the fuel engines at an optimal speed at all times and being able to mount the electric motor in a pod which may be rotated by 360° for increased manoeuvrability note that this is not actually an electric boat but rather a variant of diesel-electric or turbine-electric propulsion similar to the diesel or electric propulsion used on submarines since wwi renaissance the use of electricity alone to power boats stagnated apart from their outboard use as trolling motors until the duffy electric boat company of california started mass-producing small electric craft in 1968 duffy boats has produced over 10,000 electric powered boats to date and is producing well over 300 per year today it wasnt until the 1980s that the electric boat association was formed and solar powered boats started to emerge components the main components of the drive system of any electrically powered boat are similar in all cases and similar to the options available for any electric vehicle charger electric energy has to be obtained for the battery bank from some source a mains charger allows the boat to be charged from shore-side power when available shore-based power stations are subject to much stricter environmental controls than the average marine diesel or outboard motor by purchasing green electricity it is possible to operate electric boats using sustainable or renewable energy solar panels can be built into the boat in reasonable areas in the deck cabin roof or as awnings some solar panels or photovoltaic arrays can be flexible enough to fit to slightly curved surfaces and can be ordered in unusual shapes and sizes nonetheless the heavier rigid mono-crystalline types are more efficient in terms of energy output per square meter the efficiency of solar panels rapidly decreases when they are not pointed directly at the sun so some way of tilting the arrays while under way is very advantageous towed generators are common on long-distance cruising yachts and can generate a lot of power when travelling under sail if an electric boat has sails as well and will be used in deep water deeper than about 15 m or 50 ft then a towed generator can help build up battery charge while sailing there is no point in trailing such a generator while under electric propulsion as the extra drag from the generator would waste more electricity than it generates some electric power systems use the free-wheeling drive propeller to generate charge through the drive motor when sailing but this system including the design of the propeller and any gearing cannot be optimised for both functions it may be better locked off or feathered while the towed generators more efficient turbine gathers energy wind turbines are common on cruising yachts and can be very well suited to electric boats there are safety considerations regarding the spinning blades especially in a strong wind it is important that the boat is big enough that the turbine can be mounted out of the way of all passengers and crew under all circumstances including when alongside and when coming alongside a dock a bank or a pier it is also important that the boat is big enough and stable enough that the top hamper created by the turbine on its pole or mast does not compromise its stability in a strong wind or gale large enough wind generators could produce a completely wind-powered electric boat no such boats are yet known although a few mechanical wind turbine powered boats exist in hybrid electric boats it boat has an internal combustion engine anyway then its alternator will provide significant charge when it is running two schemes are in use the combustion engine and the electric motor are both coupled to the drive parallel hybrid or the combustion engine drives a separate generator only for charging the storage batteries series hybrid in all cases a charge regulator is needed this ensures that the batteries are charged at the maximum rate that they safely can stand when the power is available it also ensures that they are not overcharged when nearing full charge and not overheated when a large charge current becomes available battery bank there have been significant technical advances in battery technology in recent years and more are to be expected in the future lead-acid batteries may still be the most viable option at the moment 2008 deep-cycle traction batteries are the obvious choice they are heavy and bulky but not much more so than the diesel engine tanks and fittings that they may replace they need to be securely mounted low down and centrally situated in the boat it is essential that they cannot move around under any circumstances care must be taken that there is no risk of the strong acid being spilled in the event of a capsize as this could be very dangerous venting of explosive hydrogen and oxygen gases is also necessary typical lead-acid batteries must be kept topped-up with distilled water valve-regulated lead-acid vrla batteries usually known as sealed lead-acid gel or agm batteries minimize the risk of spillage and gases are only vented when the batteries are overcharged these batteries require minimal maintenance as they cannot and usually do not need to be refilled with water nickel metal hydride lithium-ion and other battery types are becoming available but are still expensive these are the kind of batteries currently common in rechargeable hand tools like drills and screwdrivers but they are relatively new to this environment they require different charge controllers to those that suit lead-acid types lithium-ion in this case usually means lithium iron phosphate batteries which although are heavier than other lithium-ion is safer for marine application they are expensive but in applications which need reliability and ruggedness like ferries which run most of the day 10–12 hoursday this is the best option it has a much longer life  5 to 7 years life-cycle fuel cells or flow batteries may provide significant advantages in years to come today 2010 however they are still expensive and require specialist equipment and knowledge the size of the battery bank determines the range of the boat under electric power the speed at which the boat is motored also affects range – a lower speed can make a big difference to the energy required to move a hull other factors that affect range include sea-state currents windage and any charge that can be reclaimed while under way for example by solar panels in full sun a wind turbine in a good wind will help and motor-sailing in any wind could do so even more speed controller to make the boat usable and maneuverable a simple-to-operate forwardstopbackwards speed controller is needed this must be efficient—i.e it must not get hot and waste energy at any speed—and it must be able to stand the full current that could conceivably flow under any full-load condition one of the most common types of speed controllers uses pulse-width modulation pwm pwm controllers send high frequency pulses of power to the motors as more power is needed the pulses become longer in duration electric motor a wide variety of electric motor technologies are in use traditional field-wound dc motors were and still are used today many boats use lightweight permanent magnet dc motors the advantage of both types is that while the speed can be controlled electronically this is not a requirement some boats use ac motors or permanent magnet brushless motors the advantages of these are the lack of commutators which can wear out or fail and the often lower currents allowing thinner cables the disadvantages are the total reliance on the required electronic controllers and the usually high voltages which require a high standard of insulation drive train traditional boats use an inboard motor powering a propeller through a propeller shaft complete with bearings and seals often a gear reduction is incorporated in order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller this can be a traditional gear box coaxial planetary gears or a transmission with belts or chains because of the inevitable loss associated with gearing many drives eliminate it by using slow high-torque motors the electric motor can be encapsulated into a pod with the propeller and fixed outside the hull saildrive or on an outboard fixture outboard motor types there are as many types of electric boat as there are boats with any other method of propulsion but some types are significant for various reasons historical and restored electric boats exist and are often important projects for those involved see the mary gordon electric boat for example canal river and lake boats electric boats with their limited range and performance have tended to be used mostly on inland waterways where their complete lack of local pollution is a significant advantage electric drives are also available as auxiliary propulsion for sailing yachts on inland waters electric outboards and trolling motors have been available for some years at prices from about 100 us up to several thousand these require external batteries in the bottom of the boat but are otherwise practical one-piece items most available electric outboards are not as efficient as custom drives but are optimised for their intended use e.g for inland waterway fishermen they are quiet and they do not pollute the water or the air so they do not scare away or harm fish birds and other wildlife combined with modern waterproof battery packs electric outboards are also ideal for yacht tenders and other inshore pleasure boats cruising yachts usually have an auxiliary engine and there are two main uses for it one is to power ahead or motor-sail at sea when the wind is light or from the wrong direction the other is to provide the last 10 minutes or so of propulsion when the boat is in port and needs to be manoeuvred into a tight berth in a crowded and confined marina or harbour electric propulsion is not suitable for prolonged cruising at full power although the power required to motor slowly in light airs and calm seas is small regarding the second case electric drives are ideally suited as they can be finely controlled and can provide substantial power for short periods of time commercial ferries norways first battery-electric ferry is the ampere based on operational data siemens concludes in a life cycle analysis that 61 of norways 112 diesel ferry routes could be replaced by electric ferries with a payback time of 5 years the analysis includes auxiliary costs such as chargers grid and so on other projects are considered in canada sweden and denmark indias first solar ferry a 75-passenger boat that is powered by sun and grid charging with lithium batteries is under construction and expected to be in operation by july 2016 based on the predictions of consumption the payback time is 3 years diesel-electric hybrid there is a third potential use for a diesel auxiliary and that is to charge the batteries when they suddenly start to wane far from shore in the middle of the night or at anchor after some days of living aboard in this case where this kind of use is to be expected perhaps on a larger cruising yacht then a combined diesel-electric solution may be designed from the start the diesel engine is installed with the prime purpose of charging the battery banks and the electric motor with that of propulsion there is some reduction in efficiency if motoring for long distances as the diesels power is converted first to electricity and then to motion but there is a balancing saving every time the wind sail and solar-charged batteries are used for manoeuvring and for short journeys without starting the diesel there is the flexibility of being able to start the diesel as a pure generator whenever required the main losses are in weight and installation cost but on the bigger cruising boats that may sit at anchor running large diesels for hours every day these are not too big an issue compared to the savings that can be made at other times an example is the fishing boat selfa el-max 1099 with 135 kwh battery and 80kw diesel generator an lng-powered supply vessel started operation in 2016 with a 653 kwh1600 kw battery acting as spinning reserve during dynamic positioning saving 15-30 fuel solar powered a boat propelled by direct solar energy is a marine solar vehicle the available sunlight is almost always converted to electricity by solar cells temporarily stored in accumulator batteries and used to drive a propeller through an electric motor power levels are usually on the order of a few hundred watts to a few kilowatts solar powered boats started to become known around 1985 and in 1995 the first commercial solar passenger boats appeared solar powered boats have been used successfully at sea the first crossing of the atlantic ocean was achieved in the winter of 20062007 by the solar catamaran sun21 see also list of solar-powered boats wired electric boats a special category of electric boats are the vessels receiving their electrical power by wire one or two wires are fixed over the water and the boat can make contact with them to draw electric current in case of a single wire the electrical circuit has to be closed by the water itself giving rise to a larger resistance and corrosion of the electrodes in case of two wires no electric current has to be sent through the water but the twin wires which cause a short-circuit whenever they come into contact with each other complicate the construction naturally the boat has to stay close to the wire and therefore it is limited in its maneuverability for ferries and on narrow canals this is no problem the straussee ferry in strausberg germany is an example it crosses a lake along a 370 m trajectory it is powered by 170 v from a single overhead wire in the mauvages tunnel fr on the marne-rhine canal a bipolar overhead line provides 600 v dc to an electrical tug pulling itself and several ships through the 4877 m tunnel along a submerged chain this prevents the buildup of diesel exhaust fumes in the tunnel another example was the experimental electrical tug teltow de on the kleinmachnower see 17 km south-west of berlin it was used from 1903 till 1910 and had current collection poles based on those used on trolley buses pollution and embodied energy further information embodied energy all the component parts of any boat have to be manufactured and will eventually have to be disposed of some pollution and use of other energy sources are inevitable during these stages of the boats life and electric boats are no exception the benefits to the global environment that are achieved by the use of electric propulsion are manifested during the working life of the boat which can be many years these benefits are also most directly felt in the sensitive and very beautiful environments in which such a boat is used the may 2010 edition of classic boat magazine carried a pro and con article entitled electric debate jamie campbell argued against electric boating on four main counts which were rebuffed by kevin desmond and ian rutter of the electric boat association jamie campbell asserted that electric propulsion can no more be justified afloat than a seagull outboard motor proposing wooden sailing boats and rowing dinghies as by far the most environmentally sensitive and renewable options for recreational boating the article mentions 25 and 30 discounts being offered to electric boaters by the uk environment agency and the broads authority and that battery powered vehicles have  ⁄5 the carbon footprint of their petrol equivalents it is claimed that a typical recharge after a days cruising costs £1.50 without the use of solar or wind power solar ships in 2010 the tûranor planetsolar a 35 metre long 26 metre wide catamaran yacht powered by 537 square metres of solar panels was unveiled on 4 may 2012 it completed a 60,023 kilometres 37,297 mi circumnavigation of the earth in monaco after 585 days and visiting 28 different countries without using any fossil fuel it is so far the largest solar-powered boat ever built indias first solar ferry a 75-passenger boat fully powered by sun is under construction it is expected to be completed by the middle of 2016 japans biggest shipping line nippon yusen and nippon oil corporation said solar panels capable of generating 40 kilowatts of electricity would be placed on top of a 60,000 tonne car carrier ship to be used by toyota motor corporation the monaco yacht company wally has announced a gigayacht designed for billionaires torn between buying a mansion and a superyacht the why 58 x 38 is designed to have an autonomous cruising range of 12,000 miles at 12 knots by means of 900m of solar panels which generate 150 kw to assist
