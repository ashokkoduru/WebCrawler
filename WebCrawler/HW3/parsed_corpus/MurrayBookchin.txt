movement for a democracy of content a group of 20 or so post-trotskyists who collectively edited the periodical contemporary issues – a magazine for a democracy of content contemporary issues embraced utopianism the periodical provided a forum for the belief that previous attempts to create utopia had foundered on the necessity of toil and drudgery but now modern technology had obviated the need for human toil a liberatory development to achieve this post-scarcity society bookchin developed a theory of ecological decentralism the magazine published bookchins first articles including the pathbreaking the problem of chemicals in food 1952 in 1958 bookchin defined himself as an anarchist seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology his first book our synthetic environment was published under the pseudonym lewis herber in 1962 a few months before rachel carsons silent spring the book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism in 1964 bookchin joined the congress of racial equality core and protested racism at the 1964 worlds fair during 1964-67 while living on manhattans lower east side he cofounded and was the principal figure in the new york federation of anarchists his groundbreaking essay ecology and revolutionary thought introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics in 1968 he founded another group that published the influential anarchos magazine which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy and on decentralization and miniaturization lecturing throughout the united states he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the counterculture his widely republished 1969 essay listen marxist warned students for a democratic society in vain against an impending takeover by a marxist group once again the dead are walking in our midst he wrote ironically draped in the name of marx the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth century so the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody in turn the october revolution of 1917 and the civil war of 1918-1920 with its class line its bolshevik party its proletarian dictatorship its puritanical morality and even its slogan soviet power these and other influential 1960s essays are anthologized in post-scarcity anarchism 1971 in 1969-1970 he taught at alternate u a counter-cultural radical school based on 14th street in manhattan in 1971 he moved to burlington vermont with a group of friends to put into practice his ideas of decentralization in the fall of 1973 he was hired by goddard college to lecture on technology his lectures led to a teaching position and to the creation of the social ecology studies program in 1974 and the institute for social ecology soon thereafter of which he became the director in 1974 he was hired by ramapo college in mahwah new jersey where he quickly became a full professor the ise was a hub for experimentation and study of appropriate technology in the 1970s in 1977-78 he was a member of the spruce mountain affinity group of the clamshell alliance also in 1977 he published the spanish anarchists a history of the spanish anarchist movement up to the revolution of 1936 during this period bookchin forged some ties with the nascent libertarian movement he spoke at a libertarian party convention and contributed to a newsletter edited by karl hess in 1976 he told a libertarian activist that if i were a voting man id vote for macbride — lp nominee roger macbride that is in 1980 he resigned as ise director and upon his retirement from ramapo in early 1983 he moved back to burlington vermont there he continued to write but also put his political ideas into practice by working with groups that opposed a wood chip plant a trash incinerator a condo development on the lake champlain waterfront and a luxury marina to foster face-to-face democracy he helped create burlingtons neighborhood assemblies in 1982 his book the ecology of freedom had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement both in the united states and abroad his lectures in germany influenced some of the founders of the german greens he was a principal figure in the burlington greens in 1986-1990 an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to create neighborhood democracy in from urbanization to cities published in 1987 as the rise of urbanization and the decline of citizenship bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept a few years later the politics of social ecology written by his partner of 20 years janet biehl briefly summarized these ideas in 1987 as the keynote speaker at the first gathering of the u.s greens in amherst massachusetts bookchin initiated a critique of deep ecology indicting it for misanthropy neo-malthusianism biocentricism and irrationalism a high-profile deep ecologist dave foreman of earth first had recently said that famine in ethiopia represented nature taking its course nature self-correcting for human overpopulation in 1995 bookchin lamented the decline of american anarchism into primitivism anti-technologism neo-situationism individual self-expression and ad hoc adventurism at the expense of forming a social movement arthur verslius said bookchin describes himself as a social anarchist because he looks forward to a gentle societal revolution bookchin has lit out after those whom he terms lifestyle anarchists the publication of social anarchism or lifestyle anarchism in 1995 criticizing this tendency was startling to anarchists thereafter bookchin concluded that american anarchism was essentially individualistic and broke with anarchism publicly in 1999 he placed his ideas into a new political ideology communalism spelled with a capital c to differentiate it from other forms of communalism a form of libertarian socialism that retains his ideas about assembly democracy and the necessity of decentralization of settlement powermoneyinfluence agriculture manufacturing etc in addition to his political writings bookchin wrote extensively on philosophy calling his ideas dialectical naturalism the dialectical writings of hegel which articulate a developmental philosophy of change and growth seemed to him to lend themselves to an organic even ecological approach although hegel exercised a considerable influence on bookchin he was not in any sense a hegelian his later philosophical writings emphasize humanism rationality and the ideals of the enlightenment his last major published work was the third revolution a four-volume history of the libertarian movements in european and american revolutions he continued to teach at the ise until 2004 bookchin died of congestive heart failure on july 30 2006 at his home in burlington at the age of 85 thought general sociological and psychological views bookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw was a more complex view of societies in the ecology of freedom the emergence and dissolution of hierarchy he says that my use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative there is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and state careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality to use the words hierarchy class and state interchangeably as many social theorists do is insidious and obscurantist this practice in the name of a classless or libertarian society could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche the objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure heinous as my view may be to modern freudians it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature this repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation this mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day-not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception social ecology main article social ecology in the essay what is social ecology bookchin summarizes the meaning of social ecology as follows social ecology is based on the conviction that nearly all of our present ecological problems originate in deep-seated social problems it follows from this view that these ecological problems cannot be understood let alone solved without a careful understanding of our existing society and the irrationalities that dominate it to make this point more concrete economic ethnic cultural and gender conflicts among many others lie at the core of the most serious ecological dislocations we face today—apart to be sure from those that are produced by natural catastrophes libertarian municipalism main article libertarian municipalism starting in the 1970s bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the municipal level in a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way the overriding problem is to change the structure of society so that people gain power the best arena to do that is the municipality—the city town and village—where we have an opportunity to create a face-to-face democracy in 1980 bookchin used the term libertarian municipalism to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the state with a confederation of free municipalities libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers—the municipal confederations and the nation-state—cannot coexist its supporters—communalists—believe it to be the means to achieve a rational society and its structure becomes the organization of society legacy and influence though bookchin by his own recognition failed to win over a substantial body of supporters during his own lifetime his ideas have nonetheless influenced movements and thinkers across the globe notable among these is the kurdistan workers party pkk an organisation in turkey which has fought the turkish state since the 1980s to try to secure greater political and cultural rights for the countrys kurds though founded on a rigid marxist–leninist ideology the pkk has seen a shift in its thought and aims since the capture and imprisonment of its leader abdullah Öcalan in 1999 Öcalan began reading a variety of post-marxist political theory while in prison and found particular currency in bookchins works Öcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with bookchin through his lawyers describing himself as bookchins student eager to adapt his thought to middle eastern society bookchin was too ill to accept the request in may 2004 bookchin conveyed this message my hope is that the kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish they are fortunate indeed to have a leader of mr Öcalan’s talents to guide them when bookchin died in 2006 the pkk hailed the american thinker as one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century and vowed to put his theory into practice democratic confederalism the variation on communalism developed by Öcalan in his writings and adopted by the pkk does not outwardly seek kurdish rights within the context of the formation of an independent state separate from turkey the pkk claims that this project is not envisioned as being only for kurds but rather for all peoples of the region regardless of their ethnic national or religious background rather it promulgates the formation of assemblies and organisations beginning at the grassroots level to enact its ideals in a non-state framework beginning at the local level it also places a particular emphasis on securing and promoting womens rights the pkk has had some success in implementing its programme through organisations such as the democratic society congress dtk which coordinates political and social activities within turkey and the koma civakên kurdistan kck which does so across all countries where kurds live selected bibliography books our synthetic environment 1962 crisis in our cities 1965 desire and need 1967 post-scarcity anarchism 1971 and 2004 isbn 1-904859-06-2 the limits of the city
