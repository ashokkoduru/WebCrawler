societal collapse is the fall or disintegration of complex human societies societal collapse broadly includes abrupt societal failures such as that of the mayan civilization as well as more extended gradual declines of cultures institutions or a civilization like the fall of the western roman empire the general subject arises in anthropology history sociology politics and other fields and more recently in complex systems science causes of collapse common factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical environmental social and cultural and disruptions in one domain sometimes cascade into others in some cases a natural disaster e.g tsunami earthquake massive fire or climate change may precipitate a collapse other factors such as a malthusian catastrophe overpopulation or resource depletion might be the proximate cause of collapse significant inequity may combine with lack of loyalty to a central power structure and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and taking power from a smaller wealthy elite the diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures foreign invasions the decline of the roman empire is one of the events traditionally marking the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the european middle ages throughout the 5th century the empires territories in western europe and northwestern africa including italy fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the barbarian invasions although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries until the arab expansion this view of the collapse of the roman empire is challenged however by modern historians who see rome as merely transforming from the western empire into barbarian kingdoms as the western emperors delegated themselves out of existence and the east transforming into the byzantine empire which only fell in 1453 ad north africas populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the bedouin tribes of banu sulaym and banu hilal ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal invaders had become completely arid desert in the brutal pillaging that followed mongol invasions the invaders decimated the populations of china russia the middle east and islamic central asia later mongol leaders such as timur though he himself became a muslim destroyed many cities slaughtered thousands of people and did irreparable damage to the ancient irrigation systems of mesopotamia these invasions transformed a civil society to a nomadic one encounters between european explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence smallpox ravaged mexico in the 1520s killing 150,000 in tenochtitlán alone including the emperor and peru in the 1530s aiding the european conquerors some believe that the death of up to 95 of the native american population of the new world was caused by old world diseases live smallpox was also included in the ship inventories of the australian first settlement and a smallpox epidemic spread across the continent 3 years after european settlement societal collapse of many indigenous cultures has occurred as a result of european imperialism in various parts of the globe particularly in areas where european settler communities took possession of land once held by native peoples in latin and north america and in australasia the effects of this dispossession is still evident in many of the problems confronting indigenous cultures including alcoholism high rates of incarceration suicide rates and fraternal violence sub-replacement fertility the greek historian polybius largely blamed the decline of the hellenistic world on low fertility rates writing his work the histories that in a speech to roman nobles the emperor augustus commented on the low birthrates of the roman elite upon the establishment of the roman empire emperor augustus would introduce legislation to increase the birthrates of the roman nobility changes occurring with collapse there are three main types of collapse reversionsimplification a societys adaptive capacity may be reduced by either a rapid change in population or societal complexity destabilizing its institutions and causing massive shifts in population and other social dynamics in cases of collapse civilizations tend to revert to less complex less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology these are characteristics of a dark age examples of such societal collapse are the hittite empire the mycenaean civilization the western roman empire the mauryan and gupta empires in india the mayas the angkor in cambodia and the han and tang dynasties in china incorporationabsorption alternately a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic more complex inter-regional social structure this happened in ancient egypt and mesopotamia the levantine cultures the mughal and delhi sultanates in india sung china the aztec culture in mesoamerica the inca culture in south america and the modern civilizations of china japan and india as well as many modern states in the middle east and africa obliteration everyone in the society dies other changes that may accompany a collapse destratification complex societies stratified on the basis of class gender race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured in many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian despecialization one of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity is a high level of job specialization the most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task indeed the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes during societal collapse the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits decentralization as power becomes decentralized people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms in many instances of collapse there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette geographically speaking communities become more parochial or isolated for example following the collapse of the mayan civilization many maya returned to their traditional hamlets moving away from the large cities that had been the centers of the empire destructuralization institutions processes and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations after collapse evidence of epiphenomena institutions and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles depopulation societal collapse is almost always associated with a population decline in extreme cases the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely such as happened with the greenland vikings or a number of polynesian islands in less extreme cases populations are reduced until a demographic balance is re-established between human societies and the depleted natural environment a classic example is the case of ancient rome which had a population of about 1.5 million during the reign of trajan in the early 2nd century ad but had only 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century population dynamics in the general study of cultural change and population dynamics a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes organizational adaptability relates importantly to organizational diversity several key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics theories the coupled breakdown of economic cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse in his book collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed jared diamond proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other non-sustainable exploitation of resources climate changes diminishing support from friendly societies hostile neighbors and inappropriate attitudes for change joseph tainter theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival it matches closely toynbees idea that they find problems they cant solve linking socialenvironmental dynamics modern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources however many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another—leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause what produces modern sedentary life unlike nomadic hunter-gatherers is extraordinary modern economic productivity tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness both because of a societys dependence on it and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being self limiting as demonstrated in western cultures ideal of perpetual growth as a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources the environments diminishing returns are hidden from view societal complexity is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable and a disorderly reorganization were to follow the scissors model of malthusian collapse where the population grows without limit and resources do not is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other for the modern world economy for example the growing conflict between food and fuel depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources is visible in the recent major commodity price shocks it is one of the key relationships people since the early studies of the club of rome have been most concerned with jared diamond pursues these themes in his 2005 book collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed energy return on energy invested theories a related economic model is proposed by thomas homer-dixon and by charles hall in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction or energy return on energy invested eroei this measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy there would be no surplus if eroei approaches 11 what hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that estimated to be 31 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society part of the mental equation is that the eroei of our generally preferred energy source petroleum has fallen in the past century from 1001 to the range of 101 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves an eroei of more than ~3 then is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks such as maintaining government legal and financial institutions a transportation infrastructure manufacturing building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on the eroei figure also affects the number of people needed for sustainable food production in the pre-modern world it was often the case that 80 of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100 with a low energy budget in modern times the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high eroei enabled 100 of the population to be fed with only 4 of the population employed in agriculture diminishing eroei making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy and so increases the number of people employed in food production again models of societal response according to joseph tainter 1990 too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse the dinosaur a large-scale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate and yet nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources reduced availability in this type of society rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action they will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans projects and social institutions the runaway train a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth cf frederick jackson turners frontier thesis this type of society based almost exclusively on acquisition e.g pillage or exploitation cannot be sustained indefinitely the assyrian and mongol empires for example both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests were forthcoming the house of cards a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse this type of society has been seen with particular frequency among eastern bloc and other communist nations in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party such that the government must either stifle association wholesale encouraging dissent and subversion or exercise less authority than it asserts undermining its legitimacy in the public eye tainters critique tainter argues that these models though superficially useful cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other for example the failure of easter islands leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above the islanders who erected large statues called moai as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors used felled trees as rollers to transport them because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify moai production because easter islands geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate house of cards deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties an additional runaway train iteration together these events led to the collapse of the civilization but no single factor above provides an adequate account mainstream interpretations of the history of easter island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors see easter island historydestruction of society and population again no single point explains the collapse only a complex and integrated view can do so tainters position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support he asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms in his own words p. 194 human societies are problem-solving organizations sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita and investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns with these facts in mind collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity stratification internal and external communication and exchange and productivity toynbee’s theory of decay the british historian arnold j toynbee in his 12-volume magnum opus a study of history 1961 theorized that all civilizations pass through several distinct stages genesis growth time of troubles universal state and disintegration carroll quigley would expand on and refine this theory in his the evolution of civilizations toynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment over the human environment or attacks from outside rather societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones the fixation on the old methods of the creative minority leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a dominant minority that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience failing to recognize new ways of thinking he argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their former self by which they become prideful and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face he argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a universal state which stifles political creativity he states first the dominant minority attempts to hold by force  against all right and reason  a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit and then the proletariat repays injustice with resentment fear with hate and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation  and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration the dominant minority creates a universal state the internal proletariat a universal church and the external proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands he argues that as civilizations decay they form an internal proletariat and an external proletariat the internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization and grows bitter the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos and grows envious he argues that as civilizations decay there is a schism in the body social whereby abandon and self-control together replace creativity and truancy and martyrdom together replace discipleship by the creative minority he argues that in this environment people resort to archaism idealization of the past futurism idealization of the future detachment removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world and transcendence meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight as a prophet he argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new church with new and stronger spiritual insights around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died toynbees use of the word church refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship or the same unity found in some kind of social order the great irony expressed by these and others like them is that civilizations that seem ideally designed to creatively solve problems find themselves doing so self-destructively systems science researchers as yet have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies which is an important scientific problem genuine structural collapse seems in many cases the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist however until they can be concretely identified scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives using systems thinking for careful storytelling about systemic organization and change history includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation the abrupt dissolution of the soviet union in the course of a few months without any external attack according to johan galtung was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems although a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a cultures social and economic life societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture russian culture would seem to have outlived both the society of imperial russia and the society of the soviet union for example frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a classic period of centralized social order perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites for example the black plague contributed to breaking the hold of european feudal society on its underclass in the 15th century examples of civilizations and societies
