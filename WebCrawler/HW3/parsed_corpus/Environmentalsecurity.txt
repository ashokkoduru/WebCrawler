environmental events and trends to individuals communities or nations it may focus on the impact of human conflict and international relations on the environment or on how environmental problems cross state borders general the millennium project assessed definitions of environmental security and created a synthesis definition environmental security is environmental viability for life support with three sub-elements preventing or repairing military damage to the environment preventing or responding to environmentally caused conflicts and protecting the environment due to its inherent moral value it considers the abilities of individuals communities or nations to cope with environmental risks changes or conflicts or limited natural resources for example climate change can be viewed a threat to environmental security human activity impacts co2 emissions impacting regional and global climatic and environmental changes and thus changes in agricultural output this can lead to food shortages which will then cause political debate ethnic tension and civil unrest environmental security is an important concept in two fields international relations and international development within international development projects may aim to improve aspects of environmental security such as food security or water security but also connected aspects such as energy security that are now recognised as sustainable development goals at un level targets for mdg 7 about environmental sustainability show international priorities for environmental security target 7b is about the security of fisheries on which many people depend for food fisheries are an example of a resource that cannot be contained within state borders a conflict before the international court of justice between chile and peru about maritime borders and their associated fisheries is a case study for environmental security history the copenhagen school defines the referent object of environmental security as the environment or some strategic part of it historically the definition of international security has varied over time after world war ii definitions typically focused on the subject of realpolitik that developed during the cold war between the united states and the soviet union as tensions between the superpowers eased after the collapse of the soviet union academic discussions of definitions of security significantly expanded to encompass a far broader range of threats to peace including particularly environmental threats associated with the political implications of resource use or pollution by the mid-1980s this field of study was becoming known as environmental security despite a wide range of semantic and academic debates over terms it is now widely acknowledged that environmental factors play both direct and indirect roles in both political disputes and violent conflicts in the academic sphere environmental security is defined as the relationship between security concerns such as armed conflict and the natural environment a small but rapidly developing field it has become particularly relevant for those studying resource scarcity and conflict in the developing world prominent early researchers in the field include felix dodds norman myers jessica tuchman mathews michael renner richard ullman arthur westing michael klare thomas homer dixon geoffrey dabelko peter gleick and joseph romm origins of environmental security according to jon barnett environmental security emerged as an important concept in security studies because of some interrelated developments which started in 1960s the first one was the increasing level of environmental consciousness in so called developed countries various occurrences and events triggered the growth of the environmental movement during this period of time rachel carsons well-known book silent spring was one of the extraordinary publication of that time and brought greater degree of environmental awareness among ordinary people by warning the dangers to all natural systems including animals and food chain from the misuse of chemical pesticides such as ddt thus carson was not arguably one of the social revolutionary at that time who urged the public awareness of environmental issues moreover the number of largest well-known environmental non-governmental organizations such as the world wildlife fund 1961 friends of the earth 1969 and greenpeace 1971 were founded during that time the second notable development which brings the emergence of concept of environmental security was number of scholars started to criticize the traditional notion of security and mainstream security debates in their work from 1970s by emphasizing its inability to handle environmental problems at national and international security level first commentators were richard falk who published‘this endangered planet 1971 and harold and margaret sprout who wrote‘toward a politics of planet earth1971 these two commentators asserted in their book that the notion of security can no longer be centered only on military power rather nations should collectively take measurements against common environmental problems since they pose threat to national well-being and thus international stability these main ideas about environmental interdependence between countries and common security threat have remained key themes of environmental security studies however not until richard ullman publishes an academic article named “redefining security” 1983 radical departure from the dominant security discourse haven’t happened ullman offered the following definition of national security threat as an action or sequence of events that 1 threatens drastically and over a relatively brief span of time to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants of a state or 2 threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices available to the government of a state or to private nongovernmental entities within the state significant other scientists onward also linked the issue of security by focusing on the role of environmental degradation in causing violent conflict environmental change and national security even though environmental degradation and climate change sometimes cause war and violent conflict within and between countries and other times not it can weaken the national security of the state in number of profound ways environmental change can undermine the economic prosperity which plays big role in country’s military capacity and material power in some developed countries and in most developing countries natural resources and environmental services tend to be important factors for economic growth and employment rate income from and employment in primary sectors such as agriculture forestry fishing and mining and from environmentally dependent services like torus may all be adversely affected by environmental change if natural capital base of an economy erodes then so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces moreover changes in environmental condition can exposes people to health threats it can also undermine human capital and its well-being which are essential factors of economic development and stability of human society climate change also could through extreme weather events have a more direct impact on national security by damaging critical infrastructures such as military bases naval yards and training grounds thereby severely threatening essential national defense resources selected early literature brown l 1977 redefining security,”
