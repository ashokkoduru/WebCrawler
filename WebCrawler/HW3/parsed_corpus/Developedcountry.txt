country first world country and post-industrial country the term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous as industrialization is an ongoing process that is hard to define the first industrialized country was the united kingdom followed by belgium later it spread further to germany united states france and other western european countries according to some economists such as jeffrey sachs however the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century definition and criteria economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions one such criterion is income per capita countries with high gross domestic product gdp per capita would thus be described as developed countries another economic criterion is industrialization countries in which the tertiary and quaternary sectors of industry dominate would thus be described as developed more recently another measure the human development index hdi which combines an economic measure national income with other measures indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent this criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high hdi rating according to the united nations statistics division and it notes that human development index hdi main articles human development index and list of countries by human development index the un hdi is a statistical measure that gauges a countrys level of human development while there is a strong correlation between having a high hdi score and a prosperous economy the un points out that the hdi accounts for more than income or productivity unlike gdp per capita or per capita income the hdi takes into account how income is turned into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development since 1990 norway 2001–2006 2009–2013 japan 1990–91 and 1993 canada 1992 and 1994–2000 and iceland 2007–2008 have had the highest hdi score the top 47 countries have scores ranging from 0.793 in barbados to 0.955 in norway many countries listed by imf or cia as advanced as of 2009 possess an hdi over 0.788 as of 2010 many countries possessing an hdi of 0.788 and over as of 2010 are also listed by imf or cia as advanced as of 2009 thus many advanced economies as of 2009 are characterized by an hdi score of 0.9 or higher as of 2007 since april 2016 the imf classifies macau as an advanced economy the latest index was released on 14 december 2015 and covers the period up to 2014 the following are the 49 countries in the top quartile  having an hdi above 0.8 and classified as possessing a very high human development increase no increase or decrease decrease the number in parentheses represents the number of ranks the country has climbed up or down relative to the ranking in 2014 report as a non-un member the government of taiwan calculates its own hdi which had a value of 0.882 in 2011 additionally while the hdi for the chinese special administrative region of hong kong is calculated by the un it is not for macau the macanese government calculated the territorys hdi to be 0.868 in 2011 these values place both taiwan and macau well within the list of countries with very high human development furthermore in 2009 a united nations project calculated the hdi for all of its members as well as taiwan macau and many dependent territories the hdi values for the countries of san marino and monaco which have not been included in official annual hdi reports were found to be at 0.961 and 0.956 respectively this places both countries firmly within the category of countries with very high human development as well the dependent territories with hdi values equivalent to very high human development were jersey cayman islands bermuda guernsey gibraltar norfolk island faroe islands isle of man british virgin islands falkland islands aruba puerto rico martinique greenland and guam of note the hdi values in the 2009 report were calculated using the old hdi formula while hdi values after the year 2010 are calculated with a different formula net take-home pay of oecd members see also list of countries by net take-home pay while gdp per capita is often used to measure how developed a country is it includes components that do not contribute to a citizens standard of living gdp per capita may increase while real incomes for the majority decline however measuring only net take-home pay gives a more accurate picture of a countrys standard of living the tables show net income figures published annually in the oecd tax database they reflect the annual augmented total net take-home pay by family-type deducting taxes and non-tax compulsory payments since ppp conversion is a widely accepted way to compare income the oecd publishes the data in usd ppps the two major family-types married with 2 children and single with no child at 100 average wage have been selected to give an accurate picture of the wage levels gallup median household and per-capita income in 2013 gallup published a list of countries with median per capita and household income using median rather than mean income results in a much more accurate picture of the average income of the middle class since the data will not be skewed by gains and abnormalities in the extreme ends the figures are in international dollars using purchasing power parity and are based on responses from at least 2,000 adults in each country with the data aggregated from 2006 to 2012 below is a list of the top 30 countries in each category other lists of developed countries some institutions have produced lists of developed countries the un list shown above the cia and some providers of stock market indicesthe ftse group msci sp dow jones etc
