committee in 1971 and as greenpeace co-founder bob hunter wrote “moore was quickly accepted into the inner circle on the basis of his scientific background his reputation as an environmental activist and his ability to inject practical no-nonsense insights into the discussions.” moore traveled to alaska on advanced research with jim bohlen attending wave committee meetings in 1971 moore was a member of the crew of the phyllis cormack a chartered fishing boat which the committee sent across the north pacific in order to draw attention to the us testing of a 5 megaton bomb planned for

organization that was deeply in debt greenpeace organizations began to form throughout north america including cities such as toronto montreal seattle portland los angeles boston and san francisco not all of these offices accepted the authority of the founding organization in canada moores presidency and governance style proved controversial moore and his chosen board in vancouver called for two meetings to formalize his governance proposals during this time david tussman together with the rest of the founders early activists of greenpeace and the majority of greenpeace staff-members announced that the board of the san francisco group intended to separate patrick moores greenpeace foundation from the rest of the greenpeace movement after efforts to settle the matter failed the

presence peaked again after greenpeace in 1986 after leaving greenpeace over differences in policy moore established a family salmon farming business quatsino seafarms at his home in winter harbour he

recruited to represent the indonesian logging firm asia pulp paper app a multi-national accused by activist groups of widespread and illegal rainforest clearance practices although this is strongly disputed by moore views in 2005 moore criticized what he saw as scare tactics and disinformation employed by some within the environmental movement saying that the environmental movement abandoned science and logic in favor of emotion and sensationalism moore contends that for the environmental movement most of the really serious problems have been dealt with seeking now to invent doom and gloom scenarios he suggests they romanticise peasant life as part of an anti-industrial campaign to prevent development in less-developed countries which he describes as anti-human moore was interviewed in the 2007 film documentary the great global warming swindle in which he expressed similar views in 2007 the guardian reported on his writings for the royal society arguing against the theory that mankind was causing global warming noting his advocacy for the felling of tropical rainforests and the planting of genetically engineered crops he has expressed his positive views of logging on the greenspirit website in 2010 moore was commissioned by forestry giant asia pulp and paper to report on its logging activity in indonesias rainforests resulting in a glowing review energy moore was opposed to nuclear power in the 1970s when he believed that nuclear energy was synonymous with nuclear holocaust and everything nuclear was evil but has since come to be in favor of it moore is supported by the nuclear energy institute nei a national organization of pro-nuclear industries and in 2009 he chaired their clean and safe energy coalition as chair he suggested that the mainstream media and the environmentalist movement is not as opposed to nuclear energy as in decades past he argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas emissions would require increased use of nuclear energy to supply baseload power he has also criticized the costs and reliability of wind farms global warming moore calls global warming the most difficult issue facing the scientific community today in terms of being able to actually predict with any kind of accuracy whats going to happen in 2006 he wrote to the royal society arguing there was no scientific proof that mankind was causing global warming and believes that it has a much better correlation with changes in solar activity than co2 levels moore has stated that global warming and the melting of glaciers is not necessarily a negative event because it creates more arable land and the use of forest products drives up demand for wood and spurs the planting of more trees rather than climate change mitigation moore advocates adaptation to global warming in 2014 moore testified to the u.s congress on the subject of global warming “there is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide co2 are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years,” according to moore’s testimony “today we live in an unusually cold period in the history of life on earth and there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species.” moore continued the fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when co2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused co2 emissions are the main cause of global warming when modern life evolved over 500 million years ago co2 was more than 10 times higher than today yet life flourished at this time,” he added “then an ice age occurred 450 million years ago when co2 was 10 times higher than today humans just aren’t capable of predicting global temperature changes a march 2014 episode of the american program hannity featured moore making the statement that the earth has not warmed for the last 17 years in a debate with pundit bob beckel politifact rated moores assertion mostly false remarking that a significant net warming over that time-frame had occurred even though the spread was relatively flat as well as that moore cherry-picked the time-frame to obscure the overall heating trend on july 26 2015 multiple videos were posted on prageru with moore presenting with the title of co-founder of greenpeace included is a 540 video titled why i left greenpeace that explains his version of his involvement and departure from greenpeace other videos presented by moore include what they havent told you about climate change at 134 he states temperatures and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation with a chart are gmos good or bad the truth about co2 and trees are the answer genetically modified foods in 2006 moore addressed a biotechnology industry organization conference in waikiki saying theres no getting away from the fact that over 6 billion people wake up each day on this planet with real needs for food energy and materials and need genetically engineered crops to this end moore supports the adoption of golden rice to prevent vitamin a deficiency health effects of glyphosate during march 2015 in an interview by french investigative journalist paul moreira which was first broadcast on french television station canal in september 2014 moore was asked about the safety of the herbicide glyphosate moore told paul moreira that one could drink a whole quart of it without any harm when moore was challenged to drink a glass of the weedkiller he refused and ended the interview the interview came shortly after the release of a world health organization who report adding glyphosate to a list of probable carcinogens criticism moores views and change of stance see above have evoked controversy in environmentalist arenas he is accused of having abruptly turned his back on the environmental movement and being a mouthpiece for some of the very interests greenpeace was founded to counter his critics point out moores business relations with polluters and clear-cutters through his consultancy moore has earned his living since the early 1990s primarily by consulting for and publicly speaking for a wide variety of corporations and lobby groups such as the nuclear energy institute monte hummel mscf president world wildlife fund canada has claimed that moores book pacific spirit is a collection of pseudoscience and dubious assumptions the writer and environmental activist george monbiot has written critically of moores work with the indonesian logging firm asia pulp paper app moore was hired as a consultant to write an environmental inspection report on app operations according to monbiot moores company is not a monitoring firm and the consultants used were experts in public relations not tropical ecology or indonesian law monbiot has said that sections of the report were directly copied from an app pr brochure the nuclear information and resource service an anti-nuclear group criticized moore saying that his comment in 1976 that it should be remembered that there are employed in the nuclear industry some very high-powered public relations organizations one can no more trust them to tell the truth about nuclear power than about which brand of toothpaste will result in this apparently insoluble problem was seen as forecasting his own future a columbia journalism review editorial criticizes the press for uncritically printing pro-nuclear
