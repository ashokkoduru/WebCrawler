see also reproductive health and womens health maternal health is the health of women during pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period it encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning preconception prenatal and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience in most cases and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in other cases the united nations population fund unfpa estimated that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013 these causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour all of which have highly effective interventions as women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deals per 100,000 live births in 2013 this has resulted in many countries halving their maternal death rates while there has been a decline in world-wide mortality rates much more has to be done high rates still exist particularly in impoverished communities with over 85 living in africa and southern asia the effect of a mothers death results in vulnerable families and their infants if they survive childbirth are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday four elements are essential to maternal death prevention first prenatal care it is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and foetus second skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications third emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are haemorrhage sepsis unsafe abortion hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour lastly postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery during this time bleeding sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth therefore follow-up visits by a health worker is assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended determinants according to a unfpa report a womans chance of dying or becoming disabled during pregnancy and childbirth is closely connected to her social and economic status the norms and values of her culture and the geographic remoteness of her home generally speaking the poorer and more marginalized a woman is the greater her risk of death in fact maternal mortality rates reflect disparities between wealthy and poor countries more than any other measure of health a womans lifetime risk of dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 39 in sub-saharan africa as compared to 1 in 4,700 in industrialized countries povertyaccess to healthcare the risk for maternal death during pregnancy or childbirth in sub-saharan africa is 175 times higher than in developed countries and risk for pregnancy-related illnesses and negative consequences after birth is even higher poverty maternal health and outcomes for the child are all interconnected neonatal deaths in developing countries account for 98 of worldwide yearly neonatal deaths that being said poverty is detrimental to the health of both mother and child women living in poverty-stricken areas are more likely to be obese and engage in unhealthy behaviors such as cigarette smoking and drug use are less likely to engage in or even have access to legitimate prenatal care and are at a significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child a study conducted in kenya observed that common maternal health problems in poverty-stricken areas include hemorrhaging anemia hypertension malaria placenta retention premature labor prolongedcomplicated labor and pre-eclampsia generally adequate prenatal care encompasses medical care and educational social and nutritional services during pregnancy although there are a variety of reasons women choose not to engage in proper prenatal care 71 of low-income women in a us national study had difficulties getting access to prenatal care when they sought it out additionally immigrants and hispanic women are at higher risk than white or black women for receiving little to no prenatal care where level of education is also an indicator since education and race are correlated adolescents are least likely to receive any prenatal care at all throughout several studies women and adolescents ranked inadequate finances and lack of transportation as the most common barriers to receiving proper prenatal care income is strongly correlated with quality of prenatal care sometimes proximity to healthcare facilities and access to transportation have significant effects on whether or not women have access to prenatal care an analysis conducted on maternal healthcare services in mali found that women who lived in rural areas far away from healthcare facilities were less likely to receive prenatal care than those who lived in urban areas furthermore researchers found an even stronger relationship between lack of transportation and prenatal and delivery care in addition to proximity being a predictor of prenatal care access materia and colleagues found similar results for proximity and antenatal care in rural ethiopa hivaids maternal hiv rates vary around the world ranging from 1 to 40 with african and asian countries having the highest rates hivaids can be transmitted to the offspring during the prenatal period childbirth or breastfeeding if a mother is infected with the hivaids virus there is a 25 chance that she will pass on the virus to her offspring if she does not receive proper treatment during pregnancy on the other hand if a mother is treated during her pregnancy there is a 98 chance that her baby will not become infected according to unicef the last decade has seen a large increase in death among young children due to hivaids contracted from their parents especially in countries where poverty is high and education levels are low although several preventative measures do exist cost and infrastructure are two central problems that international organizations and health agencies find when trying to implement solutions to the problem of mother-to-child hiv transmission in developing countries having hivaids while pregnant can also cause heightened health risks for the mother a large concern for hiv-positive pregnant women is the risk of contracting tuberculosis tb andor malaria in developing countries maternal weight gestational weight gain should typically fall between 11-20 pounds in order to improve outcomes for both mother and child increased rates of hypertension diabetes respiratory complications and infections are prevalent in cases of maternal obesity and can have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes obesity is an extremely strong risk factor for gestational diabetes research has found that obese mothers who lose weight at least 10 pounds in-between pregnancies reduce the risk of gestational diabetes during their next pregnancy whereas mothers who gain weight actually increase their risk oral health maternal oral health has been shown to effect the well-being of both the expectant mother and her unborn fetus the 2000 surgeons general report stressed the interdependence of oral health on the overall health and well-being of an individual oral health is especially essential during perinatal period and the future development of the child proper management of oral health has benefits to both mother and child furthermore lack of understanding or maintenance of good oral health for pregnant women may have adverse effects on them and their children hence it is imperative to educate mothers regarding the significance of oral health moreover collaboration and support among physicians across various fields especially among family practitioners and obstetricians is essential in addressing the concerns for maternal oral health in 2007 the maternal oral health project was developed to provide routine oral care to low-income pregnant women in nassau county ny since its inception the program has treated more than 2,000 pregnant women many of whom had significant gum andor tooth problems oral health has numerous implications on overall general health and the quality of life of an individual the surgeon generals report lists various systemic diseases and conditions that have oral manifestations the oral cavity serves as both a site of and a gateway entry of disease for microbial infections which can affect general health status in addition some studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes cardiovascular disease stroke and adverse pregnancy outcomes furthermore the report establishes a relationship between oral health and quality of life including functional psychosocial and economic indicators poor oral health can affect diet nutrition sleep psychological status social interaction school and work benefits and effects according to the unfpa maternal deaths would be reduced by about two-thirds from 287,000 to 105,000 if needs for modern family planning and maternal and newborn health care were met therefore investing in family planning and improved maternal health care brings many benefits including reduced risks of complications and improvement in health for mothers and their children education is also critical with research showing that women with no education were nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than women who had finished secondary school evidence shows that women who are better educated tend to have healthier children education would also improve employment opportunities for women which results in improving their status contributing to family savings reducing poverty and contributing to economic growth all of these invests bring significant benefits and effects not only for women and girls but also their children families communities and their country protection and control of oral health and diseases safeguards a womans health and quality of life before and during pregnancy also it has the potential to decrease the transmission of pathogenic bacteria that occurs from mother to child along with pregnancy come physiological changes for a woman the changes including fluctuating hormones increase the womans susceptibility to oral infections such as periodontal disease this disease impairs the bodys ability to repair and maintain soft tissues it also causes indirect damage through bacterial induction of both inflammatory and immune responses of the host during pregnancy mild inflammation of the gums pregnancy gingivitis is quite common and if left untreated can lead to periodontal disease there have been an increased number of studies establishing associations between periodontal disease and negative health outcomes which include tooth loss cardiovascular disease stroke poor diabetes control and adverse birth outcomes for example one such study found that moderate or severe periodontal disease early in pregnancy was associated with delivery of small-for-gestational-age infant other studies have also found an association between periodontal disease and development of pre-eclampsia and pre-term births another notable oral disease pertinent to maternal child health is dental caries dental caries is the process of tooth decay and the development of what is commonly known as cavities dental carries are transmitted from mother to child vertically colonization of cariogenic bacteria primarily occurs from mother to child through saliva-sharing activities maternal oral flora can ultimately foretell oral flora in offspring in addition other maternal factors such as social behavioral and biological factors can predispose a childs experience with tooth-decay some of these factors include the lack of knowledge a mother possesses concerning oral health which can influence the development of caries among her children compared to children whose mothers have good oral health children whose mothers have bad oral health are five times as likely to have poor oral health poor maintenance of oral health has profound implications on the development of children as mentioned in the surgeons general report oral health affects the quality of life especially children with respect to functional psychological economic and overall emotional well-being of an individual to demonstrate the adverse effects of poor oral health take for example the consequences a simple cavity can have on a child first it is painful this might cause a child to miss school or have poor concentration eventually compromising school performance in addition due to the pain it might result in poor weight gain or growth also children may exhibit reduced self-esteem because of cosmetic issues furthermore it can affect language and impair speech impaired speech development can also result in low self-esteem finally cavities although easily preventable can pose a financial burden of a family public dental services are scarce and costly to individuals who lack dental insurance it may also result in unwarranted visits to emergency department poor oral health permeates into other aspects of life posing threats to overall well-being if not handled timely and effectively collaboration and education the significance of oral health is apparent however many women do not receive dental services before during and after pregnancy even with obvious signs of oral disease there are several factors at play regarding pregnant women not seeking dental care including the role of the health care system and disposition of the woman herself there is a common misconception that it is not safe to obtain dental services while pregnant many prenatal and oral health providers have limited knowledge about the impact and safety of delivering dental services hence they might delay or withhold treatment during pregnancy moreover some prenatal providers are not aware of the importance of oral health on overall general health thus failing to refer their patients to dental providers first and foremost the misconception regarding the impact of dental services while a woman is pregnant needs to be purged there is a consensus that prevention diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases are highly beneficial and can be performed on pregnant women having no added fetal or maternal risk when compared to the risk of providing no oral care equally important is establishing collaboration among clinicians especially maternal health providers with other dental providers there should be coordination among general health and oral health providers especially because of the interdependence of the two fields thus it is imperative to educate and train health providers of the significance of oral health designing methods to incorporate in their respective practices providers most provide education to pregnant women addressing the importance of oral health because these women ultimately control the fate of themselves and their offspring for example providers can illustrate to mothers how to reduce cavities by wiping down the gums of their children with a soft cloth after breastfeeding or bottle-feeding bestowing knowledge and practical applications of good oral health maintenance measures to mothers can help improve overall health of the mother and child there are still other factors in play when analyzing the low use of dental services by pregnant women particularly prevalent among ethnic and racial minorities a major factor is the lack of insurance and or access to dental services for this reason more data needs to be collected and analyzed so that programs are set up to effectively to reach all segments of the population effects on child health and development prenatal health prenatal care is an important part of basic maternal health care it is recommended expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits in which a health worker can check for signs of ill health – such as underweight anaemia or infection – and monitor the health of the foetus during these visits women are counseled on nutrition and hygiene to improve their health prior to and following delivery they can also develop a birth plan laying out how to reach care and what to do in case of an emergency poverty malnutrition and substance abuse may contribute to impaired cognitive motor and behavioral problems across childhood in other words if a mother is not in optimal health during the prenatal period the time while she is pregnant andor the fetus is exposed to teratogens the child is more likely to experience health or developmental difficulties or death the environment in which the mother provides for the embryofetus is critical to its wellbeing well after gestation and birth a teratogen is any agent that can potentially cause a birth defect or negatively alter cognitive and behavioral outcomes dose genetic susceptibility and time of exposure are all factors for the extent of the effect of a teratogen on an embryo or fetus prescription drugs taken during pregnancy such as streptomycin tetracycline some antidepressants progestin synthetic estrogen and accutane as well as over-the-counter drugs such as diet pills can result in teratogenic outcomes for the developing embryofetus additionally high dosages of aspirin are known to lead to maternal and fetal bleeding although low-dose aspirin is usually not harmful newborns whose mothers use heroin during the gestational period often exhibit withdrawal symptoms at birth and are more likely to have attention problems and health issues as they grow up use of stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine during pregnancy are linked to a number of problems for the child such as low birth weight and small head circumference and motor and cognitive developmental delays as well as behavioral problems across childhood the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry found that 6 year-olds whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy scored lower on an intelligence test than children whose mothers had not cigarette smoking during pregnancy can have a multitude of detrimental effects on the health and development of the offspring common results of smoking during pregnancy include pre-term births low birth weights fetal and neonatal deaths respiratory problems and sudden infant death syndrome sids as well as increased risk for cognitive impairment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and other behavioral problems also in a study published in the international journal of cancer children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy experienced a 22 risk increase for non-hodgkin lymphoma although alcohol use in careful moderation one to two servings a few days a week during pregnancy are not generally known to cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder fasd the us surgeon general advises against the consumption of alcohol at all during pregnancy excessive alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fasd which commonly consist of physical and cognitive abnormalities in the child such as facial deformities defective limbs face and heart learning problems below average intelligence and intellectual disability id although hivaids can be transmitted to offspring at different times the most common time that mothers pass on the virus is during pregnancy during the perinatal period the embryofetus can contract the virus through the placenta gestational diabetes is directly linked with obesity in offspring through adolescence additionally children whose mothers had diabetes are more likely to develop type ii diabetes mothers who have gestational diabetes have a high chance of giving birth to very large infants 10 pounds or more because the embryo or fetuss nutrition is based on maternal protein vitamin mineral and total caloric intake infants born to malnourished mothers are more likely to exhibit malformations additionally maternal stress can affect the fetus both directly and indirectly when a mother is under stress physiological changes occur in the body that could harm the developing fetus additionally the mother is more likely to engage in behaviors that could negatively affect the fetus such as tobacco smoking drug use and alcohol abuse childbirth genital herpes is passed to the offspring through the birth canal during delivery in pregnancies where the mother is infected with the virus 25 of babies delivered through an infected birth canal become brain damaged and 13 die hivaids can also be transmitted during childbirth through contact with the mothers body fluids mothers in developed countries may often elect to undergo a caesarean section to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through the birth canal but this option is not always available in developing countries postpartum period globally more than eight million of the 136 million women giving birth each year suffer from excessive bleeding after childbirth this condition—medically referred to as postpartum hemorrhage pph—causes one out of every four maternal deaths that occur annually and accounts for more maternal deaths than any other individual cause deaths due to postpartum hemorrhage disproportionately affect women in developing countries for every woman who dies from causes related to pregnancy an estimated 20 to 30 encounter serious complications at least 15 per cent of all births are complicated by a potentially fatal condition women who survive such complications often require lengthy recovery times and may face lasting physical psychological social and economic consequences although many of these complications are unpredictable almost all are treatable during the postpartum period many mothers breastfeed their infants transmission of hivaids through breastfeeding is a huge issue in developing countries namely in african countries the majority of infants who contract hiv through breast milk do so within the first six weeks of life however in healthy mothers there are many benefits for infants who are breastfed the world health organization recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years of life whereas the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians recommend that mothers do so for at least the first six months and continue as long as is mutually desired infants who are breastfed by healthy mothers not infected with hivaids are less prone to infections such as haemophilus influenza streptococcus pneunoniae vibrio cholerae escherichia coli giardia lamblia group b streptococci staphylococcus epidermidis rotavirus respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus-1 as well as gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media lower rates of infant mortality are observed in breastfed babies in addition to lower rates of sudden infant death syndrome sids decreases in obesity and diseases such as childhood metabolic disease asthma atopic dermatitis type i diabetes and childhood cancers are also seen in children who are breastfed long-term effects for the mother see also maternal death in many developing countries complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute according to the world health organization in its world health report 2005 poor maternal conditions account for the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide after hivaids malaria and tuberculosis most maternal deaths and injuries are caused by biological processes not from disease which can be prevented and have been largely eradicated in the developed world — such as postpartum hemorrhaging which causes 34 of maternal deaths in the developing world but only 13 of maternal deaths in developed countries although high-quality accessible health care has made maternal death a rare event in developed countries where only 1 of maternal deaths occur these complications can often be fatal in the developing world because single most important intervention for safe motherhood is to make sure that a trained provider with midwifery skills is present at every birth that transport is available to referral services and that quality emergency obstetric care is available in 2008 342,900 women died while pregnant or from childbirth worldwide although a high number this was a significant drop from 1980 when 526,300 women died from the same causes this improvement was caused by lower pregnancy rates in some countries higher income which improves nutrition and access to health care more education for women and the increasing availability of skilled birth attendants — people with training in basic and emergency obstetric care — to help women give birth the situation was especially led by improvements in large countries like india and china which helped to drive down the overall death rates in india the government started paying for prenatal and delivery care to ensure access and saw successes in reducing maternal mortality so much so that india is cited as the major reason for the decreasing global rates of maternal mortality maternal health problems also include complications from childbirth that do not result in death for every woman that dies during childbirth approximately 20 suffer from infection injury or disability almost 50 of the births in developing countries still take place without a medically skilled attendant to aid the mother and the ratio is even higher in south asia women in sub-saharan africa mainly rely on traditional birth attendants tbas who have little or no formal health care training in recognition of their role some countries and non-governmental organizations are making efforts to train tbas in maternal health topics in order to improve the chances for better health outcomes among mothers and babies breastfeeding provides women with several long-term benefits women who breastfeed experience better glucose levels lipid metabolism and blood pressure and lose pregnancy weight faster than those who do not additionally women who breastfeed experience lower rates of breast cancer ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes however it is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding provides substantial benefits to women who are not infected with hiv in countries where hivaids rates are high such as south africa and kenya the virus is a leading cause of maternal mortality especially in mothers who breastfeed a complication is that many hiv-infected mothers cannot afford formula and thus have no way of preventing transmission to the child through breast milk or avoiding health risks for themselves in cases like this mothers have no choice but to breastfeed their infants regardless of their knowledge of the harmful effects global situation the u.s joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations calls maternal mortality a sentinel event and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system maternal mortality data is said to be an important indicator of overall health system quality because pregnant women survive in sanitary safe well-staffed and stocked facilities if new mothers are thriving it indicates that the health care system is doing its job if not problems likely exist according to garret increasing maternal survival along with life expectancy is an important goal for the world health community as they show that other health issues are also improving if these areas improve disease-specific improvements are also better able to positively impact populations worldwide the maternal mortality ratio mmr has decreased with south-east asia seeing the most dramatic decrease of 59 and africa seeing a decline of 27 there are no regions that are on track to meet the millennium development goal of decreasing maternal mortality by 75 by the year 2015 proposed solutions the world bank estimated that a total of 3.00 us dollars per person a year can provide basic family planning maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries many non-profit organizations have programs educating the public and gaining access to emergency obstetric care for mothers in developing countries the united nations population fund unpfa recently began its campaign on accelerated reduction of maternal mortality in africa carmma focusing on providing quality healthcare to mothers one of the programs within carmma is sierra leone providing free healthcare to mothers and children this initiative has widespread support from african leaders and was started in conjunction with the african union health ministers improving maternal health is the fifth of the united nations eight millennium development goals mdgs targeting a reduction in the number of women dying during pregnancy and childbirth by three quarters by 2015 notably by increasing the usage of skilled birth attendants contraception and family planning the current decline of maternal deaths is only half of what is necessary to achieve this goal and in several regions such as sub-saharan africa the maternal mortality rate is actually increasing however one country that may meet their mdg 5 is nepal which has it appears reduced its maternal mortality by more than 50 since the early 1990s as the 2015 deadline for the mdgs approaches an understanding of the policy developments leading to the inclusion of maternal health within the mdgs is essential for future advocacy efforts decreasing the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in developing countries is important because poor maternal health is both an indicator and a cause of extreme poverty according to tamar manuelyan atinc vice president for human development at the world bank maternal deaths are both caused by poverty and are a cause of it the costs of childbirth can quickly exhaust a familys income bringing with it even more financial hardship developed countries had rates of maternal mortality similar to those of developing countries until the early 20th century therefore several lessons can be learned from the west during the 19th century sweden had high levels of maternal mortality and there was a strong support within the country to reduce mortality rate to fewer than 300 per 100,000 live births the swedish government began public health initiatives to train enough midwives to attend all births this approach was also later used by norway denmark and the netherlands who also experienced similar successes increasing contraceptive usage and family planning also improves maternal health through reduction in numbers of higher risk pregnancies in nepal a strong emphasis was placed on providing family planning to rural regions and it was shown to be effective madagascar saw a dramatic increase in contraceptive use after instituting a nationwide family planning program the rate of contraceptive use increased from 5.1 in 1992 to 29 in 2008 see also child development maternal health task force global health global
