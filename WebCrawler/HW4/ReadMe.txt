Task 1:
The given java file is modified a little to retrieve the results in the required format.
It is attached in the folder. To run it we need to add the following libraries
1) lucene-core-VERSION.jar
2) lucene-queryparser-VERSION.jar
3) lucene-analyzers-common-VERSION.jar.

Task 2:
The Class of the retriever.py is Retriever

It can run directly by calling 

python retriever.py


Running the python file starts a search engine which can be searched upon the files present in the parsed_corpus folder.

After searching the results are stored in required format in a text file which has the same name as the query

If you type ‘hw4’, the four queries given in the homework will be executed automatically and the four text files will be created in the current folder.


If you type ‘exit’,  Search engine stops.

Results:
1. The Results of the home work are present in the MyCode_Ranked_Docs folder.
The four individual test files represent the results for the individual queries.

2. The results of running the code against Lucene library are present in Lucene_Ranked_Docs folder.
