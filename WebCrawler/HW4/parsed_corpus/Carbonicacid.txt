formula h2co3 equivalently ocoh2 it is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water carbonated water because such solutions contain small amounts of h2co3 in physiology carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs carbonic acid which is a weak acid forms two kinds of salts the carbonates and the bicarbonates in geology carbonic acid causes limestone to dissolve producing calcium bicarbonate which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites the long-held belief that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound was disproved in 1993 by the preparation of the pure substance this was independently confirmed in 2011 chemical equilibrium when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it exists in chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid the hydration equilibrium constant at 25 °c is called kh which in the case of carbonic acid is h2co3co2 ≈ 1.7×10 in pure water and ≈ 1.2×10 in seawater hence the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid remaining as co2 molecules in the absence of a catalyst the equilibrium is reached quite slowly the rate constants are 0.039 s for the forward reaction co2  h2o → h2co3 and 23 s for the reverse reaction h2co3 → co2  h2o carbonic acid is used in the making of soft drinks inexpensive and artificially carbonated sparkling wines and other bubbly drinks the addition of two molecules of water to co2 would give orthocarbonic acid coh4 which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate with excess base carbonic acid reacts to give carbonate salts because carbon dioxide is non-polar it cannot dissolve in the bloodstream to travel to the lungs as such carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid which is polar and thus can travel through the body in the lungs carbonic anhydrase converts carbonic acid back into water and carbon dioxide to expel carbon dioxide through the lungs without losing water role of carbonic acid in blood carbonic acid is an intermediate step on the transport of co2 out of the body via respiratory gas exchange the hydration reaction of co2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase which both increases the reaction rate and dissociates a hydrogen ion h from the resulting carbonic acid leaving bicarbonate hco3 dissolved in the blood plasma this catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs where it converts the bicarbonate back into co2 and allows it to be expelled this equilibration plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood a 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may have pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum role of carbonic acid in ocean chemistry the oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the co2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels.  it has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the oceans average surface ph to shift by about −0.1 unit from pre-industrial levels this theory is known as ocean acidification acidity of carbonic acid carbonic acid is one of the polyprotic acids it is diprotic – it has two protons which may dissociate from the parent molecule thus there are two dissociation constants the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate also called hydrogen carbonate ion hco3 care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid in aqueous solution carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and the concentration of h2co3 is much lower than the concentration of co2 in many analyses h2co3 includes dissolved co2 referred to as co2aq h2co3 is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation the equation may be rewritten as follows whereas this apparent pka is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid it is ambiguous it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide as it is particularly useful for calculating the ph of co2-containing solutions a similar situation applies to sulfurous acid h2so3 which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated sulfur dioxide the second constant is for the dissociation of the bicarbonate ion into the carbonate ion co3 the three acidity constants are defined as follows k a 1 h hco 3 − h 2 co 3 k a app h hco 3 − h 2

composition of carbonic acid solutions at a given temperature the composition of a pure carbonic acid solution or of a pure co2 solution is completely determined by the partial pressure p co 2 displaystyle ptextco2 of carbon dioxide above the solution to calculate this composition account must be taken of the above equilibria between the three different carbonate forms h2co3 hco3 and co3 as

between the dissolved co2 and the gaseous co2 above the solution the corresponding equilibrium equations together with the h oh − 10 − 14 displaystyle texthtextoh-10-14 relation and the charge

solution is fully determined by p co 2 displaystyle ptextco2  the equation obtained for h is a cubic whose numerical solution yields the following values for the ph and the different species concentrations we see that in the total range of pressure the ph is always largely lower than pka2 so that the co3 concentration is always negligible with respect to hco3 concentration in fact co3 plays no quantitative role in the present calculation see remark below for vanishing p co 2 displaystyle ptextco2  the ph is close to the one of pure water ph 7 and the dissolved carbon is essentially in the hco3 form for normal atmospheric conditions p co 2 3.5 × 10 − 4 displaystyle ptextco23.5times 10-4 atm we get a slightly acid solution ph 5.7 and the dissolved carbon is now essentially in the co2 form from this pressure on oh becomes also negligible so that the ionized part of the solution is now an equimolar mixture of h and hco3 for a co2 pressure typical of the one in carbonated drink bottles p co 2 displaystyle ptextco2 ~ 2.5 atm we get a relatively acid medium ph 3.7 with a high concentration of dissolved co2 these features contribute to the sour and sparkling taste of these drinks between 2.5 and 10 atm the ph crosses the pka1 value 3.60 giving a dominant h2co3 concentration with respect to hco3 at high pressures a plot of the equilibrium concentrations of these different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon and which species is dominant as a function of the ph of the solution is known as a bjerrum plot as noted above co3 may be neglected for this specific problem resulting in the following very precise analytical expression for h spectroscopic studies of carbonic acid theoretical calculations show that the presence of even a single molecule of water causes carbonic acid to revert to carbon dioxide and water in the absence of water the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid is predicted to be very slow with a half-life of 180,000 years this may only apply to isolated carbonic acid molecules however as it has been predicted to catalyze its own decomposition the longstanding belief was that pure carbonic acid cannot be obtained at room temperatures about 20 °c or about 70 °f due to its catalytic destruction by water it has been discovered that it can be generated by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy radiation and then warming to remove the excess water the carbonic acid that remains is characterized by infrared spectroscopy the fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid h2o co2 mixture may suggest that h2co3 might be found in outer space where frozen ices of h2o and co2 are common as are cosmic rays and ultraviolet light to help them react the same carbonic acid polymorph denoted beta-carbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum which causes protonation of bicarbonate followed by removal of the solvent the previously suggested alpha-carbonic acid which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was shown to be a monomethyl ester ch3ocooh
