agrarian officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds plants and animals for import into the united states in 1837 henry leavitt ellsworth a yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture became commissioner of patents a position within the department of state he began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the congress and agricultural societies in 1839 congress established the agricultural division within the patent office and allotted 1,000 for the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes ellsworths interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the new seeds and plants a clerk to collect agricultural statistics statewide reports about crops in different regions and the application of chemistry to agriculture ellsworth was called the father of the department of agriculture in 1849 the patent office was transferred to the newly created department of the interior in the ensuing years agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring formation and subsequent history on may 15 1862 abraham lincoln established the independent department of agriculture to be headed by a commissioner without cabinet status and the agriculturalist isaac newton was appointed to be the first such commissioner lincoln called it the peoples department in the 1880s varied advocacy groups were lobbying for cabinet representation business interests sought a department of commerce and industry and farmers tried to raise the department of agriculture to cabinet rank in 1887 the house of representatives and senate passed bills giving cabinet status to the department of agriculture and labor but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor finally on february 9 1889 president grover cleveland signed a bill into law elevating the department of agriculture to cabinet level in 1887 the hatch act provided for the federal funding of agricultural experiment stations in each state the smith-lever act of 1914 then funded cooperative extension services in each state to teach agriculture home economics and other subjects to the public

and access to other programs well into the 1990s the effect of this discrimination has been the reduction in the number of african-american farmers in the united states in 1999 the usda settled a class action lawsuit the pigford case alleging discrimination against african-american farmers in the late twentieth century the governments settlement of nearly 1 billion with more than 13,300

in-state usda agencies across the nation black farmers alleged and the usda later agreed they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government on a national level farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers since they were denied government loans emergency or disaster assistance and other aid many black farmers lost their farms and homes pigford v glickman main article pigford v glickman following long-standing concerns black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the usda filed in federal court in 1997 an attorney called it the most organized largest civil rights case in the history of the country also in 1997 black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the usda headquarters in washington d.c protests in front of the usda were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers representatives of the national black farmers association met with president bill clinton and other administration officials at the white house and nbfas president testified before the united states house committee on agriculture in pigford v glickman u.s federal district court judge paul l friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on april 14 1999 the settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers but the nbfa would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded nevertheless the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in american history lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than 2 billion some farmers would have their debts forgiven judge friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement farmers in alabama mississippi arkansas and georgia were among those affected by the settlement reopening of case the nbfas president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement including before the united states senate committee on agriculture on september 12 2000 when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement nbfa asked congress to pass legislation that would ensure a full resolution of the discrimination cases environmental working group and nbfa issued a report in july 2004 accusing the usda of withholding nearly three out of every four dollars in the multibillion-dollar settlement of discrimination cases the report says that the u.s department of justice and the usda pursued a path of willful obstruction of justice in blocking many of the cases it was later revealed that one doj staff general attorney was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers cases nbfa called for all those cases to be reheard in 2006 the government accountability office gao issued a report highly critical of the usda in its handling of the black farmers cases nbfa continued to lobby congress to provide relief nbfas boyd secured congressional support for legislation that would provide 100 million in funds to settle late-filer cases in 2006 a bill was introduced into the house of representatives and later the senate by senator george felix allen in 2007 boyd testified before the united states house committee on the judiciary about this legislation as the organization was making headway by gathering congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some usda farm services agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers president barack obama then a u.s senator lent his support to the black farmers issues in 2007 a bill cosponsored by obama passed the senate in 2007 the senate and house versions of the black farmers bill reopening black farmers discrimination cases became law in 2008 the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers according to some news reports in 2008 hundreds of black farmers denied a chance to have their cases heard in the pigford settlement filed a new lawsuit against usda in 2008 the gao issued a report criticizing the usdas handling of discrimination complaints the gao recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints after numerous public rallies and an intensive nbfa member lobbying effort congress approved and obama signed into law in december 2010 legislation that set aside 1.15 billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers cases nbfas john w boyd jr attended the bill-signing ceremony at the white house as of 2013 90,000 african-american hispanic female and native american farmers had filed claims some fraudulent or even transparently bogus lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the usda practice of discarding denied applications after three years in maple hill north carolina the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 african-americans being paid the result of such longstanding discrimination is that black farmers have been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers in 1920 1 in 7 u.s farmers was african-american and now the number is 1 in 100 usda spokesman ed loyd when acknowledging that the usda loan process was unfair to minority farmers has claimed it is hard to determine the effect on
