bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances such as pesticides or other chemicals in an organism bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a  possibly toxic  substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost by catabolism and excretion thus the longer the biological half-life of a toxic substance the greater the risk of chronic poisoning even if environmental levels of the toxin are not very high bioaccumulation for example in fish can be predicted by models hypotheses for molecular size cutoff criteria for use as bioaccumulation potential indicators are not supported by data biotransformation can strongly modify bioaccumulation of chemicals in an organism bioconcentration is a related but more specific term referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone by contrast bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined e.g water food air etc examples an example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase as mad as a hatter 18th and 19th century england the process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved mercury which forms organic species such as methylmercury which is lipid-soluble and tends to accumulate in the brain resulting in mercury poisoning other lipid-soluble fat-soluble poisons include tetraethyllead compounds the lead in leaded petrol and ddt these compounds are stored in the bodys fat and when the fatty tissues are used for energy the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning strontium-90 part of the fallout from atomic bombs is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in osteogenesis where its radiation can cause damage for a long time naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate the marine algal blooms known as red tides can result in local filter feeding organisms such as mussels and oysters becoming toxic coral fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as ciguatera when they accumulate a toxin called ciguatoxin from reef algae some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense by consuming toxic plants or animal prey a species may accumulate the toxin which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator one example is the tobacco hornworm which concentrates nicotine to a toxic level in its body as it consumes tobacco plants poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms the classic example is of vitamin a which becomes concentrated in carnivore livers of e.g polar bears as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores seals they accumulate extremely large amounts of vitamin a in their livers it was known by the native peoples of the arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten but arctic explorers have suffered hypervitaminosis a from eating the bear livers and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of antarctic explorers eating husky dog livers one notable example of this is the expedition of sir douglas mawson where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs coastal fish such as the smooth toadfish and seabirds such as the atlantic puffin are often monitored for heavy metal bioaccumulation in some eutrophic aquatic systems biodilution can occur this trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to dilute the concentration of the pollutant see also biomagnification magnification of toxins with increasing trophic level chelation therapy international pops elimination network persistent organic pollutants phytoremediation removal of pollutants by bioaccumulation in plants list of environment topics usgs toxic substances hydrology program bioaccumulation bioaccumulation of marine pollutants and discussion by g w bryan m waldichuk r j pentreath and ann darracott philosophical transactions of the royal society of london series b biological sciences stadnicka j schirmer k ashauer r 2012 predicting concentrations of organic chemicals in fish by using toxicokinetic models environ sci technol doi10.1021es2043728 jon arnot et al molecular size cutoff criteria for screening bioaccumulation potential fact or fiction doi10.1897ieam2009-051.1 ashauer r hintermeister a oconnor i elumelu m et al 2012 significance of xenobiotic metabolism for bioaccumulation kinetics of organic chemicals in gammarus pulex environ sci technol doi10.1021es204611h external links httpwww.marietta.edu~biol1022bioma95.html httpwww.mhhe.combiosciesp2001gbiofolderstructureecm3s4 excellent graphic httptoxics.usgs.govdefinitionsbiomagnification.html httpwww.pbtprofiler.netcriteria.asp httpwww.ecotoxmodels.orgresearch-publications-projectsbioaccumulation-biotransformation
