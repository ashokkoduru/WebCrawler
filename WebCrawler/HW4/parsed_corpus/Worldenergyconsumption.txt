see also world energy resources and worldwide energy supply world energy consumption is the total energy used by all of human civilization typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanitys endeavors across every single industrial and technological sector across every country being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanitys social-economic-political sphere institutions such as the international energy agency iea the u.s energy information administration eia and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions the iea estimates that in 2013 total world energy consumption was 9,301 mtoe  or 3.89 × 10 joules equal to an average power consumption of 12.3 terawatts from 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydro power and renewable energy renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period which can possibly be explained by an increase in international investment in renewable energy the demand for nuclear energy decreased possibly due to the accidents at chernobyl and three mile island in 2011 expenditures on energy totaled over 6 trillion usd or about 10 of the world gross domestic product gdp europe spends close to one quarter of the worlds energy expenditures north america close to 20 and japan 6 overview further information total primary energy supply energy supply consumption and electricity world total primary energy supply tpes or primary energy differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers for instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the worlds primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity in 2012 world primary energy supply amounted to 155,505 terawatt-hour twh or 13,371 mtoe while the world final energy consumption was 104,426 twh or about 32 less than the total supply world final energy consumption includes products as lubricants asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel this non-energy use amounted to 9,404 twh 809 mtoe in 2012 the worlds electricity consumption was 18,608 twh in 2012 this figure is about 18 smaller than the generated electricity due to grid losses storage losses and self-consumption from power plants gross generation cogeneration chp power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes the united states energy information administration regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources the most recent estimate of the world energy consumption was 5.67 × 10 joules or 157,481 twh in 2013 according to the iea the total world energy consumption was 143,851 twh in 2008 133,602 twh in 2005 117,687 twh in 2000 and 102,569 twh in 1990 total world electricity consumption was 19,504 twh in 2013 16,503 twh in 2008 15,105 twh in 2005 and 12,116 twh in 2000 in 2012 approximately 22 of world energy was consumed in north america 5 was consumed south and central america 23 was consumed in europe and eurasia 3 was consumed in africa and 40 was consumed in the asia pacific region in 2013 world energy consumption by power source was oil 31.1 coal 28.9 natural gas 21.4 biofuels and waste 10.2 nuclear 4.8 hydro 2.4 and other solar wind geothermal heat etc 1.2 oil coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national energy action plans such as the eu 2009 renewable energy directive to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas one such initiative was the united nations development programmes world energy assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources from 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil during this period oil coal and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy the following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period trends the energy consumption growth in the g20 slowed down to 2 in 2011 after the strong increase of 2010 the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth for several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption according to iea data from 1990 to 2008 the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27 regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008 the middle east increased by 170 china by 146 india by 91 africa by 70 latin america by 66 the usa by 20 the eu-27 block by 7 and world overall grew by 39 in 2008 total worldwide energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours twh or 474 exajoules ej this corresponds to an average global power demand of 15 terawatts tw in 2012 energy demand increased to 158,000 twh 567 ej equivalent to an average power use of 18.0 tw energy consumption in the g20 increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009 in 2009 world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1 or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent mtoe as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world gdp by 0.6 in 2009 this evolution is the result of two contrasting trends energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in asia 4 conversely in oecd consumption was severely cut by 4.7 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels in north america europe and the cis consumptions shrank by 4.5 5 and 8.5 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity china became the worlds largest energy consumer 18 of the total since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009 up from 4 in 2008 oil remained the largest energy source 33 despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time coal posted a growing role in the worlds energy consumption in 2009 it accounted for 27 of the total most energy is used in the country of origin since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials in 2008 the share export of the total energy production by fuel was oil 50 1,9523,941 mt gas 25 8003,149 bcm and hard coal 14 7935,845 mt most of the worlds high energy resources are from the conversion of the suns rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy some is directly or indirectly usable for example via solar pvthermal wind hydro or wave power the total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter see solar constant though it fluctuates by about 6.9 during the year due to the earths varying distance from the sun this value after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the earth is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet about half 89,000 tw reaches the earths surface the estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4  yottajoule yj or 4 × 10 joules and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium exceeding 2.5 yj fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3 yj if estimates of reserves of methane clathrates are accurate and become technically extractable the total power flux from the sun intercepting the earth is 5.5 yj per year though not all of this is available for human consumption the iea estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of 48 trillion and credible policy frameworks according to iea 2012 the goal of limiting warming to 2 °c is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes if action is not taken before 2017 co2 emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017 fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix supported by 523 billion subsidies in 2011 up almost 30 on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables emissions global warming emissions resulting from energy production are an environmental problem efforts to resolve this include the kyoto protocol which is a un agreement aiming to reduce harmful climate impacts which a number of nations have signed limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius thought to be a risk by the sei is now doubtful to limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees celsius rise would demand a 75 decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050 if the population is 10 billion in 2050 across 40 years this averages to a 2 decrease every year in 2011 the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem hypothetically according to robert engelman worldwatch institute in order to prevent collapse human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population 2009 greenhouse gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides sox nitrous oxides nox and particulate matter pm are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution biomass combustion is a major contributor even though it is typically counted as renewable in energy statistics in addition to producing air pollution like fossil fuel combustion most biomass has high co2 emissions by fuel fossil fuels main article fossil fuel the twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels between 1980 and 2006 the worldwide annual growth rate was 2 according to the us energy information administrations 2006 estimate the estimated 471.8 ej total consumption in 2004 was divided as given in the table above with fossil fuels supplying 86 of the worlds energy coal main article coal in 2000 china accounted for 28 of world coal consumption other asia consumed 19 north america 25 and the eu 14 the single greatest coal-consuming country is china its share of the world coal production was 28 in 2000 and rose to 48 in 2009 in contrast to chinas ~70 increase in coal consumption world coal use increased 48 from 2000 to 2009 in practice the majority of this growth occurred in china and the rest in other asia chinas energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector the majority of which comes from coal consumption world annual coal production increased 1,905 mt or 32 in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005 of which over 70 was in china and 8 in india coal production was in 2011 7,783 mt and 2009 6,903 mt equal to 12.7 production increase in two years if production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008 proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years this is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world according to iea coal information 2007 world production and use of coal have increased considerably in recent years according to james hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce co2 emissions from coal indonesia and australia exported together 57.1 of the world coal export in 2011 china japan south korea india and taiwan had 65 share of all the world coal import in 2011 oil main article petroleum coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century with the advent of the automobile airplanes and the spreading use of electricity oil became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century the growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973 after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 us dollars per barrel there was a shift away from oil coal natural gas and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency in the u.s the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon japan which bore the brunt of the oil shocks made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world from 1965 to 2008 the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased from 2003 to 2008 coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel it is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present natural gas main article natural gas in 2009 the world use of natural gas was 131 compared to year 2000 66 of this growth was outside eu north america latin america and russia others include middle east asia and africa the gas supply increased also in the previous regions 8.6 in the eu and 16 in the north america 2000–2009 nuclear power main article nuclear power as of 1 july 2016 the world had 444 operable grid-electric nuclear power reactors with 62 others under construction since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid 1950s 2008 was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid although two were connected in 2009 annual generation of nuclear power has been on a slight downward trend since 2007 decreasing 1.8 in 2009 to 2558 twh and another 1.6 in 2011 to 2518 twh despite increases in production from most countries worldwide because those increases were more than offset by decreases in germany and japan nuclear power met 11.7 of the worlds electricity demand in 2011 source ieaoecd renewable energy main articles renewable energy and renewable energy commercialization
