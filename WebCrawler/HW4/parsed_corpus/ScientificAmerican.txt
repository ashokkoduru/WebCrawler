into something of a workbench publication similar to the twentieth-century incarnation of popular science in the years after world war ii the magazine fell into decline in 1948 three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine to be called the sciences purchased the assets of the old scientific american instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine thus the partners—publisher gerard piel editor dennis flanagan and general manager donald h miller jr.—essentially created a new magazine miller retired in 1979 flanagan and piel in 1984 when gerard piels son jonathan became president and editor circulation had grown fifteen-fold since 1948 in 1986 it was sold to the holtzbrinck group of germany which has owned it since in the fall of 2008

romanian russian and spanish from 1902 to 1911 scientific american supervised the publication of the encyclopedia americana which during some of that period was known as the americana first issue it originally styled itself the advocate of industry and enterprise and journal of mechanical and other improvements on the front page of the first issue was the engraving of improved rail-road cars the masthead had a commentary as follows scientific american published every thursday morning at no 11 spruce street new york no 16 state street boston and no 2l arcade philadelphia the principal office being in new york by rufus porter each number will be furnished with from two to five original engravings many of them elegant and illustrative of new inventions scientific principles and curious works and will contain in high addition to the most interesting news of passing events general notices of progress of mechanical and other scientific improvements american and foreign improvements and inventions catalogues of american patents scientific essays illustrative of the principles of the sciences of mechanics chemistry and architecture useful information and instruction in various arts and trades curious philosophical experiments miscellaneous intelligence music and poetry this paper is especially entitled to the patronage of mechanics and manufactures being the only paper in america devoted to the interest of those classes but is particularly useful to farmers as it will not only appraise them of improvements in agriculture implements but instruct them in various mechanical trades and guard them against impositions as a family newspaper it will convey more useful intelligence to children and young people than five times its cost in school instruction another important argument in favor of this paper is that it will be worth two dollars at the end of the year when the volume is complete old volumes of the new york mechanic being now worth double the original cost in cash terms the scientific american will be furnished to subscribers at 2.00 per annum  one dollar in advance and the balance in six months five copies will be sent to one address six months for four dollars in advance any person procuring two or more subscribers will be entitled to a commission of 25 cents each the commentary under the illustration gives the flavor of its style at the time there is perhaps no mechanical subject in which improvement has advanced so rapidly within the last ten years as that of railroad passenger cars let any person contrast the awkward and uncouth cars of 35 with the superbly splendid long cars now running on several of the eastern roads and he will find it difficult to convey to a third party a correct idea of the vast extent of improvement some of the most elegant cars of this class and which are of a capacity to accommodate from sixty to eighty passengers and run with a steadiness hardly equaled by a steamboat in still water are manufactured by davenport bridges at their establishment in cambridgeport mass the manufacturers have recently introduced a variety of excellent improvements in the construction of trucks

an issue containing an article by hans bethe that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear hydrogen bomb subsequent review of the material determined that the aec had overreacted the incident was important for the new scientific americans history as the aecs decision to burn 3000 copies of an early press-run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be book burning in a free society when publisher gerard piel leaked the incident to the press in its january 2002 issue scientific american published a series of criticisms of the bjørn lomborg book the skeptical environmentalist cato institute fellow patrick j michaels said the attacks came because the book threatens billions of taxpayer dollars that go into the global change kitty every year journalist ronald bailey called the criticism disturbing and dishonest writing the subhead of the review section science defends itself against the skeptical environmentalist gives the show away religious and political views need to defend themselves against criticism but science is supposed to be a process for determining the facts the may 2007 issue featured a column by michael shermer
