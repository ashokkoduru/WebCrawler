the institution of mechanical engineers imeche is an independent engineering society headquartered in central london that represents mechanical engineers with over 113,000 members in 140 countries working across industries such as railway automotive aerospace manufacturing energy biomedical and construction the cinstitution is licensed by the engineering council engc to assess candidates for inclusion on its register of chartered engineers the institution was founded at the queens hotel birmingham by george stephenson in 1847 following an informal meeting at locomotive designer charles beyers house in cecil street manchester it received a royal charter in 1930 the institutions headquarters purpose-built for the institution in 1899 are situated at one birdcage walk london the first woman to be elected to the institution was verena holmes in 1919 origins the institution of mechanical engineers was founded on 27 january 1847 in the queens hotel next to curzon street railway station in birmingham by the railway pioneer george stephenson and others the founding of the institution is said to have been spurred by outrage that george stephenson the most famous mechanical engineer of the age had been refused admission to the institution of civil engineers unless he sent in a probationary essay as proof of his capacity as an engineer however this account has been challenged as an exaggeration though there was certainly coolness between stephenson and the institution of civil engineers it is more likely that the motivation behind the founding of the institution of mechanical engineers was simply the need for a specific home for the growing number of mechanical engineers employed in the burgeoning railway and manufacturing industries charles beyer proposed that george stephenson become the institutions first president in 1847 followed by his son robert stephenson in 1849 beyer became vice president and was one of the first to present papers to the institution charles geach was the imeches first treasurer throughout the 19th and 20th centuries some of britains most notable engineers held the position of president including joseph whitworth carl wilhelm siemens and sir harry ricardo it operated from premises in birmingham until 1877 when it moved to london taking up its present headquarters on birdcage walk in 1899 one birdcage walk upon its move to london in 1877 the institution rented premises at no 10 victoria chambers where it remained for 20 years in 1895 the institution bought a plot of land at storeys gate on the eastern end of birdcage walk for £9,500 architect basil slade looked to the newly completed admiralty buildings facing the site for inspiration the building was designed in the queen anne streaky bacon style in red brick and portland stone inside there were several features that were state of the art for the time including a telephone a 54-inch fan in the lecture theatre for driving air into the building an electric lift from the otis elevator company and a synchronome master-clock which controlled all house timepieces in 1933 architect james miller who also designed the neighbouring institution of civil engineers remodelled the building expanding the library and introducing electric lighting the building would go on to host the first public presentation of frank whittles jet engine in 1945 in 1943 it became the venue for the royal electrical and mechanical engineers reme planning of operation overlord and the invasion of normandy today one birdcage walk hosts events lectures seminars and meetings in 17 conference and meeting rooms named after notable former members of the institution such as frank whittle george stephenson and charles parsons membership grades and post-nominals the following are membership grades with post-nominals  affiliate no post-nominal the grade for students apprentices and those interested in or involved in mechanical engineering who do not meet the requirements for the following grades amimeche associate member of the institution of mechanical engineers this is the grade for graduates of acceptable degrees or equivalents in engineering mathematics or science mimeche member of the institution of mechanical engineers for those who meet the educational and professional requirements for registration as a chartered engineer ceng or incorporated engineer ieng or engineering technician engtech in mechanical engineering  fimeche fellow of the institution of mechanical engineers this is the highest class of elected membership and is awarded to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional commitment to and innovation in mechanical engineering awards main article engineering heritage awards the engineering heritage awards were created in 1984 to help recognise and promote the value of artefacts locations collections and landmarks of significant engineering importance along with the manufacturer the institution also runs the manufacturer mx awards and formula student the worlds largest student motorsport event presidents as of 2016 there have been 131 presidents of the institution who since 1922 have been elected annually for one year the first president was george stephenson followed by his son robert joseph whitworth john penn and william armstrong are the only persons to have served two terms pamela liversidge in 1997-98 was the first female president and professor isobel pollock became the second in may 2012 past presidents engineering committees the institution of mechanical engineers has a number of committees that work to promote and develop thought leadership in different industry sectors the institution has 8 divisions  aerospace automobile biomedical engineering association construction building services cross-sector technologies manufacturing industries power industries process industries and railway biomedical engineering association bmea aims to bring together key workers from both medicine and engineering to discuss the latest advances and issues to enable networking among different industry leaders and to promote the field of medical engineering also known as bioengineering or biomedical engineering to government healthcare professionals and the wider public this committee offers seminars lectures and conferences every year the journal of engineering in medicine the annual student project competition the railway division was formed in 1969 when imeche amalgamated with the institution of locomotive engineers see also engineering james watt international medal chartered engineer
