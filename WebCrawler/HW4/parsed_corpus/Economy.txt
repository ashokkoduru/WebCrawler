distributing goods or services there has been some sort of economy economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex sumer developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money while the babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of in terms of ruleslaws on debt legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices and private property the babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society law concepts they developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems complete with courts jails and government records the ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming the shekel referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency the first usage of the term came from mesopotamia circa 3000 bc and referred to a specific mass of barley which related other values in a metric such as silver bronze copper etc a barleyshekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight just as the british pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver for most people the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships there were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces in ancient greece where the present english word economy originated many people were bond slaves of the freeholders economic discussion was driven by scarcity middle ages in medieval times what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence level most exchange occurred within social groups on top of this the great conquerors raised venture capital from ventura ital risk to finance their captures the capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the new world merchants such as jakob fugger 1459–1525 and giovanni di bicci de medici 1360–1428 founded the first banks the discoveries of marco polo 1254–1324 christopher columbus 1451–1506 and vasco da gama 1469–1524 led to a first global economy the first enterprises were trading establishments in 1513 the first stock exchange was founded in antwerpen economy at the time meant primarily trade early modern times the

finance national projects such as wars and infrastructure economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state the industrial revolution main article industrial revolution the first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the scotsman adam smith 1723–1790 who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy a reaction to mercantilism and also later economics student adam mari he defined the elements of a national economy products are offered at a natural price generated by the use of competition  supply and demand  and the division of labor he maintained that the basic motive for free trade is human self-interest the so-called self-interest hypothesis became the anthropological basis for economics thomas malthus 1766–1834 transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation the industrial revolution was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in agriculture manufacturing mining and transport had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the united kingdom then subsequently spreading throughout europe north america and eventually the world the onset of the industrial revolution marked a major turning point in human history almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way in europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism today protectionism and led to economic growth the period today is called industrial revolution because the system of production production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods after world war ii after the chaos of two world wars and the devastating great depression policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy this was explored and discussed by friedrich august von hayek 1899–1992 and milton friedman 1912–2006 who pleaded for a global free trade and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called neoliberalism however the prevailing view was that held by john maynard keynes 1883–1946 who argued for a stronger control of the markets by the state the theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called keynesianism in his honor in the late 1950s the economic growth in america and europe—often called wirtschaftswunder ger economic miracle —brought up a new form of economy mass consumption economy in 1958 john kenneth galbraith 1908–2006 was the first to speak of an affluent society in most of the countries the economic system is called a social market economy late 20th – beginning of 21st century with the fall of the iron curtain and the transition of the countries of the eastern block towards democratic government and market economies the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives at the place of the industrialization as well the first usage of this term some relate it to daniel bells 1973 book the coming of post-industrial society while other  to social philosopher ivan illichs book tools for conviviality the term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of postmodernism in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st century but the term came to common usage to describe the growth of economies like the chinese at the period the term is specifically used by bill clinton in a speech about republic of china in 1998 with the spread of internet as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000-2001 the idea for the internet and information economy is given place because of the growing importance of ecommerce and electronic businesses also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of all-connected society is created in the late 00s the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like china brazil and india bring attention and interest to different from the usually dominating western type economies and economic models economic phases of precedence the economy may be considered as having developed through the following phases or degrees of precedence the ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming the industrial revolution phase lessened the role of subsistence farming converting it to more extensive and mono-cultural forms of agriculture in the last three centuries the economic growth took place mostly in mining construction and manufacturing industries commerce became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community in the economies of modern consumer societies phase there is a growing part played by services finance and technology—the knowledge economy in modern economies these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the three-sector theory primary stagedegree of the economy involves the extraction and production of raw materials such as corn coal wood and iron a coal miner and a fisherman would be workers in the primary degree secondary stagedegree of the economy involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g manufacturing steel into cars or textiles into clothing a builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary degree at this stage the associated industrial economy is also sub-divided into several economic sectors also called industries their separate evolution during the industrial revolution phase is dealt with elsewhere tertiary stagedegree of the economy involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses such as baby-sitting cinema and banking a shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary degree quaternary stagedegree of the economy involves the research and development needed to produce products from natural resources and their subsequent by-products a logging company might research ways to use partially burnt wood to be processed so that the undamaged portions of it can be made into pulp for paper note that education is sometimes included in this sector other sectors of the developed community include  the public sector or state sector which usually includes parliament law-courts and government centers various emergency services public health shelters for impoverished and threatened people transport facilities airsea ports post-natal care hospitals schools libraries museums preserved historical buildings parksgardens nature-reserves some universities national sports groundsstadiums national artsconcert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions the private sector or privately run businesses the social sector or voluntary sector economic measures there are a number of ways to measure economic activity of a nation these methods of measuring economic activity include consumer spending exchange rate gross domestic product gdp per capita gnp stock market interest rate government debt rate of inflation unemployment balance of trade gdp the gdp  gross domestic product of a country is a measure of the size of its economy the most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the gdp and gdp per capita while often useful it should be noted that gdp only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged informal economy main article informal economy an informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government contrasted with a formal economy the informal economy is thus not included in that governments gross national product gnp although the informal economy is often associated with developing countries all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion informal economic activity is a dynamic process which includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange regulation and enforcement by its nature it is necessarily difficult to observe study define and measure no single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit of study the terms under the table and off the books typically refer to this type of economy the term black market refers to a specific subset of the informal economy the term informal sector was used in many
