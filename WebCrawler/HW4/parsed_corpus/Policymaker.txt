has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side in patronage-based systems such as the united states and canada in the 19th century winning politicians replace the bureaucracy with local politicians who formed their base of support the spoils system civil service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of government services that were involved however in many less

democracies first come the career politicians they are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement second are the political careerists these are politicians who gain reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts characteristics numerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians comparing those at the local and national levels and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections in recent years special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians for example there are studies of the supermadre model in latin american politics many politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents—it is an advantage in the job rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player united states presidents george w bush and bill clinton were renowned for their memories other studies show that politicians have simple brains lacking the complex personalities that other people display criticism many critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public areas of friction include the manner in which politicians speak which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to obscure mislead and confuse in the popular image politicians are thought of as clueless and corrupt taking money in exchange for goods or services rather than working for the general public good many ex-politicians who could not bear the leadership in politics that causes reprisals for critical thought criticize those who remain politicians for lacking critical thought see also american election campaigns in the 19th century midlothian campaign of 1878–1880 in britain
