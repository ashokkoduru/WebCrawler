convenience and necessity a contract carrier may be authorized to provide service over either fixed routes and schedules i.e as regular route carrier or on an ad hoc basis as an irregular route carrier it should be mentioned that the carrier refers only to the person legal or physical that enters into a contract of carriage with the shipper the carrier does not necessarily have to own or even be in the possession of a means of transport unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract the carrier may use whatever means of transport approved in its operating authority as long as it is the most favorable from the cargo interests point of view the carriers duty is to get the goods to the agreed destination within the agreed time or within reasonable time the person that is physically transporting the goods on a means of transport is referred to as the actual carrier when a carrier subcontracts with another provider such as an independent contractor or a third-party carrier the

but not this obligation from the former owner and must operate the line if service is terminated in contrast private carriers are not licensed to offer a service to the public private carriers generally provide transport on an irregular or ad hoc basis for their owners carriers were very common in rural areas prior to motorised transport regular services by horse-drawn vehicles would ply to local towns taking goods to market or bringing back purchases for the village if space permitted passengers could also travel telecommunications in the united states telecommunications carriers are regulated by the federal communications commission under title ii of the communications act of 1934 the telecommunications act of 1996 made extensive revisions to the title ii provisions regarding common carriers and repealed the judicial 1982 att consent decree often referred to as the modification of final judgment or mfj that effectuated the breakup of atts bell system further the act gives telephone companies the option of providing video programming on a common carrier basis or as a conventional cable television operator if it chooses the former the telephone company will face less regulation but will also have to comply with fcc regulations requiring what the act refers to as open video systems the act generally bars with certain exceptions including most rural areas acquisitions by telephone companies of more than a 10 percent interest in cable operators and vice versa and joint ventures between telephone companies and cable systems serving the same areas the fcc

other tariff terms imposed by interstate common carrier pipelines intrastate common carrier pipeline tariffs are often regulated by state agencies the us and many states have delegated the power of eminent domain to common carrier gas pipelines legal implications common carriers are subject to special laws and regulations that differ depending on the means of transport used e.g sea carriers are often governed by quite different rules from road carriers or railway carriers in common law jurisdictions as well as under international law a common carrier is absolutely liable for goods carried by it with four exceptions an act of nature an act of the public enemies fault or fraud by the shipper an inherent defect in the goods a sea carrier may also according to the hague-visby rules escape liability on other grounds than the above-mentioned e.g a sea carrier is not liable for damages to the goods if the damage is the result of a fire on board the ship or the result of a navigational error committed by the ships master or other crewmember carriers typically incorporate further exceptions into a contract of carriage often specifically claiming not to be a common carrier an important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that it cannot discriminate that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason as of 2007 the status of internet service providers as common carriers and their rights and responsibilities is widely debated network neutrality it is also important to remember that the term common carrier does not exist in continental europe but is distinctive to common law systems particularly law systems in the us in ludditt v ginger coote airways the privy council lord macmillan lord wright lord porter and lord simonds held the liability of a public or common carrier of passengers is only to carry with due care this is more limited than that of a common carrier of goods the complete freedom of a carrier of passengers at common law to make such contracts as he thinks fit was not curtailed by the railway and canal traffic act 1854 and a specific contract that enlarges diminishes or excludes his duty to take care e.g by a condition that the passenger travels at his own risk against all casualties cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable if the law authorises it there was nothing in the provisions of the canadian transport act 1938 section 25 that would invalidate a provision excluding liability grand trunk railway co of canada v robinson 1915 a.c 740 was followed and peek v north staffordshire
