biodiverse environment and a sustainable population size the charity holds the following policy positions population population growth increases damages to the environment and depletes natural resources therefore human numbers should be reduced voluntarily to a sustainable level that enables an acceptable quality of life for all given that human activity already exceeds earth’s capacity to support it population matters argues that population stabilisation should be strived for without delay the united nations projects that global population size could grow by 2.5 billion between 2015 and 2050 which illustrates the urgency of the matter further according to the organization development and climate change population growth increases the number of wealthy carbon emitters and poorer climate change victims and hampers mitigation and adaptation efforts in 2016 humanity used the sustainable resource output of 1.6 earths evidence has been presented that less equal affluent countries consume more resources and generate more waste than other affluent countries.·consequently population matters supports greater income equality developed countries are responsible for the majority of resource consumption as well as the associated global environmental degradation therefore the developed world has a responsibility to support developing nations according to the organization population matters supports the concept of contraction and convergence as conceived by the global commons institute women’s rights and reproductive health women’s empowerment and gender equality are essential for reproductive health economic development and population stabilization population matters therefore support programmes to improve the status of women population matters embraces the sustainable development goals that see women’s empowerment as a necessary condition for sustainable development comparisons made between developing nations that experienced rapid fertility decline and those that did not found that high fertility increases absolute levels of poverty by slowing economic growth and worsening the distribution of additionally acquired resources consequently the organization promotes policies improving access to contraceptive migration migration often results from conflict poverty inequality or population and consumption pressures population matters calls for fair trade terms and increased foreign aid and knowledge transfer to promote sustainable development global justice and resilience population matters believes that the only just and long-term solution to migration pressure is to address its underlying causes in the countries of origin such as poverty lack or over exploitation of resources climate change and conflict the organization believes that developed countries have a moral responsibility to help with this because they contribute to migratory pressures by being both major consumers of resources from developing countries and are the principle source of the causes of climate change ageing and parenthood population matters rejects the case that more young people are required to care for an increasing number of elderly it believes that governments should promote responsible parenthood and limit subsidies to the first two children unless a family is living in poverty population matters promotes the idea that society should deal with ageing by enabling employment for untrained underemployed and older people and by optimizing the use of technology activities population matters campaigns to stabilize population at a sustainable level through encouraging a culture shift towards smaller family sizes worldwide and improving resources for womens empowerment and family planning in lower income countries over the years the

material to help its supporters raise awareness of population growth the charity also runs popoffsets a project that offers members of the public the opportunity to offset their carbon emissions by donating towards family planning projects around the world population matters carries out research on climate change energy requirements biodiversity and other issues that relate to population numbers the resultant briefings are typically produced by student researchers and interns who work or volunteer for the organisation other activities include the population matters overshoot index which
