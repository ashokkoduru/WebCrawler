in economics a commodity is a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs often the item is fungible economic commodities comprise goods and services etymology the word commodity came into use in english in the 15th century from the french commodité amenity convenience going further back the french word derives from the latin commoditas meaning suitability convenience advantage the latin word commodus from which english gets other words including commodious and accommodate meant variously appropriate proper measure time or condition and advantage benefit types of commodity the term commodity is specifically used for an economic good or service when the demand for it has no qualitative differentiation across a market in other words a commodity good or service has full or partial but substantial fungibility that is the market treats its instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them as the saying goes from the taste of wheat it is not possible to tell who produced it a russian serf a french peasant or an english capitalist petroleum and copper are other examples of such commodities their supply and demand being a part of one universal market items such as stereo systems on the other hand have many aspects of product differentiation such as the brand the user interface and the perceived quality the demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another in contrast one of the characteristics of a commodity good is that its price is determined as a function of its market as a whole well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets generally these are basic resources and agricultural products such as iron ore sugar rice soft commodities are goods that are grown while hard commodities are ones that are extracted through mining there is another important class of energy commodities which includes electricity gas coal and oil electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store hence electricity must be consumed as soon as it is processed commoditization commoditization occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base often by the diffusion of the intellectual capital necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently as such goods that formerly carried premium margins for market participants have become commodities such as generic pharmaceuticals and dram chips an article in the new york times cites multivitamin supplements as an example of commoditization a 50 mg tablet of calcium is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it and as such multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation following this trend nanomaterials are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification there is a spectrum of commoditization rather than a binary distinction of commodity versus differentiable product few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation e.g fossil fuel wind solar in markets where energy choice lets a buyer opt and pay more for renewable methods if desired many products degree of commoditization depends on the buyers mentality and means for example milk eggs and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers for them the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice other customers take into consideration other factors besides price such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare to these customers distinctions such as organic versus not or cage free versus not count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs and percentage of recycled content or forest stewardship council certification count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper global commodities

in the original and simplified sense commodities were things of value of uniform quality that were produced in large quantities by many different producers the items from each different producer were considered equivalent on a commodity exchange it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity not any quality inherent in a specific producers product commodities

segments these markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find an equilibrium price and quantity in addition investors can gain passive exposure to the commodity markets through a commodity price index commodity as a new asset class for pension funds and swfs in order to further diversify their investments and mitigate the risks associated with inflationary debasement of currencies an increasing number of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are allocating more capital to non-listed assets such as a commodities and commodity-related infrastructure inventory data the inventory of commodities with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a stockout inventory exhaustion according to economist theorists companies receive a convenience yield by holding inventories of certain commodities data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source although data is available from various sources inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums commodification of labor see also labour is not a commodity in classical political economy and especially in karl marxs critique of political economy a commodity is an object or a good or service product or activity produced by human labour objects are external to man however some objects attain use value to persons in this world when they are found to be necessary useful or pleasant in life use value makes an object an object of human wants or is a means of subsistence in the widest sense as society developed people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services at this stage these goods and services became commodities commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are exchanged in a market in the marketplace where commodities are sold use value is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities accordingly in addition to having use value commodities must have an exchange value—a value that could be expressed in the market prior to marx many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value adam smith maintained that exchange value was made up of rent profit labour and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry david ricardo a follower of adam smith modified smiths approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service while maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity the other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour this unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production in capitalist society the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit the means of production means the site where the commodity is made the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity however not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market these priced goods are also treated as commodities e.g human labour-power works of art and natural resources earth itself is an instrument of labour even though they may not be produced specifically for the market or be non-reproducible goods marxs analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods using the labor theory of value this problem was extensively debated by adam smith david ricardo and karl rodbertus-jagetzow among others all three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100 of the exchange value of any commodity in varying degrees these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities marx held that the price and the value of a commodity were not synonymous price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time the value of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity prior to marx economists noted that the problem with using the quantity of labour to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker thus under this analysis the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker marx pointed out however that in society at large an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise this average time necessary to produce the commodity marx called the socially necessary labour time socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the exchange value of a given commodity value and price are not equivalent terms in economics and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and marxist economists however marx held that the value and price of any commodity would coincide only when demand and supply were equivalent to each other see also 2000s commodities boom cots commodification commodity marxism
