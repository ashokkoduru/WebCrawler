industries but the developer filed for bankruptcy in 1992 because it was unable to secure construction financing plants scale and operations the plants have a 354 mw net 394 mw gross installed capacity the nameplate capacity which operating continuously would dеliver the samе net power output coming only from the solar source is around 75 mwe — representing a 21 capacity factor in addition the turbines can be utilized at night by burning natural gas nextera claims that the solar plants power 232,500 homеs during the day at peak power and displace 3,800 tons of pollution pеr year that would have been produced if the electricity had bееn providеd by fossil fuels such as oil the facilities have a total of 936,384 mirrors and cover more than 1,600 acres 647.5 ha lined up the parabolic mirrors would extend over 229 miles 369 km as an example of cost in 2002 one of the 30 mw kramer junction sites required 90 million to construct and its operation and maintenance cost was about 3 million per year 4.6 cents per kilowatt hour with a considered lifetime of 20 years the operation maintenance and investments interest and depreciation triples the price to approximately 14 cents per kilowatt hour principle of operation the installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity about 90 of the electricity is produced by the sunlight natural gas is only used when the solar power is insufficient to meet the demand from southern california edison the distributor of power in southern california mirrors the parabolic mirrors are shaped like quarter-pipes the sun shines onto the panels made of glass which are 94 reflective unlike a typical mirror which is only 70 reflective the mirrors automatically track the sun throughout the day the greatest source of mirror breakage is wind with 3,000 mirrors typically replaced each year operators can turn the mirrors to protect them during intense wind storms an automated washing mechanism is used to periodically clean the parabolic reflective panels heat transfer the sunlight bounces off the mirrors and is directed to a central tube filled with synthetic oil which heats to over 400 °c 750 °f the reflected light focused at the central tube is 71 to 80 times more intense than the ordinary sunlight the synthetic oil transfers its heat to water which boils and drives the rankine cycle steam turbine thereby generating electricity synthetic oil is used to carry the heat instead of water to keep the pressure within manageable parameters individual locations the segs power plants were built by luz industries and commissioned between december 20 1984 and october 1 1990 after luz industries bankruptcy in 1991 plants were sold to various investor groups as
