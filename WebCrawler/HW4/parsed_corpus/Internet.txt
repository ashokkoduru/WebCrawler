other uses see internet disambiguation not to be confused with the world wide web the internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the internet protocol suite tcpip to link devices worldwide it is a network of networks that consists of private public academic business and government networks of local to global scope linked by a broad array of electronic wireless and optical networking technologies the internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the world wide web www electronic mail telephony and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing the origins of the internet date back to research commissioned by the united states federal government in the 1960s to build robust fault-tolerant communication via computer networks the primary precursor network the arpanet initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s the funding of the national science foundation network as a new backbone in the 1980s as well as private funding for other commercial extensions led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks the linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern internet and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional personal and mobile computers were connected to the network although the internet was widely used by academia since the 1980s the commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life internet use grew rapidly in the west from the mid-1990s and from the late 1990s in the developing world in the 20 years since 1995 internet use has grown 100-times measured for the period of one year to over one third of the world population most traditional communications media including telephony radio television paper mail and newspapers are being reshaped or redefined by the internet giving birth to new services such as email internet telephony internet television music digital newspapers and video streaming websites newspaper book and other print publishing are adapting to website technology or are reshaped into blogging web feeds and online news aggregators the entertainment industry was initially the fastest growing segment on the internet the internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging internet forums and social networking online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs as it enables firms to extend their bricks and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online business-to-business and financial services on the internet affect supply chains across entire industries the internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage each constituent network sets its own policies only the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the internet the internet protocol address space and the domain name system dns are directed by a maintainer organization the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann the technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the internet engineering task force ietf a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise terminology see also capitalization of internet the term internet when used to refer to the specific global system of interconnected internet protocol ip networks is a proper noun and may be written with an initial capital letter in common use and the media it is often not capitalized viz the internet some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun but not capitalized when used as an adjective the internet is also often referred to as the net as a short form of network historically as early as 1849 the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective meaning interconnected or interwoven the designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or internetworking meaning interconnecting computer networks the terms internet and world wide web are often used interchangeably in everyday speech it is common to speak of going on the internet when invoking a web browser to view web pages however the world wide web or the web is only one of a large number of internet services the web is a collection of interconnected documents web pages and other web resources linked by hyperlinks and urls as another point of comparison hypertext transfer protocol or http is the language used on the web for information transfer yet it is just one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the internet the term interweb is a portmanteau of internet and world wide web typically used sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user history main articles history of the internet and history of the world wide web research into packet switching started in the early 1960s and packet switched networks such as the arpanet cyclades the merit network npl network tymnet and telenet were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of protocols the arpanet project led to the development of protocols for internetworking by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks arpanet development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the network measurement center at the university of california los angeles ucla henry samueli school of engineering and applied science directed by leonard kleinrock and the nls system at sri international sri by douglas engelbart in menlo park california on 29 october 1969 the third site was the culler-fried interactive mathematics center at the university of california santa barbara followed by the university of utah graphics department in an early sign of future growth fifteen sites were connected to the young arpanet by the end of 1971 these early years were documented in the 1972 film computer networks the heralds of resource sharing early international collaborations on the arpanet were rare european developers were concerned with developing the x.25 networks notable exceptions were the norwegian seismic array norsar in june 1973 followed in 1973 by sweden with satellite links to the tanum earth station and peter t kirsteins research group in the united kingdom initially at the institute of computer science university of london and later at university college london in december 1974 rfc 675 specification of internet transmission control program by vinton cerf yogen dalal and carl sunshine used the term internet as a shorthand for internetworking and later rfcs repeated this use access to the arpanet was expanded in 1981 when the national science foundation nsf funded the computer science network csnet in 1982 the internet protocol suite tcpip was standardized which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks tcpip network access expanded again in 1986 when the national science foundation network nsfnet provided access to supercomputer sites in the united states for researchers first at speeds of 56 kbits and later at 1.5 mbits and 45 mbits commercial internet service providers isps emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s the arpanet was decommissioned in 1990 by 1995 the internet was fully commercialized in the u.s when the nsfnet was decommissioned removing the last restrictions on use of the internet to carry commercial traffic the internet rapidly expanded in europe and australia in the mid to late 1980s and to asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s the beginning of dedicated transatlantic communication between the nsfnet and networks in europe was established with a low-speed satellite relay between princeton university and stockholm sweden in december 1988 although other network protocols such as uucp had global reach well before this time this marked the beginning of the internet as an intercontinental network slightly over a year later in march 1990 the first high-speed t1 1.5 mbits link between the nsfnet and europe was installed between cornell university and cern allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites six months later tim berners-lee would begin writing worldwideweb the first web browser after two years of lobbying cern management by christmas 1990 berners-lee had built all the tools necessary for a working web the hypertext transfer protocol http 0.9 the hypertext markup language html the first web browser which was also a html editor and could access usenet newsgroups and ftp files the first http server software later known as cern httpd the first web server httpinfo.cern.ch and the first web pages that described the project itself public commercial use of the internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of mci mail and compuserves email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the internet just months later on january 1 1990 psinet launched an alternate internet backbone for commercial use one of the networks that would grow into the commercial internet we know today in 1991 the commercial internet exchange was founded allowing psinet to communicate with the other commercial networks cerfnet and alternet since 1995 the internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce including the rise of near instant communication by email instant messaging telephony voice over internet protocol or voip two-way interactive video calls and the world wide web with its discussion forums blogs social networking and online shopping sites increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-gbits 10-gbits or more the internet continues to grow driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge commerce entertainment and social networking during the late 1990s it was estimated that traffic on the public internet grew by 100 percent per year while the mean annual growth in the number of internet users was thought to be between 20 and 50 this growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration which allows organic growth of the network as well as the non-proprietary nature of the internet protocols which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network as of 31 march 2011 the estimated total number of internet users was 2.095 billion 30.2 of world population it is estimated that in 1993 the internet carried only 1 of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication by 2000 this figure had grown to 51 and by 2007 more than 97 of all telecommunicated information was carried over the internet governance main article internet governance the internet is a global network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks it operates without a central governing body the technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ipv4 and ipv6 is an activity of the internet engineering task force ietf a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise to maintain interoperability the principal name spaces of the internet are administered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann icann is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the internet technical business academic and other non-commercial communities icann coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the internet including domain names internet protocol ip addresses application port numbers in the transport protocols and many other parameters globally unified name spaces are essential

groups that are involved in developing and managing the internet including the internet engineering task force ietf internet architecture board iab internet engineering steering group iesg internet research task force irtf and internet research steering group irsg on 16 november 2005 the united nations-sponsored world summit on the information society in tunis established the internet governance forum igf to discuss internet-related issues infrastructure see also list of countries by number of internet users and list of countries by internet connection speeds the communications infrastructure of the internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture routing and service tiers internet service providers establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope end-users who only access the internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy at the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements tier 2 and lower level networks buy internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global internet though they may also engage in peering an isp may use a single upstream provider for connectivity or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple isps large organizations such as academic institutions large enterprises and governments may perform the same function as isps engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as geant gloriad internet2 and the uks national research and education network janet both the internet ip routing structure and hypertext links of the world wide web are examples of scale-free networks computers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct ip packets to the next-hop router or destination routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols end-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an isp providing transit while isp routers use the border gateway protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global internet access common methods of internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits broadband over coaxial cable fiber optics or copper wires wi-fi satellite and cellular telephone technology 3g 4g the internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and internet cafes internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops various terms are used such as public internet kiosk public access terminal and web payphone many hotels also have public terminals though these are usually fee-based these terminals are widely accessed for various usages such as ticket booking bank deposit or online payment wi-fi provides wireless access to the internet via local computer networks hotspots providing such access include wi-fi cafes where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or pda these services may be free to all free to customers only or fee-based grassroots efforts have led to wireless community networks commercial wi-fi services covering large city areas are in place in new york london vienna toronto san francisco philadelphia chicago and pittsburgh the internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench apart from wi-fi there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like ricochet various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks and fixed wireless services high-end mobile phones such as smartphones in general come with internet access through the phone network web browsers such as opera are available on these advanced handsets which can also run a wide variety of other internet software more mobile phones have internet access than pcs though this is not as widely used an internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online structure many computer scientists describe the internet as a prime example of a large-scale highly engineered yet highly complex system the structure was found to be highly robust to random failures yet very vulnerable to intentional attacks the internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively and the possibility of developing alternative structures has been investigated protocols while the hardware components in the internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success the responsibility for the architectural design of the internet software systems has been assumed by the internet engineering task force ietf the ietf conducts standard-setting work groups open to any individual about the various aspects of internet architecture resulting contributions and standards are published as request for comments rfc documents on the ietf web site the principal methods of networking that enable the internet are contained in specially designated rfcs that constitute the internet standards other less rigorous documents are simply informative experimental or historical or document the best current practices bcp when implementing internet technologies the internet standards describe a framework known as the internet protocol suite this is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols originally documented in rfc 1122 and rfc 1123 the layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate at the top is the application layer space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications for example a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm below this top layer the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and hosts via the physical connections the internet layer enables computers to identify and locate each other via internet protocol ip addresses and routes their traffic via intermediate transit networks last at the bottom of the architecture is the link layer which provides connectivity between hosts on the same network link such as a physical connection in the form of a local area network lan or a dial-up connection the model also known as tcpip is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware which the model therefore does not concern itself with in any detail other models have been developed such as the osi model that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications while many similarities exist between the models they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation indeed tcpip protocols are usually included in the discussion of osi networking the most prominent component of the internet model is the internet protocol ip which provides addressing systems ip addresses for computers on the internet ip enables internetworking and in essence establishes the internet itself internet protocol version 4 ipv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the internet and is still in dominant use it was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion 10 internet hosts however the explosive growth of the internet has led to ipv4 address exhaustion which entered its final stage in 2011 when the global address allocation pool was exhausted a new protocol version ipv6 was developed in the mid-1990s which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of internet traffic ipv6 is currently in growing deployment around the world since internet address registries rirs began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion ipv6 is not directly interoperable by design with ipv4 in essence it establishes a parallel version of the internet not directly accessible with ipv4 software thus translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the internet protocol network infrastructure however is still lagging in this development aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure the internet is facilitated by bi or multi-lateral commercial contracts e.g peering agreements and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network indeed the internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies services the internet carries many network services most prominently mobile apps such as social media apps the world wide web electronic mail multiplayer online games internet telephony and file sharing services world wide web many people use the terms internet and world wide web or just the web interchangeably but the two terms are not synonymous the world wide web is the primary application that billions of people use on the internet and it has changed their lives immeasurably however the internet provides many other services the web is a global set of documents images and other resources logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with uniform resource identifiers uris uris symbolically identify services servers and other databases and the documents and resources that they can provide hypertext transfer protocol http is the main access protocol of the world wide web web services also use http to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data world wide web browser software such as microsofts internet explorer mozilla firefox opera apples safari and google chrome lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents these documents may also contain any combination of computer data including graphics sounds text video multimedia and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page client-side software can include animations games office applications and scientific demonstrations through keyword-driven internet research using search engines like yahoo and google users worldwide have easy instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information compared to printed media books encyclopedias and traditional libraries the world wide web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale the web has also enabled individuals and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay publishing a web page a blog or building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available however publishing and maintaining large professional web sites with attractive diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition many individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries some commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information and be attracted to the corporation as a result one example of this practice is microsoft whose product developers publish their personal blogs in order to pique the publics interest in their work collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular and have become increasingly sophisticated whereas operations such as angelfire and geocities have existed since the early days of the web newer offerings from for example facebook and twitter currently have large followings these operations often brand themselves as social network services rather than simply as web page hosts advertising on popular web pages can be lucrative and e-commerce or the sale of products and services directly via the web continues to grow online advertising is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers it includes email marketing search engine marketing sem social media marketing many types of display advertising including web banner advertising and mobile advertising in 2011 internet advertising revenues in the united states surpassed those of cable television and nearly exceeded those of broadcast television many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation when the web developed in the 1990s a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server formatted in html complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request over time the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic creating a flexible design layout and content websites are often created using content management software with initially very little content contributors to these systems who may be paid staff members of an organization or the public fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in html form there may or may not be editorial approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors communication email is an important communications service available on the internet the concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the internet pictures documents and other files are sent as email attachments emails can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses internet telephony is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the internet voip stands for voice-over-internet protocol referring to the protocol that underlies all internet communication the idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers in recent years many voip systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone the benefit is that as the internet carries the voice traffic voip can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on internet connections such as cable or adsl voip is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available simple inexpensive voip network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer voice quality can still vary from call to call but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls remaining problems for voip include emergency telephone number dialing and reliability currently a few voip providers provide an emergency service but it is not universally available older traditional phones with no extra features may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure voip can never do so without a backup power source for the phone equipment and the internet access devices voip has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications as a form of communication between players popular voip clients for gaming include ventrilo and teamspeak modern video game consoles also offer voip chat features data transfer file sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the internet a computer file can be emailed to customers colleagues and friends as an attachment it can be uploaded to a website or file transfer protocol ftp server for easy download by others it can be put into a shared location or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues the load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of mirror servers or peer-to-peer networks in any of these cases access to the file may be controlled by user authentication the transit of the file over the internet may be obscured by encryption and money may change hands for access to the file the price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from for example a credit card whose details are also passed – usually fully encrypted – across the internet the origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by md5 or other message digests these simple features of the internet over a worldwide basis are changing the production sale and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission this includes all manner of print publications software products news music film video photography graphics and the other arts this in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products streaming media is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users many radio and television broadcasters provide internet feeds of their live audio and video productions they may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as preview classic clips and listen again features these providers have been joined by a range of pure internet broadcasters who never had on-air licenses this means that an internet-connected device such as a computer or something more specific can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver the range of available types of content is much wider from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services podcasting is a variation on this theme where – usually audio – material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move these techniques using simple equipment allow anybody with little censorship or licensing control to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth for example standard image quality needs 1 mbits link speed for sd 480p hd 720p quality requires 2.5 mbits and the top-of-the-line hdx quality needs 4.5 mbits for 1080p webcams are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon while some webcams can give full-frame-rate video the picture either is usually small or updates slowly internet users can watch animals around an african waterhole ships in the panama canal traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises live and in real time video chat rooms and video conferencing are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams with and without two-way sound youtube was founded on 15 february 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users it uses a flash-based web player to stream and show video files registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile youtube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily currently youtube also uses an html5 player social impact the internet has enabled new forms of social interaction activities and social associations this phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the internet users see also global internet usage and english on the internet internet usage has seen tremendous growth from 2000 to 2009 the number of internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion by 2010 22 percent of the worlds population had access to computers with 1 billion google searches every day 300 million internet users reading blogs and 2 billion videos viewed daily on youtube in 2014 the worlds internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population but two-thirds of the users came from richest countries with 78.0 percent of europe countries population using the internet followed by 57.4 percent of the americas the prevalent language for communication on the internet has been english this may be a result of the origin of the internet as well as the languages role as a lingua franca early computer systems were limited to the characters in the american standard code for information interchange ascii a subset of the latin alphabet after english 27 the most requested languages on the world wide web are chinese 25 spanish 8 japanese 5 portuguese and german 4 each arabic french and russian 3 each and korean 2 by region 42 of the worlds internet users are based in asia 24 in europe 14 in north america 10 in latin america and the caribbean taken together 6 in africa 3 in the middle east and 1 in australiaoceania the internets technologies have developed enough in recent years especially in the use of unicode that good facilities are available for development and communication in the worlds widely used languages however some glitches such as mojibake incorrect display of some languages characters still remain in an american study in 2005 the percentage of men using the internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women although this difference reversed in those under 30 men logged on more often spent more time online and were more likely to be broadband users whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate such as email men were more likely to use the internet to pay bills participate in auctions and for recreation such as downloading music and videos men and women were equally likely to use the internet for shopping and banking more recent studies indicate that in 2008 women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites such as facebook and myspace although the ratios varied with age in addition women watched more streaming content whereas men downloaded more in terms of blogs men were more likely to blog in the first place among those who blog men were more likely to have a professional blog whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog according to forecasts by euromonitor international 44 of the worlds population will be users of the internet by 2020 splitting by country in 2012 iceland norway sweden the netherlands and denmark had the highest internet penetration by the number of users with 93 or more of the population with access several neologisms exist that refer to internet users netizen as in as in citizen of the net refers to those actively involved in improving online communities the internet in general or surrounding political affairs and rights such as free speech internaut refers to operators or technically highly capable users of the internet digital citizen refers to a person using the internet in order to engage in society politics and government participation usage the internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections the internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means including through mobile internet devices mobile phones datacards handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the internet wirelessly within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices the services of the internet including email and the web may be available service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites examples range from cbeebies through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of google scholar for distance education help with homework and other assignments self-guided learning whiling away spare time or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere the internet in general and the world wide web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education further the internet allows universities in particular researchers from the social and behavioral sciences to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results the low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas knowledge and skills have made collaborative work dramatically easier with the help of collaborative software not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the internet allows such groups more easily to form an example of this is the free software movement which has produced among other things linux mozilla firefox and openoffice.org internet chat whether using an irc chat room an instant messaging system or a social networking website allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email these systems may allow files to be exchanged drawings and images to be shared or voice and video contact between team members content management systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each others work business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research software development conference planning political activism and creative writing social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both internet access and computer literacy spread the internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point access may be with computer security i.e authentication and encryption technologies depending on the requirements this is encouraging new ways of working from home collaboration and information sharing in many industries an accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by it specialists in a fourth these accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers in other remote locations based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the internet but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice an office worker away from their desk perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday can access their emails access their data using cloud computing or open a remote desktop session into their office pc using a secure virtual private network vpn connection on the internet this can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data including email and other applications while away from the office it has been referred to among system administrators as the virtual private nightmare because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees homes social networking and entertainment see also social networking service § social impact many people use the world wide web to access news weather and sports reports to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests people use chat messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals social networking websites such as facebook twitter and myspace have created new ways to socialize and interact users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages to pursue common interests and to connect with others it is also possible to find existing acquaintances to allow communication among existing groups of people sites like linkedin foster commercial and business connections youtube and flickr specialize in users videos and photographs while social networking sites were initially for individuals only today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands to market to their customers and to encourage posts to go viral black hat social media techniques are also employed by some organizations such as spam accounts and astroturfing a risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts especially public posts on social networking websites is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other internet users this is also a risk in relation to controversial offline behavior if it is widely made known the nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery through insults and hate speech to in extreme cases rape and death threats the online disinhibition effect describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person a significant number of feminist women have been the target of various forms of harassment in response to posts they have made on social media and twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse for organizations such a backlash can cause overall brand damage especially if reported by the media however this is not always the case as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others furthermore if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed that can then provoke a counter-backlash some websites such as reddit have rules forbidding the posting of personal information of individuals also known as doxxing due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified in particular the reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be censored in facebook screenshots posted to reddit however the interpretation of this rule in relation to public twitter posts is less clear and in any case like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each others attention to public social media posts they disagree with children also face dangers online such as cyberbullying and approaches by sexual predators who sometimes pose as children themselves children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate due to naivety they may also post personal information about themselves online which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so many parents choose to enable internet filtering andor supervise their childrens online activities in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the internet the most popular social networking websites such as facebook and twitter commonly forbid users under the age of 13 however these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway social networking sites for younger children which claim to provide better levels of protection for children also exist the internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception with entertaining social experiments such as muds and moos being conducted on university servers and humor-related usenet groups receiving much traffic today many internet forums have sections devoted to games and funny videos over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas the internet pornography and online gambling industries have taken advantage of the world wide web and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries use of the internet in general this has failed to stop their widespread popularity another area of leisure activity on the internet is multiplayer gaming this form of recreation creates communities where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games these range from mmorpg to first-person shooters from role-playing video games to online gambling while online gaming has been around since the 1970s modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as gamespy and mplayer non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games many people use the internet to access and download music movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists copyrights than others internet usage has been correlated to users loneliness lonely people tend to use the internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others such as in the i am lonely will anyone speak to me thread cybersectarianism is a new organizational form which involves highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts and often a common devotion to a particular leader overseas supporters provide funding and support domestic practitioners distribute tracts participate in acts of resistance and share information on the internal situation with outsiders collectively members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards in particular the british government has raised concerns about the prospect of young british muslims being indoctrinated into islamic extremism by material on the internet being persuaded to join terrorist groups such as the so-called islamic state and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to britain after fighting in syria or iraq cyberslacking can become a drain on corporate resources the average uk employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the web while at work according to a 2003 study by peninsula business services internet addiction disorder is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life psychologist nicolas carr believe that internet use has other effects on individuals for instance improving skills of scan-reading and interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity electronic business electronic business e-business encompasses business processes spanning the entire value chain purchasing supply chain management marketing sales customer service and business relationship e-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners according to international data corporation the size of worldwide e-commerce when global business-to-business and consumer transactions are combined equate to 16 trillion for 2013 a report by oxford economics adds those two together to estimate the total size of the digital economy at 20.4 trillion equivalent to roughly 13.8 of global sales while much has been written of the economic advantages of internet-enabled commerce there is also evidence that some aspects of the internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce economic inequality and the digital divide electronic commerce may be responsible for consolidation and the decline of mom-and-pop brick and mortar businesses resulting in increases in income inequality author andrew keen a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the internet has recently focused on the economic effects of consolidation from internet businesses keen cites a 2013 institute for local self-reliance report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every 10 million in sales while amazon employs only 14 similarly the 700-employee room rental start-up airbnb was valued at 10 billion in 2014 about half as much as hilton hotels which employs 152,000 people and car-sharing internet startup uber employs 1,000 full-time employees and is valued at 18.2 billion about the same valuation as avis and hertz combined which together employ almost 60,000 people telecommuting telecommuting is the performance within a traditional worker and employer relationship when it is facilitated by tools such as groupware virtual private networks conference calling videoconferencing and voice over ip voip so that work may be performed from any location most conveniently the workers home it can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances saving significant amounts of travel time and cost as broadband internet connections become commonplace more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks crowdsourcing the internet provides a particularly good venue for crowdsourcing because individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing collaborative publishing wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries in those settings they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing strategic planning departmental documentation and committee work the united states patent and trademark office uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications queens new york has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park the english wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the world wide web and ranks in the top 10 among all web sites in terms of traffic politics and political revolutions see also internet censorship culture of fear and mass surveillance the internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool the presidential campaign of howard dean in 2004 in the united states was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the internet many political groups use the internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission having given rise to internet activism most notably practiced by rebels in the arab spring the new york times suggested that social media websites such as facebook and twitter helped people organize the political revolutions in egypt by helping activists organize protests communicate grievances and disseminate information the potential of the internet as a civic tool of communicative power was explored by simon r b berdal in his 2004 thesis as the globally evolving internet provides ever new access points to virtual discourse forums it also promotes new civic relations and associations within which communicative power may flow and accumulate thus traditionally … national-embedded peripheries get entangled into greater international peripheries with stronger combined powers the internet as a consequence changes the topology of the centre-periphery model by stimulating conventional peripheries to interlink into super-periphery structures which enclose and besiege several centres at once berdal therefore extends the habermasian notion of the public sphere to the internet and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that interwoven internet technologies provide to limit the growing civic potential of the internet berdal also notes how self-protective measures are put in place by those threatened by it if we consider china’s attempts to filter unsuitable material from the internet most of us would agree that this resembles a self-protective measure by the system against the growing civic potentials of the internet nevertheless both types represent limitations to peripheral capacities thus the chinese government tries to prevent communicative power to build up and unleash as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising suggests the government may find it wise to install upstream measures even though limited the internet is proving to be an empowering tool also to the chinese periphery analysts believe that internet petitions have influenced policy implementation in favour of the public’s online-articulated will … incidents of politically motivated internet censorship have now been recorded in many countries including western democracies philanthropy the spread of low-cost internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals websites such as donorschoose and globalgiving allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice a popular twist on internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes kiva pioneered this concept in 2005 offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers lenders can contribute as little as 25 to loans of their choice and receive their money back as borrowers repay kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves however the recent spread of low-cost internet access in developing countries has made genuine international person-to-person philanthropy increasingly feasible in 2009 the us-based nonprofit zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries members can fund loans for as little as a dollar which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest borrowers access the internet via public cybercafes donated laptops in village schools and even smart phones then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses as they repay their loans borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages this direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs security main article internet security internet resources hardware and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions commit fraud engage in blackmail or access private information such attempts include computer viruses which copy with the help of humans computer worms which copy themselves automatically denial of service attacks ransomware botnets and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users usually these activities constitute cybercrime defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale surveillance main article computer and network surveillance see also signals intelligence and mass surveillance the vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the internet in the united states for example under the communications assistance for law enforcement act all phone calls and broadband internet traffic emails web traffic instant messaging etc are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network computers communicate over the internet by breaking up messages emails images videos web pages files etc into small chunks called packets which are routed through a network of computers until they reach their destination where they are assembled back into a complete message again packet capture appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network in order to examine their contents using other programs a packet capture is an information gathering tool but not an analysis tool that is it gathers messages but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for importantuseful information under the communications assistance for law enforcement act all u.s telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers broadband internet and voice over internet protocol voip traffic the large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information such as the use of certain words or phrases the access of certain types of web sites or communicating via email or chat with certain parties agencies such as the information awareness office nsa gchq and the fbi spend billions of dollars per year to develop purchase implement and operate systems for interception and analysis of data similar systems are operated by iranian secret police to identify and suppress dissidents the required hardware and software was allegedly installed by german siemens ag and finnish nokia censorship main articles internet censorship and internet freedom see also culture of fear some governments such as those of burma iran north korea the mainland china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates restrict access to content on the internet within their territories especially to political and religious content with domain name and keyword filters in norway denmark finland and sweden major internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities while this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites the content of the list is secret many countries including the united states have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material such as child pornography via the internet but do not mandate filter software many free or commercially available software programs called content-control software are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence performance as the internet is a heterogeneous network the physical characteristics including for example the data transfer rates of connections vary widely it exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization outages an internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signalling interruptions disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links land cables are also vulnerable as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of armenia internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of internet censorship as in the blockage of the internet in egypt whereby approximately 93 of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests energy use in 2011 researchers estimated the energy used by the internet to be between 170 and 307 gw less than two percent of the energy used by humanity this estimate included the energy needed to build operate and
