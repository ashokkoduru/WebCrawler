chain of a certain product is co-responsible for the conditions in which the product is made a brand selling clothes in europe is in part responsible for both the labour conditions at its suppliers and for example on the plantations and also for the environmental impact of that product in recent years the notion of supply chain responsibility has become increasingly accepted by individual companies as well as the fashion world in general focus garment and textile industry fwf restricts its focus to those phases of production where sewing is the main manufacturing process it is there that fwf believes it can have the greatest impact for workers this is among the most intensive phases of the production process it is the phase where very many labour problems are found and where effective remedies can positively impact the lives of millions of workers geographic reach as of 2012 fwf has some verification-related activity in the following countries bangladesh bulgaria china

an indication of an affiliated companies’ performance in upholding its fwf commitments complaints process the foundation has a worker and third-party complaints mechanism to address problems in a member companys supply chain fwf’s complaints procedure serves as a safety net fwf places complaints handlers in countries where fwf is active this ensures that workers making products for fwf affiliates can safely and fairly seek redress for violations of the fwf code verification of company management systems when a company joins fwf it commits to implement the fwf code of labour practices in its supply chain while this includes efforts to work directly with factories to improve conditions there it also means developing internal management systems to better support good

fwf publicly launched the fwf wage ladder an innovative new online tool which helps brands factories and labour groups make real progress towards living wages for garment and other workers based on a concept first developed by rutledge tufts as part of the jo-in project the fwf wage ladder allows the wages paid at any factory to be compared against a set of relevant local wage benchmarks which have been created by ngos labour groups business associations and government agencies the wage ladder generates a visual layout that shows where the wages paid across a factorys various departments are at in comparison to these benchmarks this provides a basis for negotiating improvements between factories brands and worker representatives fwf has made the tool publicly accessible in the interest of supporting better wages across the garment industry and beyond member companies eligible companies are those that operate in the european market – including producers distributors wholesalers and retailers garment and textile manufacturers can also join fwf as long as they operate in a producing country where fwf is active as of 2012 fwf has approximately 75 member companies

between 80 shops in amsterdam as part of its red ribbon campaign to raise consumer awareness about the companies that are working to improve workplace conditions through their membership in fwf funding sources financial support for the fwf comes from special social funds which were established as a result of sectoral collective bargaining in two sectors the garment sector and the retail sector between 2000 and 2008 fwf’s funding was divided fairly evenly 17-22 across the following sources member companies government ngos trade unions and business associations fwf has also received some support from the european union and funders such as un women history after nearly 5 years of multi-stakeholder negotiations fair wear foundation was founded in 1999 just as in other countries garment production in the netherlands had by then been displaced to low-wage countries after some years of campaigning against poor labour conditions in low-wage countries the union fnv and the ccc contacted the employers’ organisations and proposed a joint initiative to improve labour condition in the garment sector the founders designed the code of labour practices for the garment industry they based the code on the international standards included in international labour organization conventions with guidance from the model codes of the international clean clothes campaign and the icftu the international umbrella organisation of trade unions of which the fnv is a member in the period 1999–2002 the foundation carried out pilot projects on the implementation of the code of labour practices with four dutch companies these experiences led to the determination of a standard procedure building up membership among companies was the next step the first group of 11 members was announced to the public in march 2003 this group comprised partly fashion producers and partly producers of industrial workwear between 2003 and 2012 the company membership has grown nearly 700 see
