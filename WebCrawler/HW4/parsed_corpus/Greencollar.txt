trillion by 2020 with half of that market in efficient energy use in terms of energy supply the renewable energy industry will be particularly important some 2.3 million people have found renewable

of full life cycle emissions of nuclear hydro coal gas solar cell peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity the net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of produced power this compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal according to this study the study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of co2 of any of their electricity sources claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste a 2004 article from the bbc states the world health organization who says 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions and 1.6 million indoors through using solid fuel in the u.s alone fossil fuel waste kills 20,000 people each year a coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage it is estimated that during 1982 us coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the three mile island incident in addition fossil fuel waste causes global warming which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes flooding and other weather events the world nuclear association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production in their comparison deaths per tw-yr of electricity produced from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower 342 for coal 85 for natural gas and 8 for nuclear other uses green collar is used in the metal gear franchise to refer
