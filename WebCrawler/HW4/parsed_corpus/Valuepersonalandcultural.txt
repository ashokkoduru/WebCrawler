values redirects here for other uses see values disambiguation in ethics value denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live deontology or to describe the significance of different actions axiology it may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects putting value to them it deals with right conduct and good life in the sense that a highly or at least relatively highly valuable action may be regarded as ethically good adjective sense and an action of low in value or somewhat relatively low in value may be regarded as bad what makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethic values of the objects it increases decreases or alters an object with ethic value may be termed an ethic or philosophic good noun sense values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes as such values reflect a persons sense of right and wrong or what ought to be equal rights for all excellence deserves admiration and people should be treated with respect and dignity are representative of values values tend to influence attitudes and behavior types of values include ethicalmoral values doctrinalideological religious political values social values and aesthetic values it is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined such as altruism are intrinsic and whether some such as acquisitiveness should be classified as vices or virtues study ethical value may be regarded as a study under ethics which in turn may be grouped as philosophy similar to that ethics may be regarded as a subfield of philosophy ethical value may be regarded as a subgroup of the more broad and vague philosophic value ethical value denotes somethings degree importance with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions it may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects putting value to them it deals with right conduct and good life in the sense that a highly or at least relatively highly valuable action or may be regarded as good and an action of low or at least relatively low value may be regarded as bad the study of ethical value is also included in value theory in addition values have been studied in various disciplines anthropology behavioral economics business ethics corporate governance moral philosophy political sciences social psychology sociology and theology similar concepts ethical value is sometimes used synonymously with goodness however goodness has many other meanings as well and may be regarded as more ambiguous personal versus cultural perspectives personal values exist in relation to cultural values either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms a culture is a social system that shares a set of common values in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good beautiful and constructive without normative personal values there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate personal values personal values provide an internal reference for what is good beneficial important useful beautiful desirable and constructive values generate behaviour and influence the choices made by an individual values may help solve common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them moral religious and personal values when held rigidly may also give rise to conflicts that result from a clash between differing world views over time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives lay the foundations of law custom and tradition recent research has thereby stressed the implicit nature of value communication cultural values individual cultures emphasize values which their members broadly share one can often identify the values of a society by noting which people receive honor or respect in the united states of america for example professional athletes at the top levels in some sports receive more honor measured in terms of monetary payment than university professors surveys show that voters in the united states would not willingly elect an atheist as president suggesting belief in a god as a generally shared value values clarification differs from cognitive moral education value clarification consists of helping people clarify what their lives are for and what is worth working for it encourages students to define their own values and to understand others values cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like democracy and justice as their moral reasoning develops values relate to the norms of a culture but they are more global and abstract than norms norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations while values identify what should be judged as good or evil while norms are standards patterns rules and guides of expected behavior values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm but it reflects the value of patriotism wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest respect at a funeral different cultures reflect values differently and to different levels of emphasis over the last three decades traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others values seemed to have changed affecting the beliefs and attitudes of the students members take part in a culture even if each members personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture this reflects an individuals ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple subcultures they belong to if a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the groups norms the groups authority may carry out various ways of encouraging conformity or stigmatizing the non-conforming behavior of that member for example imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law furthermore institutions in the global economy can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a triangle of coherence in the first instance a value may come to expression within the world trade organization wto as well as in the second instance within the united nations  particularly in the educational scientific and cultural organization unesco  providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability in the third instance the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules to preserve the expression of identity in a globalized world nonetheless in warlike economic competition differing views may contradict each other particularly in the field of culture thus audiences in europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment while audiences in the united states may see it as mere entertainment whatever its artistic merits eu policies based on the notion of cultural exception can become juxtaposed with the policy of cultural specificity on the liberal anglo-saxon side indeed international law traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service consequently cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the anglo-saxon liberal position causing failures in international negotiations transmission values are generally received through cultural means especially transmission from parents to children parents in different cultures have different values for example parents in a hunterâ€“gatherer society or surviving through subsistence agriculture value practical survival skills from a young age many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools including knives before their first birthdays italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament spanish parents want their children to be sociable swedish parents value security and happiness dutch parents value independence long attention spans and predictable schedules american parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability especially in a narrow book learning sense the kipsigis people of kenya value children who are not only smart but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way which they call ngom luos of kenya value education and pride which they call nyadhi the reception of values can be regarded as a part of socialization properties and forms relative or absolute relative values differ between people and on a larger scale between people of different cultures on the other hand there are theories of the existence of absolute values which can also be termed noumenal values and not to be confused with mathematical absolute value an absolute value can be described as philosophically absolute and independent of individual and cultural views as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not ludwig wittgenstein was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects we can speak as much as we want about life and its meaning and believe that what we say is important but these are no more than expressions and can never be facts resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will intrinsic or extrinsic philosophic value may be split into instrumental value and intrinsic values an instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good e.g a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music an intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself not as a means to something else it is giving value intrinsic and extrinsic properties an ethic good with instrumental value may be termed an ethic mean and an ethic good with intrinsic value may be termed an end-in-itself an object may be both a mean and end-in-itself summation intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories some objects are both good in themselves and also good for getting other objects that are good understanding science may be such a good being both worthwhile in and of itself and as a means of achieving other goods in these cases the sum of instrumental specifically the all instrumental value and instrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in value systems which is a set of consistent values and measures intensity the intensity of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good the object having the value it should not be confused with the amount of value per object although the latter may vary too e.g because of instrumental value conditionality for example taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten and is zero when no waffles are eaten e.g if no waffles are present still each waffle that had been present would still have value no matter if it was being eaten or not independent on intensity instrumental value conditionality in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible in many life stances it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable i.e not only to generate value but to generate it in large degree maximizing lifestances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative homology in physics when comparing to the homologous measure in physics then intensity in physics may not be the best example but may better be described as its area in this sense power in physics may be compared to the amount of value per object and physical intensity the product of value per object and ethic intensity if there is no physical area then no energy is generated regardless of physical power in the same way if there is no ethic intensity then no total value is generated regardless of value per object positive and negative value there may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value while positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized negative value may be both intrinsic negative value andor instrumental negative value protected value a protected value also sacred value is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be for example some people may be unwilling to kill another person even if it means saving many others individuals protected values tend to be intrinsically good and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary if such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called tragic trade-offs protected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts e.g the israeli-palestinian conflict because they can hinder businesslike utilitarian negotiations from the perspective of utilitarianism protected values are biases when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals according to jonathan baron and mark spranca protected values arise from norms as described in theories of deontological ethics the latter often being referred to in context with immanuel kant the protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it value system a value system is a set of consistent values used for the purpose of ethical or ideological integrity consistency as a member of a society group or community an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time in this case the two value systems one personal and one communal are externally consistent provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them a value system in its own right is internally consistent when its values do not contradict each other and its exceptions are or could be abstract enough to be used in all situations and consistently applied conversely a value system by itself is internally inconsistent if its values contradict each other and its exceptions are highly situational and inconsistently applied value exceptions abstract exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations situational exceptions on the other hand are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations the presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems an idealized value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions it is therefore absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions other than the default are called absolutists a realized value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances this type is what people tend to use in daily life the difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it thus holding a different value system for example a religion lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions implicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a formal value system whether idealized or realized this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value as long as no higher-priority value is violated for instance a person might feel that lying is wrong since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong lying to save someoneâ€™s life is acceptable perhaps too simplistic in practice such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions conflict although sharing a set of common values like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit two different parties might not rank those values equally also two parties might disagree as to certain actions are right or wrong both in theory and in practice and find themselves in an ideological or physical conflict ethonomics the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems enables us to understand politics and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts an example conflict would be a value system based on individualism pitted against a value system based on collectivism a rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below note that added exceptions can become recursive and often convoluted individuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others freedom or with functions of society that individuals need provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals a society or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society the functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society a society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society the failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed a society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values this means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values economic and philosophic value further information value economics philosophical value is distinguished from economic value since it is independent on some other desired condition or commodity the economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity e.g money become high in supply and vice versa when supply of money becomes low nevertheless economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value in the subjective theory of value the personal philosophic value a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it the limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the personal philosophic value of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it e.g money in this light everything can be said to have a personal economic value in contrast to its societal economic value see also attitude psychology clyde kluckhohn and his
