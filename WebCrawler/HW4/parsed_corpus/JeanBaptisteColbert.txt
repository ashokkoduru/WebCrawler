louis xiv his relentless hard work and thrift made him an esteemed minister he achieved a reputation for his work of improving the state of french manufacturing and bringing the economy back from the brink of bankruptcy historians note that despite colberts efforts france actually became increasingly impoverished because of the kings excessive spending on wars colbert worked to create a favourable balance of trade and increase frances colonial holdings colberts market reforms included the foundation of the manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs in 1665 to supplant the importation of venetian glass forbidden in 1672 as soon as the french glass manufacturing industry was on sound footing and to encourage the technical expertise of flemish cloth manufacturing in france he also founded royal tapestry works at gobelins and supported those at beauvais colbert worked to develop the domestic economy by raising tariffs and by encouraging major public works projects colbert also worked to ensure that the french east india company had access to foreign markets so that they could always obtain coffee cotton dyewoods fur pepper and sugar in addition colbert founded the french merchant marine colbert issued more than 150 edicts to regulate the guilds one such law had the intention of improving the quality of cloth the edict declared that if the authorities found a merchants cloth unsatisfactory on three separate occasions they were to tie him to a post with the cloth attached to him he created the seigneurial system biography colberts father and grandfather operated as merchants in his birthplace of reims france he claimed to have scottish ancestry a general but unconfirmed belief exists that he spent his early youth at a jesuit college working for a parisian banker as well as working for the father of jean chapelain before the age of 20 colbert had a post in the war office a position generally attributed to the marriage of an uncle to the sister of secretary of war michel le tellier colbert spent some time as an inspector of troops eventually becoming the personal secretary of le tellier in 1647 through unknown means colbert acquired the confiscated goods of an uncle pussort in 1648 he and his wife marie charron received 40,000 crowns from an unknown source and in 1649 colbert became the councillor of state political minister in 1657 he purchased the barony of seignelay the death of mazarin and colberts rise colbert was recommended to king louis xiv by mazarin while cardinal mazarin was in exile louis trust in colbert grew in 1652 colbert was asked to manage the affairs of the cardinal while he was away this new responsibility would detach colbert from his other responsibility as commissaire des guerres although colbert was not a supporter of mazarin in principle he would defend the cardinals interests with unflagging devotion colberts earliest recorded attempt at tax reform came in the form of a mémoire to mazarin showing that of the taxes paid by the people not one-half reached the king the paper also contained an attack upon the superintendent fouquet the postmaster of paris a spy of fouquets read the letter leading to a dispute which mazarin attempted to suppress in 1661 mazarin died and colbert made sure of the kings favour by revealing the location of some of mazarins hidden wealth in january 1664 colbert became the superintendent of buildings in 1665 he became controller-general of finances in 1669 he became secretary of state of the navy he also gained appointments as minister of commerce of the colonies and of the palace in short colbert acquired power in every department except that of war a great financial and fiscal reform at once claimed all his energies not only the nobility but many others who had no legal claim to exemption paid no taxes the bulk of the burden fell on the wretched country-folk supported by the young king louis xiv colbert aimed the first blow at the man accused of being the greatest of the royal embezzlers the superintendent nicolas fouquet fouquets fall simultaneously secured colberts own advancement economic reform with the abolition of the office of superintendent and of many other offices dependent upon it the supreme control of the finances became vested in a royal council the sovereign functioned as its president but colbert though for four years he possessed the title only of intendant operated as its ruling spirit having had great personal authority conferred upon him by the king one must not judge the career on which colbert now entered without remembering the corruption of the previous financial administration his ruthlessness in this case dangerous precedent though it gave seemed perhaps necessary the council could not respect individual interests when he had severely punished guilty officials he turned his attention to the fraudulent creditors of the government colbert had a simple method of operation he repudiated some of the public loans and cut off from others a percentage which varied at first according to his own decision and afterwards according to that of the council that he established to examine all claims against the state much more serious difficulties met his attempts to introduce equality in the pressure of the taxes on the various classes to diminish the number of the privileged proved impossible but colbert firmly resisted false claims for exemption and lightened the unjust direct taxation by increasing the indirect taxes from which the privileged could not escape at the same time he immensely improved the mode of collection on his own colbertism further information colbertism and protectionism having thus introduced a measure of order and economy into the workings of the government colbert now called for the enrichment of the country by commerce the state through colberts dirigiste policies fostered manufacturing enterprises in a wide variety of fields the authorities established new industries protected inventors invited in workmen from foreign countries and prohibited french workmen from emigrating to maintain the character of french goods in foreign markets as well as to afford a guarantee to the home consumer colbert had the quality and measure of each article fixed by law punishing breaches of the regulations by public exposure of the delinquent and by destruction of the goods concerned and on the third offense by the pillory colbert prohibited the production of qualities which would have suited many purposes of consumption and the odious supervision which became necessary involved great waste of time and a stereotyped regularity which resisted all improvements other parts of colberts schemes have met with less equivocal condemnation by his firm maintenance of the corporation system each industry remained in the hands of certain privileged bourgeois while the lower classes found opportunities of advancement closed he did however wisely consult the interests of internal commerce unable to abolish the duties on the passage of goods from province to province he did what he could to induce the provinces to equalise them currency exchange rates still remained between these provinces despite a policy focusing on the unification of french trade his régime improved roads and canals pierre paul riquet 1604–1680 planned and constructed the canal du midi under colberts patronage to encourage overseas trade with the levant senegal guinea and other places colbert granted privileges to companies but like the noted french east india company all proved unsuccessful religion colbert played a subordinate role in the struggle between the king and the papacy as to the royal rights over vacant bishoprics and he seems to have sympathised with the proposal that suggested seizing part of the wealth of the clergy in his hatred of idleness he ventured to suppress no less than seventeen fêtes and he had a project for reducing the number of persons devoted to clerical and monastic life by increasing the age for taking the vows he showed himself at first unwilling to interfere with heresy for he realised the commercial value of the huguenots french protestants who were well represented among the merchant classes but when the king resolved to make all france roman catholic he followed him and urged his subordinates to do all that they could to promote conversions cultural matters colbert took much interest in art and literature he possessed a remarkably fine private library which he delighted to fill with valuable manuscripts from every part of europe and the near east where france had placed a consul he employed pierre de carcavi and Étienne baluze as librarians colberts grandson sold the manuscript collection in 1732 to the bibliothèque royale colbert founded a number of institutions in 1663 the academy of inscriptions and medals in 1666 the academy of sciences now part of the institut de france in 1667 the paris observatory which he employed claude perrault to build and brought giovanni domenico cassini 1625–1712 from italy to superintend in 1671 the academy of architecture the academy of music the french academy at rome and academies at arles soissons nîmes and many other towns he reorganised the academy of painting and sculpture which mazarin had established wishing to increase the prestige of the image of france and the french royal family colbert played an active role in bringing the great italian architect-sculptor gian lorenzo bernini to paris june–october 1665 in order to design the new east facade of the louvre and sculpt a marble portrait bust of louis xiv this was quite an international diplomatic-artistic coup because bernini who had never left rome or its vicinity was personal architect to the pope whom louis was attempting to humiliate however the relations between the two strong-willed men colbert and bernini proved melodramatically stormy and colbert ultimately rejected berninis louvre design though the italian artists bust of the king housed today in the versailles palace won louiss appreciation colbert himself became a member of the académie française and proposed one very characteristic rule with the intention of expediting the great dictionary in which he had a great interest no one could count as present at any meeting unless he arrived before the hour of commencement and remained till the hour for leaving in 1673 colbert presided over the first exhibition of the works of living painters and he enriched the louvre with hundreds of pictures and statues he gave many pensions to men of letters among whom we find molière corneille racine boileau p d huet 1630–1721 and antoine varillas 1626–1696 and even foreigners as huygens carlo dati the dellacruscan evidence exists to show that by this munificence he hoped to draw out praises of his sovereign and himself but this motive certainly does not account for all the splendid if in some cases specious services that he rendered to literature science and art death 1683 colbert worked incessantly hard until his final hours work was his religion he once pondered whether it was better to rise early and work or retire very late and work he concluded that rising early and retiring late would be the ideal combination towards the end of his life he suffered from stomach aches which caused him much distress he was reduced to eating moist bread dipped in chicken broth for his meals by 64 he was bedridden and died shortly after his birthday the surgeons who examined him found that he had been suffering from kidney stones a huge stone was found in his urinary tract which would explain his pain legacy of his children jean-baptiste colbert marquis de seignelay followed his father as secretary of state of the navy while jacques-nicolas colbert was archbishop of rouen his policies inspired those of alexander hamilton the first treasury secretary of the united states six ships of the french navy bore his name a steam corvette in 1848 a battleship in 1875 a cargo ship in 1914 a dundee in 1916 a french heavy cruiser launched 1928 a french missile cruiser launched 1956 in literature the power struggle between colbert and fouquet is one of the main plotlines of alexandre dumas pères novel the vicomte of bragelonne the second sequel to the three musketeers dumas paints colbert as an uncouth and ruthless schemer who stops at little in contrast to the more refined fouquet counselled by aramis quotes it is simply and solely the abundance of money within a state which makes the difference in its grandeur and power the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing see also kingdom of
