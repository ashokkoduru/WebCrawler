the eugene green energy standard was an international standard to which national or international green electricity labelling schemes could be accredited to confirm that they provide genuine environmental benefits it was designed to encourage the generation and use of additional renewable energy sources for electricity generation although the limited use of additional natural gas-fired cogeneration plant was also supported initially funded in part through the eus clean-e programme but also including some participants from outside europe the eugene standard was formally discontinued after february 2009 dismantling on 2 february 2009 eugene’s general assembly voted in favour of its dismantling it was agreed that the members and board would continue to work together to promote green energy in europe but that the eugene standard and the association asbl under belgian law would cease to exist the standard the standard confirmed that energy supplied under the accredited schemes is produced from genuinely sustainable energy sources will result in a real increase in renewable generation beyond the requirements imposed by government additionality that the demand from consumers is matched by renewable generation two variations of the standard gold and silver differentiated between schemes depending on the additionality of new renewable energy supplied the development of the standard was aided by the european unions clean-e initiative during 2005 and 2006 accredited energy labels national energy labels formerly accredited by eugene included the organisation also recommends certain other national schemes that are progressing towards accreditation including there was no eugene accredited scheme in the united kingdom the uks energy regulator ofgem published guidelines in february 2009 that broadly followed the eugene standard requiring matching and additionality through carbon savings although allowing the latter to be met through energy efficiency or offsetting as well as through new renewables schemes these were implemented in february 2010 in the uks green energy supply certification scheme the eugene standard had also been adopted in chile while a pilot scheme is in progress in france the eugene network the standard was managed by the eugene network formerly the european green electricity network an international membership-based non-profit organization the network aimed to coordinate and harmonise green energy labelling nationally and internationally promote the adoption of the eugene standard as the basis for national and international green energy markets and encourage consumers and suppliers to choose credible green energy products formal discussions on the eugene standard first took place in 2000 led by the world wide fund for nature and it was officially launched on june 24 2002 the eugene network was legally established in 2003 and the first national energy labels were accredited in 2004 full voting membership of the network was open to citizen organisations pursuing not for profit activities with the objectives of promoting green electricity but with no direct interests in the generation and supply of energy services organisations outside this scope but which do have a commitment and interest in creating a viable green energy market were able to become non-voting associate members or supporters as of june 2007 the members of the eugene network were see also energy portal ekoenergy electricity retailing energy conservation energy policy energy quality environmental concerns with electricity generation global warming iso 14001 low-carbon economy ren21 external links greenlabelspurchase.net eugene present and future development of bra miljöval-labelled electricity 2005-02-14 additionality in renewable energy association for environment conscious building the green electricity illusion eugene standard entry at ecolabelling.org january 1 2007 leonardo energy green power labels not yet at full power october 2 2002 world wildlife fund green electricity that really is green
