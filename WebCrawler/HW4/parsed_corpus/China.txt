used in early hindu scripture including the mahābhārata 5th century bc and the laws of manu 2nd century bc the traditional theory proposed in the 17th century by martino martini and supported by many later scholars is that the word china and its earlier related forms are ultimately derived from the state of qin 秦 old chinese dzin the westernmost of the chinese states during the zhou dynasty which unified china to form the qin dynasty there are however other suggestions for the derivation of china the official name of the modern state is the peoples republic of china chinese 中华人民共和国 pinyin

dynasty was the xia which emerged around 2100 bc the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 1959 it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th century bc their oracle bone script from c. 1500 bc represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese characters the shang were conquered by the zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries bc though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year spring and autumn period only occasionally deferring to the zhou king by

currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and northern vietnam the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperors death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burned the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206 bc and ad 220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese the han expanded the empires territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world despite the hans initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin

khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice
