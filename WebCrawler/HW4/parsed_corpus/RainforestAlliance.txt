rainforest alliance fairtrade lite offering companies such as chiquita and kraft a way to tap into the ethical consumer market alex nicholls professor of social entrepreneurship at oxford university called rainforest alliance certification a less expensive way for companies to answer consumers’ concerns about sustainability than to achieve fair trade certification however in a comparison of the fair trade and rainforest alliance certification systems by the international trade center the rainforest alliance ranks as more rigorous in nearly every category according to a 2012 study rainforest alliance certified cocoa farms in côte divoire produced 40 percent more cocoa per acre than noncertified farms net income on certified farms also increased by 400 this was achieved not through price premiums but through increased yields due to healthier lands and improved farm management in a 2012 comparison of certified and noncertified coffee farms in colombia certified farms had significantly higher rates of protective-equipment usage for chemical applications specialized warehouses dedicated to chemical storage employee training in first aid and pesticide application septic-tank use and solid-waste collection in a survey of rainforest alliance certified coffee farms in nicaragua farmers reported that since earning certification in 2004 the combination of fewer chemicals and a better quality of life had led to improved overall health and that their workers now had better shower and toilet facilities a 2013 report by cenicafe an independent colombian coffee research institution found evidence that rainforest alliance certification has a positive effect on the environment in and around farms minimum price issues rainforest alliance sustainable agriculture certification like the certification schemes utz certified and organic does not offer producers minimum or guaranteed price therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations as an example in the 1980s a pound of standard-grade coffee sold for around us 1.20 in 2003 a pound sold for about 0.50 which was not enough to cover the costs of production in much of the world the price of coffee has since rebounded somewhat with prices for arabica reaching 1.18pound by the end of 2007 it should be noted however that fair trade’s minimum pricing requirements have come under criticism as well notably for lack of evidence that fair trade farmers actually receive higher prices the rainforest alliance counters that a system that focuses primarily on pricing misses out on a number of other critical elements that influence whether or not a farmer can transcend poverty and sustain future generations on the land for example price-based systems depend on the willingness of customers to pay premiums for certified products but this approach is of little use to farmers who cannot reach such buyers others including utz another certification system have argued that price minimums distort the market which is an important force in scaling up good practices maximizing yields and protecting the long-term health of the land are critical to the economic sustainability of any certification system although many rainforest alliance certified farms do in fact achieve price premiums for high-quality product rainforest alliance focuses on improving the entire spectrum of farming practices third-party studies have shown the organization’s approach to be effective in raising both income and net revenue for farmers michigan state university professor of sociology daniel jaffee has criticized rainforest alliance certification claiming that its standards are arguably far lower than fair trades and saying they establish minimum housing and sanitary conditions but do not stipulate a minimum price for coffee critically they require plantation owners only to pay laborers the national minimum wage a notoriously inadequate standard the economist favors the rainforest alliances method and notes that guaranteeing a minimum price as fairtrade does means there is no incentive to improve quality they also note that coffee drinkers say the quality of fairtrade brews varies widely the rainforest alliance does things differently it does not guarantee a minimum price or offer a premium but provides training advice that consumers are often willing to pay more for a product with the rainforest alliance logo on it is an added bonus not the result of a formal subsidy scheme such products must still fend for themselves in the marketplace minimum price programs which ensure that farmers receive no less than a given predetermined amount regardless of the commodity price have been criticized by some economists as artificially manipulating markets and counter-intuitively limiting the impact of minimum price goods by making them too expensive for some consumers to afford use of seal the organization certification has been criticized for allowing the use of the seal on products containing a minimum of 30 of certified content according to michael conroy former chairman of the board for fair trade usa this use of the seal is the most damaging dimension of rainforest alliances agricultural certification program and a serious blow to the integrity of certification consumer reports counters conroys implication that the rainforest alliance certified seal is misleading consumer reports classifies the rainforest alliance certified seal on agricultural products as somewhat meaningful the rainforest alliance responds that a greater positive impact on the ground can be made by engaging with companies of all sizes and offering 30 as an entry point a large company that agrees to source at 30 can have a greater scale of impact due to higher product volume e.g 30 of 1,000 tons is substantially more than 100 of 100 tons the entry point is also intended to address limited availability of certain products since in some cases years of work are required to train and certify enough farms to meet a large companys commodity needs the organization requires companies to increase quantities of certified ingredients as more product becomes available and maintains a database detailing these commitments the organization also requires companies to clearly disclose the percentage of rainforest alliance certified content if it is less than 90 a criticism that has arisen regarding the rainforest alliance certification is that brands are allowed to use the green frog seal on a product if even just 30 percent of the product comes from rainforest alliance certified farms ray says however that 30 percent certified content from a multinational brand still has a significant impact.mother earth news what does “rainforest alliance certified” mean 5212009 see also sustainable
