for the engineering college in lucknow india see institute of engineering and technology the institution of engineering and technology iet is the largest multidisciplinary professional engineering institution in the world the iet was formed in 2006 from two separate institutions the institution of electrical engineers iee dating back to 1871 and the institution of incorporated engineers iie dating back to 1884 its worldwide membership is currently in excess of 167,000 the iets main offices are in savoy place in london england and at michael faraday house in stevenage england the iet has the authority to establish professional registration for the titles of chartered engineer incorporated engineer engineering technician and ict technician as a licensed member institution of the engineering council the iet is registered as a charity in england and wales and in scotland formation discussions started in 2004 between the iee and the iie about merging to form a new institution in september 2005 both institutions held votes of the merger and the members voted in favour 73.5 iee 95.7 iie this merger also needed government approval so a petition was then made to the privy council of the united kingdom for a supplemental charter to allow the creation of the new institution this was approved by the privy council on december 14 2005 and the new institution emerged on march 31 2006 history of the iee the society of telegraph engineers ste was formed on may 17 1871 and it published the journal of the society of telegraph engineers from 1872 through 1880 on december 22 1880 the ste was renamed as the society of telegraph engineers and of electricians and as part of this change it renamed its journal the journal of the society of telegraph engineers and of electricians 1881 – 82 and later the journal of the society of telegraph-engineers and electricians 1883 – 88 following a meeting of its council on 10 november 1887 it was decided to adopt the name of the institution of electrical engineers iee the name of the institution of electrical engineers remains engraved in the marble façade of its headquarters at savoy place as part of this change its journal was renamed journal of the institution of electrical engineers in 1889 and it kept this title through 1963 in 1921 the institution was incorporated by royal charter and following mergers with the institution of electronic and radio engineers iere in 1988 and the institution of manufacturing engineers imfge in 1990 it had a worldwide membership of around 120,000 the iee represented the engineering profession operated professional networks worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests had an educational role including the accreditation of degree courses and operated schemes to provide awards scholarships grants and prizes it was well known for publication of the iee wiring regulations which now continue to be written by the iet and to be published by the british standards institution as bs 7671 the iet hosts the archive for the womens engineering society wes and it has also provided office space for wes since 2005 history of the iie the modern institution of incorporated engineers iie traced its heritage to the vulcanic society that was founded in 1884 and became the junior institution of engineers in 1902 which became the institution of general technician engineers in 1970 it changed its name in 1976 to the institution of mechanical and general technician engineers at this point it merged with the institution of technician engineers in mechanical engineering and formed the institution of mechanical incorporated engineers in 1988 the institution of engineers in charge which was founded in 1895 was merged into the institution of mechanical incorporated engineers imechie in 1990 the institution of electrical and electronic technician engineers the society of electronic and radio technicians and the institute of practitioners in radio and electronics merged in 1990 to form the institution of electronics and electrical incorporated engineers ieeie the iie was formed in april 1998 by the merger of the institution of electronic and electrical incorporated engineers ieeie the institution of mechanical incorporated engineers imechie and the institute of engineers and technicians iet not to be confused with the later-formed institution of engineering and technology in 1999 there was a further merger with the institution of incorporated executive engineers iiexe the iie had a worldwide membership of approximately 40,000 journals the iet has a journals publishing program totalling 24 titles such as iet software as of march 2012 with the addition of iet biometrics and iet networks the journals contain both original and review-oriented papers relating to various disciplines in electrical electronics computing control biomedical and communications technologies electronics letters is a
