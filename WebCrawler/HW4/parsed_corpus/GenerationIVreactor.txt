generation iv reactors gen iv are a set of nuclear reactor designs currently being researched for commercial applications by the generation iv international forum with technology readiness levels varying between the level requiring a demonstration to economical competitive implementation they are motivated by a variety of goals including improved safety sustainability efficiency and cost most of these designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030–40 presently the majority of reactors in operation around the world are considered second generation reactor systems as the vast majority of the first-generation systems were retired some time ago and there are only a dozen or so generation iii reactors in operation 2014 generation v reactors refer to reactors that are purely theoretical and are therefore not yet considered feasible in the short term resulting in limited rd funding history the generation iv international forum gif is a co-operative international endeavour which was set up to carry out the research and development needed to establish the feasibility and performance capabilities of the next generation nuclear energy systems it was founded in 2001 there are currently ten active members of the generation iv international forum gif canada china the european atomic energy community euratom france japan russia south africa south korea switzerland and the united states the non-active members are argentina brazil and the united kingdom switzerland joined in 2002 euratom in 2003 and china and russia in 2006 the remaining countries excluding australia were founding members the 36th gif meeting in brussels was held in november 2013 the technology roadmap update for generation iv nuclear energy systems was published in january 2014 which details rd objectives for the next decade a breakdown of the reactor designs being researched by each forum member has been made available australia joined the forum in 2016 reactor types many reactor types were considered initially however the list was downsized to focus on the most promising technologies and those that could most likely meet the goals of the gen iv initiative three systems are nominally thermal reactors and three are fast reactors the very high temperature reactor vhtr is also being researched for potentially providing high quality process heat for hydrogen production the fast reactors offer the possibility of burning actinides to further reduce waste and of being able to breed more fuel than they consume these systems offer significant advances in sustainability safety and reliability economics proliferation resistance depending on perspective and physical protection thermal reactors a thermal reactor is a nuclear reactor that uses slow or thermal neutrons a neutron moderator is used to slow the neutrons emitted by fission to make them more likely to be captured by the fuel very-high-temperature reactor vhtr main article very high temperature reactor see also fort st vrain generating station httr and htr-10 the very high temperature reactor concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle using helium or molten salt as the coolant this reactor design envisions an outlet temperature of 1,000 °c the reactor core can be either a prismatic-block or a pebble bed reactor design the high temperatures enable applications such as process heat or hydrogen production via the thermochemical iodine-sulfur process it would also be passively safe the planned construction of the first vhtr the south african pbmr pebble bed modular reactor lost government funding in february 2010 a pronounced increase of costs and concerns about possible unexpected technical problems had discouraged potential investors and customers the peoples republic of china began construction of a 200-mw high temperature pebble bed reactor in 2012 as a successor to its htr-10 also in 2012 as part of the next generation nuclear plant competition idaho national laboratory approved a design similar to arevas prismatic block antares reactor as the chosen htgr to be deployed as a prototype by 2021 it was in competition with general atomics gas turbine modular helium reactor and westinghouses pebble bed modular reactor molten-salt reactor msr main article molten salt reactor see also liquid fluoride thorium reactor a molten salt reactor is a type of nuclear reactor where the primary coolant or even the fuel itself is a molten salt mixture there have been many designs put forward for this type of reactor and a few prototypes built the early concepts and many current ones rely on nuclear fuel dissolved in the molten fluoride salt as uranium tetrafluoride uf4 or thorium tetrafluoride thf4 the fluid would reach criticality by flowing into a graphite core which would also serve as the moderator many current concepts rely on fuel that is dispersed in a graphite matrix with the molten salt providing low pressure high temperature cooling the gen iv msr is more accurately termed an epithermal reactor than a thermal reactor due to the average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within its fuel being faster than thermal neutrons the principle of a msr can be used for thermal epithermal and fast reactors since 2005 the focus has moved towards a fast spectrum msr msfr while most msr designs being pursued are largely derived from the 1960s molten-salt reactor experimentmsre variants of molten salt technology include the conceptual dual fluid reactor which is being designed with lead as a cooling medium but molten salt fuel commonly as the metal chloride e.g plutoniumiii chloride to aid in greater nuclear waste closed-fuel cycle capabilities other notable approaches differing substantially from those with msre pedigree include the stable salt reactorssr concept promoted by moltex which encases the molten salt in hundreds of the common solid fuel rods that are already well established in the nuclear industry this latter british design was found to be the most competitive for small modular reactor development by a british based consultancy firm energy process development in 2015 supercritical-water-cooled reactor scwr main article supercritical water reactor the supercritical water reactor scwr is a reduced moderation water reactor concept that due to the average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within the fuel being faster than thermal neutrons it is more accurately termed an epithermal reactor than a thermal reactor it uses supercritical water as the working fluid scwrs are basically light water reactors lwr operating at higher pressure and temperatures with a direct once-through heat exchange cycle as most commonly envisioned it would operate on a direct cycle much like a boiling water reactor bwr but since it uses supercritical water not to be confused with critical mass as the working fluid it would have only one water phase present which makes the supercritical heat exchange method more similar to a pressurized water reactor pwr it could operate at much higher temperatures than both current pwrs and bwrs supercritical water-cooled reactors scwrs are promising advanced nuclear systems because of their high thermal efficiency i.e about 45 vs about 33 efficiency for current lwrs and considerable plant simplification the main mission of the scwr is generation of low-cost electricity it is built upon two proven technologies lwrs which are the most commonly deployed power generating reactors in the world and superheated fossil fuel fired boilers a large number of which are also in use around the world the scwr concept is being investigated by 32 organizations in 13 countries a scwr design under development is the vver-1700393 vver-scwr or vver-skd — a russian supercritical-water-cooled reactor with double-inlet-core and a breeding ratio of 0.95 fast reactors a fast reactor directly uses the fast neutrons emitted by fission without moderation unlike thermal neutron reactors fast neutron reactors can be configured to burn or fission all actinides and given enough time therefore drastically reduce the actinides fraction in spent nuclear fuel produced by the present world fleet of thermal neutron light water reactors thus closing the nuclear fuel cycle alternatively if configured differently they can also breed more actinide fuel than they consume gas-cooled fast reactor gfr main article gas-cooled fast reactor the gas-cooled fast reactor gfr system features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium and management of actinides the reactor is helium-cooled and with an outlet temperature of 850 °c it is an evolution of the very-high-temperature reactor vhtr to a more sustainable fuel cycle it will use a direct brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products composite ceramic fuel advanced fuel particles or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds core configurations are being considered based on pin or plate-based fuel assemblies or prismatic blocks the european sustainable nuclear industrial initiative is funding three generation iv reactor systems one of which is a gas-cooled fast reactor called allegro 100 mwt which will be built in a central or eastern european country with construction expected to begin in 2018 the central european visegrád group are committed to pursuing the technology in 2013 german british and french institutes finished a 3-year collaboration study on the follow on industrial scale design known as gofastr they were funded by the eus 7th fwp framework programme with the goal of making a sustainable vhtr sodium-cooled fast reactor sfr main article sodium-cooled fast reactor see also experimental breeder reactor ii s-prism bn-800 reactor and toshiba 4s the sfr is a project that builds on two closely related existing projects the liquid metal fast breeder reactor and the integral fast reactor the goals are to increase the efficiency of uranium usage by breeding plutonium and eliminating the need for transuranic isotopes ever to leave the site the reactor design uses an unmoderated core running on fast neutrons designed to allow any transuranic isotope to be consumed and in some cases used as fuel in addition to the benefits of removing the long half-life transuranics from the waste cycle the sfr fuel expands when the reactor overheats and the chain reaction automatically slows down in this manner it is passively safe the sfr reactor concept is cooled by liquid sodium and fueled by a metallic alloy of uranium and plutonium or spent nuclear fuel the nuclear waste of light water reactors the sfr fuel is contained in steel cladding with liquid sodium filling in the space between the clad elements which make up the fuel assembly one of the design challenges of an sfr is the risks of handling sodium which reacts explosively if it comes into contact with water however the use of liquid metal instead of water as coolant allows the system to work at atmospheric pressure reducing the risk of leakage the european sustainable nuclear industrial initiative is funding three generation iv reactor systems one of which is a sodium-cooled fast reactor called astrid advanced sodium technical reactor for industrial demonstration areva cea and edf are leading the design with british collaboration astrid will be rated about 600 mwe and is proposed to be built in france near to the phénix reactor a final decision in construction is to be made in 2019 the prcs first commercial-scale 800 mwe fast neutron reactor to be situated near sanming in fujian province will be a sfr in 2009 an agreement was signed that would entail the russian bn-800 reactor design to be sold to the prc once it is completed this would be the first time commercial-scale fast neutron reactors have ever been exported the bn-800 reactor became operational in 2014 in india the prototype fast breeder reactor a 500 mwe sodium cooled fast reactor is being built at a cost of inr 5,677 crores ~us900 million and is expected to be commissioned by september 2016 the pfbr will be followed by six more commercial fast breeder reactors cfbrs of 500 mwe each the 400 mwe fast flux test facility operated successfully for ten years at the hanford site in washington state the 20 mwe ebr ii operated successfully for over thirty years at the idaho national laboratory until it was shut down in 1994 lead-cooled fast reactor lfr main article lead-cooled fast reactor see also myrrha the lead-cooled fast reactor features a fast-neutron-spectrum lead or leadbismuth eutectic lbe liquid-metal-cooled reactor with a closed fuel cycle options include a range of plant ratings including a battery of 50 to 150 mw of electricity that features a very long refueling interval a modular system rated at 300 to 400 mw and a large monolithic plant option at 1,200 mw the term battery refers to the long-life factory-fabricated core not to any provision for electrochemical energy conversion the fuel is metal or nitride-based containing fertile uranium and transuranics the lfr is cooled by natural convection with a reactor outlet coolant temperature of 550 °c possibly ranging up to 800 °c with advanced materials the higher temperature enables the production of hydrogen by thermochemical processes the european sustainable nuclear industrial initiative is funding three generation iv reactor systems one of which is a lead-cooled fast reactor that is also an accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor called myrrha 100 mwt which will be built in belgium with construction expected to begin after 2014 and the industrial scale version known as alfred slated to be constructed sometime after 2017 a reduced-power model of myrrha called guinevere was started up at mol in march 2009 in 2012 the research team reported that guinevere was operational two other lead-cooled fast reactors under development are the svbr-100 a modular 100 mwe lead-bismuth cooled fast neutron reactor concept designed by okb gidropress in russia and the brest-od-300 lead-cooled fast reactor 300 mwe to be developed after the svbr-100 and built over 2016-20 it will dispense with the fertile blanket around the core and will supersede the sodium cooled bn-600 reactor design to purportedly give enhanced proliferation resistance advantages and disadvantages relative to current nuclear power plant technology the claimed benefits for 4th generation reactors include nuclear waste that remains radioactive for a few centuries instead of millennia 100-300 times more energy yield from the same amount of nuclear fuel broader range of fuels and even unencapsulated raw fuels non-pebble msr lftr in some reactors the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity that is a closed nuclear fuel cycle this strengthens the argument to deem nuclear power as renewable energy improved operating safety features such as depending on design avoidance of pressurized operation automatic passive unpowered uncommanded reactor shutdown avoidance of water cooling and the associated risks of loss of water leaks or boiling and hydrogen generationexplosion and contamination of coolant water nuclear reactors do not emit co2 during operation although like all low carbon power sources the mining and construction phase can result in co2 emissions if energy sources which are not carbon neutral such as fossil fuels or co2 emitting cements are used during the construction process a 2012 yale university review published in the journal of industrial ecology analyzing co2 life cycle assessment lca emissions from nuclear power determined that the collective lca literature indicates that life cycle ghg greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies although the paper primarily dealt with data from generation ii reactors and did not analyze the co2 emissions by 2050 of the presently under construction generation iii reactors it did summarize the life cycle assessment findings of in development reactor technologies fbrs fast breeder reactors have been evaluated in the lca literature the limited literature that evaluates this potential future technology reports median life cycle ghg emissions similar to or lower than lwrs gen ii light water reactors and purports to consume little or no uranium ore a specific risk of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is related to using metallic sodium as a coolant in case of a breach sodium explosively reacts with water fixing breaches may also prove dangerous as the cheapest noble gas argon is also used to prevent sodium oxidation argon like helium can displace oxygen in the air and can pose hypoxia concerns so workers may be exposed to this additional risk this is a pertinent problem as can be testified by the events at the loop type prototype fast breeder reactor monju at tsuruga japan using lead or molten salts mitigates this problem by making the coolant less reactive and allowing a high freezing temperature and low pressure in case of a leak disadvantages of lead compared to sodium are much higher viscosity much higher density lower heat capacity and more radioactive neutron activation products in many cases there is already a large amount of experience built up with numerous proof of concept gen iv designs for example the reactors at fort st vrain generating station and htr-10 are similar to the proposed gen iv vhtr designs and the pool type ebr-ii phénix and bn-600 reactor are similar to the proposed pool type gen iv sodium cooled fast reactors being designed see also nuclear reactor nuclear material
