for other uses see system disambiguation a system is a set of interacting or interdependent component parts forming a complexintricate whole every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries surrounded and influenced by its environment described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning the term system may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure or behavior alternatively and usually in the context of complex social systems the term is used to describe the set of rules that govern structure or behavior etymology the term system comes from the latin word systēma in turn from greek σύστημα systēma whole compounded of several parts or members system literary composition history according to marshall mcluhan system means something to look at you must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization in philosophy before descartes there was no system plato had no system aristotle had no system in the 19th century the french physicist nicolas léonard sadi carnot who studied thermodynamics pioneered the development of the concept of a system in the natural sciences in 1824 he studied the system which he called the working substance typically a body of water vapor in steam engines in regards to the systems ability to do work when heat is applied to it the working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler a cold reservoir a stream of cold water or a piston to which the working body could do work by pushing on it in 1850 the german physicist rudolf clausius generalized this picture to include the concept of the surroundings and began to use the term working body when referring to the system the biologist ludwig von bertalanffy 1901-1972 became one of the pioneers of the general systems theory in 1945 he introduced models principles and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses irrespective of their particular kind the nature of their component elements and the relation or forces between them norbert wiener 1894-1964 and ross ashby 1903-1972 who pioneered the use of mathematics to study systems carried out significant development in the concept of a system in the 1980s john h holland 1929  murray gell-mann 1929 and others coined the term complex adaptive system at the interdisciplinary santa fe institute system concepts analysis of systems evidently there are many types of systems that can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively for example with an analysis of urban systems dynamics a.w steiss defines five intersecting systems including the physical subsystem and behavioral system for sociological models influenced by systems theory where kenneth d bailey defines systems in terms of conceptual concrete and abstract systems either isolated closed or open walter f buckley defines social systems in sociology in terms of mechanical organic and process models bela h banathy cautions that with any inquiry into a system that understanding the type of system is crucial and defines natural and designed systems systems that are purposed by man inherently have a major flaw they must have a starting assumptions in which this starting assumptions is used to build further knowledge upon this starting assumptions is not inherently bad but it is used as the foundation of the system and as it is assumed to be true and not definitively so then the system is not as structurally sound as perceived to be for example in geometry a subsystem of math this is highly evident when one goes through the process of taking theorems and extrapolates proofs from those set theorems in offering these more global definitions the author maintains that it is important not to confuse one for the other the theorist explains that natural systems include sub-atomic systems living systems the solar system the galactic system and the universe designed systems are our creations our physical structures hybrid systems which include natural and designed systems and our conceptual knowledge the human element of organization and activities are emphasized with their relevant abstract systems and representations a key consideration in making distinctions among various types of systems is to determine how much freedom the system has to select purpose goals methods tools etc and how widely is the freedom to select itself distributed or concentrated in the system george j klir maintains that no classification is complete and perfect for all purposes and defines systems in terms of abstract real and conceptual physical systems bounded and unbounded systems discrete to continuous pulse to hybrid systems etc the interaction between systems and their environments are categorized in terms of relatively closed and open systems it seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or if it did that it could be known by us important distinctions have also been made between hard and soft systems hard systems are technical in nature and amenable to methods such as systems engineering operations research and quantitative systems analysis soft systems involve people and organisations and are commonly associated with concepts developed by peter checkland and brian wilson through soft systems methodology ssm involving methods such as action research and emphasizing participatory designs where hard systems might be identified as more scientific the distinction between them is actually often hard to define cultural system a cultural system may be defined as the interaction of different elements of culture while a cultural system is quite different from a social system sometimes both systems together are referred to as the sociocultural system a major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order economic system main article economic system an economic system is a mechanism social institution which deals with the production distribution and consumption of goods and services in a particular society the economic system is composed of people institutions and their relationships to resources such as the convention of property it addresses the problems of economics like the allocation and scarcity of resources application of the system concept systems modeling is generally a basic principle in engineering and in social sciences the system is the representation of the entities under concern hence inclusion to or exclusion from system context is dependent of the intention of the modeler no model of a system will include all features of the real system of concern and no model of a system must include all entities belonging to a real system of concern systems in information and computer science in computer science and information science system is a software system which has components as its structure and observable inter-process communications as its behavior again an example will illustrate there are systems of counting as with roman numerals and various systems for filing papers or catalogues and various library systems of which the dewey decimal system is an example this still fits with the definition of components which are connected together in this case in order to facilitate the flow of information system can also be used referring to a framework be it software or hardware designed to allow software programs to run see platform systems in engineering and physics in engineering and physics a physical system is the portion of the universe that is being studied of which a thermodynamic system is one major example engineering also has the concept of a system that refers to all of the parts and interactions between parts of a complex project systems engineering refers to the branch of engineering that studies how this type of system should be planned designed implemented built and maintained systems in social and cognitive sciences and management research social and cognitive sciences recognize systems in human person models and in human societies they include human brain functions and human mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and socialcultural behavioral patterns in management science operations research and organizational development od human organizations are viewed as systems conceptual systems of interacting components such as subsystems or system aggregates which are carriers of numerous complex business processes organizational behaviors and organizational structures organizational development theorist peter senge developed the notion of organizations as systems in his book the fifth discipline systems thinking is a style of thinkingreasoning and problem solving it starts from the recognition of system properties in a given problem it can be a leadership competency some people can think globally while acting locally such people consider the potential consequences of their decisions on other parts of larger systems this is also a basis of systemic coaching in psychology organizational theorists such as margaret wheatley have also described the workings of organizational systems in new metaphoric contexts such as quantum physics chaos theory and the self-organization of systems pure logical systems there is also such a thing as a logical system the most obvious example is the calculus developed simultaneously by leibniz and isaac newton another example is george booles boolean operators other examples have related specifically to philosophy biology or cognitive science maslows hierarchy of needs applies psychology to biology by using pure logic numerous psychologists including carl jung and sigmund freud have developed systems which logically organize psychological domains such as personalities motivations or intellect and desire often these domains consist of general categories following a corollary such as a theorem logic has been applied to categories such as taxonomy ontology assessment and hierarchies systems applied to strategic thinking in 1988 military strategist john a warden iii introduced the five ring system model in his book the air campaign contending that any complex system could be broken down into five concentric rings each ring—leadership processes infrastructure population and action units—could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change the model was used effectively by air force planners in the first gulf war in the late 1990s warden applied his model to business strategy see also bibliography alexander backlund 2000 the definition of system in kybernetes vol 29 nr 4 pp. 444–451 kenneth d bailey 1994 sociology and the new systems
