expectancy in demography  however the term longevity is sometimes meant to refer only to especially long-lived members of a population whereas life expectancy is always defined statistically as the average number of years remaining at a given age for example a populations life expectancy at birth is the same as the average age at death for all people born in the same year in the case of cohorts longevity is best thought of as a term for general audiences meaning typical length of life and specific statistical definitions should be clarified when necessary reflections on longevity have usually gone beyond acknowledging the brevity of human life and have included thinking about methods to extend life longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel science fiction and utopian novels there are many difficulties in authenticating the longest human life span ever by modern verification standards owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics fiction legend and folklore have proposed or claimed life spans in the past or future vastly longer than those verified by modern standards and longevity narratives and unverified longevity claims frequently speak of their existence in the present a life annuity is a form of longevity insurance life expectancy as of 2010 main article list of countries by life expectancy various

modern times and the oldest american jiroemon kimura 1897–2013 116 years 54 days the oldest man in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation major factors evidence-based studies indicate that longevity is based on two major factors genetics and lifestyle choices genetics twin studies have estimated that approximately 20-30 the variation in human lifespan can be related to genetics with the rest due to individual behaviors and environmental factors which can be modified although over 200 gene variants have been associated with longevity according to a us-belgian-uk research database of human genetic variants these explain only a small fraction of the heritability a 2012 study found that even modest amounts of leisure time physical exercise can extend life expectancy by as much as 4.5 years lymphoblastoid cell lines established from blood samples of centenarians have significantly higher activity of the dna repair protein parp poly adp ribose polymerase than cell lines from younger 20 to 70 year old individuals the lymphocytic cells of centenarians have characteristics typical of cells from young people both in their capability of priming the mechanism of repair after h2o2 sublethal oxidative dna damage and in their parp gene expression these findings suggest that elevated parp gene expression contributes to the longevity of centenarians consistent with the dna damage theory of aging environmental factors a study of the regions of the world known as blue zones where people commonly live active lives past 100 years of age speculated that longevity is related to a healthy social and family life not smoking eating a plant-based diet frequent consumption of legumes and nuts and engaging in regular physical activity in a cohort study the combination of a plant based diet normal bmi and not smoking accounted for differences up to 15 years in life expectancy korean court records going back to 1392 indicate that the average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years which was 14.4–19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar socio-economic status the alameda county study hypothesized three additional lifestyle characteristics that promote longevity limiting alcohol consumption sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night and not snacking eating between meals although the study found the association between these characteristics and mortality is weak at best there are however many other possible factors potentially affecting longevity including the impact of high peer competition which is typically experienced in large cities change over time in preindustrial times deaths at young and middle age were more common than they are today this is not due to genetics but because of environmental factors such as disease accidents and malnutrition especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th century medicine deaths from childbirth were common in women and many children did not live past infancy in addition most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems despite this we do find many examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining lifespans of 75 years or greater including benjamin franklin thomas jefferson john adams cato the elder thomas hobbes eric of pomerania christopher polhem and michelangelo this was also true for poorer people like peasants or laborers genealogists will almost certainly find ancestors living to their 70s 80s and even 90s several hundred years ago for example an 1871 census in the uk the first of its kind but personal data from other censuses dates back to 1841 and numerical data back to 1801 found the average male life expectancy as being 44 but if infant mortality is subtracted males who lived to adulthood averaged 75 years the present male life expectancy in the uk is 77 years for males and 81 for females while the united states averages 74 for males and 80 for females studies have shown that black american males have the shortest lifespans of any group of people in the us averaging only 69 years asian-american females average the longest this reflects overall poorer health and greater prevalence of heart disease obesity diabetes and cancer among black american men women normally outlive men and this was as true in pre-industrial times as today theories for this include smaller bodies and thus less stress on the heart a stronger immune system since testosterone acts as an immunosuppressant and less tendency to engage in physically dangerous activities there is a current debate as to whether or not the pursuit of longevity is a worthwhile health care goal for the united states bioethicist ezekiel emanuel who is also one of the architects of obamacare has stated that the pursuit of longevity via the compression of morbidity explanation is a fantasy and that life is not worth living after age 75 therefore longevity should not be a goal of health care policy this has been refuted by neurosurgeon miguel faria who states that life can be worthwhile in healthy old age that the compression of morbidity is a real phenomenon that longevity should be pursued in association with quality of life faria has discussed how longevity in association with leading healthy lifestyles can lead to the postponement of senescence as well as happiness and wisdom in old age limited longevity all of the biological organisms have a limited longevity and different species’ of animals and plants have different potentials of longevity misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that the potential of longevity of an organism is related to its structural complexity limited longevity is due to the limited structural complexity of the organism if a species of organisms has too high structural complexity most of its individuals would die before the reproduction age and the species could not survive this theory suggests that limited structural complexity and limited longevity are essential for the survival of a species longevity traditions main articles longevity traditions and longevity claims longevity traditions are traditions about long-lived people generally supercentenarians and practices that have been believed to confer longevity a comparison and contrast of longevity in antiquity such as the sumerian king list the genealogies of genesis and the persian shahnameh with longevity in historical times common-era cases through twentieth-century news reports is elaborated in detail in lucian boias 2004 book forever young a cultural history of longevity from antiquity to the present and other sources the fountain of youth reputedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks of its waters the new testament following older jewish tradition attributes healing to the pool of bethesda when the waters are stirred by an angel after the death of juan ponce de león gonzalo fernández de oviedo y valdés wrote in historia general y natural de las indias 1535 that ponce de león was looking for the waters of bimini to cure his aging traditions that have been believed to confer greater human longevity also include alchemy such as that attributed to nicolas flamel in the modern era the okinawa diet has some reputation of linkage to exceptionally high ages more recent longevity claims are subcategorized by many editions of guinness world records into four groups in late life very old people often tend to advance their ages at the rate of about 17 years per decade  several celebrated super-centenarians over 110 years are believed to have been double lives father and son relations with the same names or successive bearers of a title  a number of instances have been commercially sponsored while a fourth category of recent claims are those made for political ends  the estimate of 17 years per decade was corroborated by the 1901 and 1911 british censuses mazess and forman also discovered in 1978 that inhabitants of vilcabamba ecuador claimed excessive longevity by using their fathers and grandfathers baptismal entries time magazine considered that by the soviet union longevity had been elevated to a state-supported methuselah cult robert ripley regularly reported supercentenarian claims in ripleys believe it or not usually citing his own reputation as a fact-checker to claim reliability future the u.s census bureau view on the future of longevity is that life expectancy in the united states will be in the mid-80s by 2050 up from 77.85 in 2006 and will top out eventually in the low 90s barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today the census bureau also predicted that the united states would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100 the united nations has also made projections far out into the future up to 2300 at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising though more and more slowly than before these projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300 in some cases by as much as 20 years the un itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine technology and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries the un has warned that these projections are uncertain and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections recent increases in the rates of lifestyle diseases such as obesity diabetes hypertension and heart disease may eventually slow or reverse this trend toward increasing life expectancy in the developed world but have not yet done so the average age of the us population is getting higher and these diseases show up in older people jennifer couzin-frankel examined how much mortality from various causes would have to drop in order to boost life expectancy and concluded that most of the past increases in life expectancy occurred because of improved survival rates for young people she states that it seems unlikely that life expectancy at birth will ever exceed 85 years michio kaku argues that genetic engineering nanotechnology and future breakthroughs will accelerate the rate of life expectancy increase indefinitely already genetic engineering has allowed the life expectancy of certain primates to be doubled and for human skin cells in labs to divide and live indefinitely without becoming cancerous however since 1840 record life expectancy has risen linearly for men and women albeit more slowly for men for women the increase has been almost three months per year for men almost 2.7 months per year in light of steady increase without any sign of limitation the suggestion that life expectancy will top out must be treated with caution scientists oeppen and vaupel observe that experts who assert that life expectancy is approaching a ceiling  have repeatedly been proven wrong it is thought that life expectancy for women has increased more dramatically owing to the considerable advances in medicine related to childbirth mice have been genetically engineered to live twice as long as ordinary mice drugs such as deprenyl are a part of the prescribing pharmacopia of veterinarians specifically to increase mammal lifespan a large plurality of research chemicals have been described at the scientific literature that increase the lifespan of a number of species some argue that molecular nanotechnology will greatly extend human life spans if the rate of increase of life span can be raised with these technologies to a level of twelve months increase per year this is defined as effective biological immortality and is the goal of radical life extension non-human biological longevity main article list of long-living organisms currently living methuselah
