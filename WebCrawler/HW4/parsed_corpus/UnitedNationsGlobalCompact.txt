broader un goals such as the millennium development goals mdgs and sustainable development goals sdgs moving forward the un global compact and its signatories are deeply invested and enthusiastic about supporting work towards the sdgs the un global compact was announced by then un secretary-general kofi annan in an address to the world economic forum on january 31 1999 and was officially launched at un headquarters in new york on july 26 2000.the global compact office works off of a mandate set out by the un general assembly as an organization that promotes responsible business practices and un values among the global business community and the un system the un global compact is a founding member of the united nations sustainable stock exchanges sse initiative along with the principles for responsible investment pri the united nations environment programme finance initiative unep-fi and the united nations conference on trade and development unctad the ten principles the un global compact was initially launched with nine principles on june 24 2004 during the first global compact leaders summit kofi annan announced the addition of the tenth principle against corruption in accordance with the united nations convention against corruption adopted in 2003 human rights businesses should principle 1 support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and principle 2 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses labour standards businesses should uphold principle 3 the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining principle 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour principle 5 the effective abolition of child labour and principle 6 the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation environment businesses should principle 7 support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote environmental responsibility and principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies anti-corruption principle 10 businesses should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery facilitation the un global compact is not a regulatory instrument but rather a forum for discussion and a network for communication including governments companies and labour organisations whose actions it seeks to influence and civil society organizations representing its stakeholders the un global compact says that once companies declared their support for the principles this does not mean that the global compact recognizes or certifies that these companies have fulfilled the compact’s principles instead as mentioned in a 2015 interview with executive director lise kingo we are the guide dogs not the watchdogs with the organization seeking to prioritize providing resources and support instead of attempting to enforce discipline the un global compacts goals are intentionally flexible and vague but it distinguishes the following channels through which it provides facilitation and encourages dialogue policy dialogues learning local networks and projects given recent climate talks and summits the un global compact stands to play a critical role in helping signatories and governments work in part to achieve the sdgs recent studies indicate that businesses are more open than ever to private sector interventions such as carbon pricing and other mechanics to help curb climate effects within the scope of business solutions the global compact also will periodically create resources and guides that business and non profit organizations may use in their efforts to support the compacts overall mission one such example is the sdg compass developed in collaboration with the global reporting initiative gri and world business council for sustainable development wbscd which is a collection of resources analysis of the goals indicators for businesses tools for stakeholders that companies can utilize in finding out their role in helping to achieve the sdgs history the first global compact leaders summit chaired by the then secretary-general kofi annan was held in un headquarters in new york on june 24 2004 to bring intensified international focus and increased momentum to the un global compact the second global compact leaders summit chaired by secretary-general ban ki-moon was held on 5–6 july 2007 at the palais des nations in geneva switzerland it adopted the geneva declaration on corporate responsibility marking

leadership identifying leadership criteria linked to implementation of the ten principles efforts to support development objectives and engagement in the global compact was released in 2009 rotary international partnered with the un global compact this was a very friendly partnership since rotary international played a role in the chartering of the united nations since its creation in 2000 the global compact has been primarily focused on helping support and achieve the millennium development goals however after those expired in 2015 their top priority has been updated to the pursuit and progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals and the sdgs accompanying 2030 deadlines un global compact – cities programme in 2001 the city of melbourne proposed that cities as well as corporations should be allowed to join the un global compact arguing that this would provide a clear statement of a citys commitment to positive change as well as motivating participation in international dialogue the proposal was accepted and the un global compact  cities programme was launched in 2002 it was formed as an urban-focused component of the global compact with its international secretariat initially located in melbourne australia the aim of the programme is to improve urban life in cities throughout the world melbourne became the first city to engage the global compact in june 2001 there are as of 2016 over 130 member cities in the programme in april 2003 under the directorship of david teller a framework called the melbourne model was developed that went beyond the ten principles it begins by drawing the resources of government business and civil society into a cross-sector partnership in order to develop a practical project that addresses a seemingly intractable urban issue in 2007 the then director paul james 2007–2014 and his colleagues dr andy scerri and dr liam magee took this methodology further by integrating the partnership model with a four-domain sustainability framework called circles of sustainability in 2007 the secretariat moved from the committee for melbourne to the global cities institute at rmit university itself affiliated with un-habitat there projects associated with city-based responses to global climate change and globalization became increasingly important the melbourne model was further elaborated with a sustainability indicators program developed as a way of assessing and monitoring progress in 2012 the circles of sustainability method was elaborated to guide a city or urban region through a rigorous assessment process as one of the outcomes it provides a figurative image of the overall sustainability of that city to illustrate its strengths and weaknesses in 2015 rmit professor ralph horne became the third director of the un global compact cities programme and in february 2016 an urban thinkers campus was organised at rmit melbourne in collaboration with world vision international as part of the buildup to un habitat iii the theme of the urban thinkers campus was ethical cities locking in liveability this was followed by the organisation of a urban innovation forum on ethical cities in july 2016 in barcelona spain as a collaboration between the un global compact  cities programme rmit europe and un-habitat local networks of the global compact local networks of the global compact

of their local networks local connections to supplement the international connections made by the global compact at large can help to broaden the engagement and impact of members local networks are
