this article is about the chemical element for other uses see phosphorus disambiguation phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol p and atomic number 15 as an element phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but because it is highly reactive phosphorus is never found as a free element on earth at 0.099 phosphorus is the most abundant pnictogen in the earths crust with few exceptions minerals containing phosphorus are in the maximally oxidised state as inorganic phosphate rocks the first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced white phosphorus in 1669 emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen – hence the name taken from greek mythology Φωσφόρος meaning light-bearer latin lucifer referring to the morning star the planet venus or mercury the term phosphorescence meaning glow after illumination originally derives from this property of phosphorus although this word has since been used for a different physical process that produces a glow the glow of phosphorus itself originates from oxidation of the white but not red phosphorus — a process now termed chemiluminescence together with nitrogen arsenic and antimony phosphorus is classified as a pnictogen phosphorus is essential for life phosphates compounds containing the phosphate ion po4 are a component of dna rna atp and the phospholipids which form all cell membranes demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine and bone ash was an important early phosphate source phosphate mines contain fossils especially marine fossils because phosphate is formed from the deposits of animal remains and excreta low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems the vast majority of phosphorus compounds produced are consumed as fertilisers phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents pesticides and nerve agents characteristics main article allotropes of phosphorus physical phosphorus exists as several forms allotropes that exhibit strikingly different properties the two most common allotropes are white phosphorus and red phosphorus white phosphorus and related molecular forms from the perspective of applications and chemical literature the most important form of elemental phosphorus is white phosphorus often abbreviated as wp it is a soft and waxy solid which consists of tetrahedral p 4 molecules in which each atom is bound to the other three atoms by a single bond this p 4 tetrahedron is also present in liquid and gaseous phosphorus up to the temperature of 800 °c 1,470 °f when it starts decomposing to p 2 molecules white phosphorus exists in two crystalline forms alpha α and beta β at room temperature the alpha-form is stable which is more common and it has cubic crystal structure and at 195.2 k −78.0 °c it transforms into beta-form which has hexagonal crystal structure these forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent p4 tetrahedra white phosphorus is the least stable the most reactive the most volatile the least dense and the most toxic of the allotropes white phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus this transformation is accelerated by light and heat and samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow for this reason white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure e.g weapons-grade not lab-grade wp is also called yellow phosphorus when exposed to oxygen white phosphorus glows in the dark with a very faint tinge of green and blue it is highly flammable and pyrophoric self-igniting upon contact with air owing to its pyrophoricity white phosphorus is used as an additive in napalm the odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell and samples are commonly coated with white phosphorus pentoxide which consists of p 4o 10 tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices white phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide thermolysis cracking of p4 at 1100 kelvin gives diphosphorus p2 this species is not stable as a solid or liquid the dimeric unit contains a triple bond and is analogous to n2 it can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents at still higher temperatures p2 dissociates into atomic p red phosphorus red phosphorus is polymeric in structure it can be viewed as a derivative of p4 wherein one p-p bond is broken and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron resulting in a chain-like structure red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to 250 °c 482 °f or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight phosphorus after this treatment is amorphous upon further heating this material crystallises in this sense red phosphorus is not an allotrope but rather an intermediate phase between the white and violet phosphorus and most of its properties have a range of values for example freshly prepared bright red phosphorus is highly reactive and ignites at about 300 °c 572 °f though it is more stable than white phosphorus which ignites at about 30 °c 86 °f after prolonged heating or storage the color darkens see infobox images the resulting product is more stable and does not spontaneously ignite in air violet phosphorus violet phosphorus is a form of phosphorus that can be produced by day-long annealing of red phosphorus above 550 °c in 1865 hittorf discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallised from molten lead a redpurple form is obtained therefore this form is sometimes known as hittorfs phosphorus or violet or α-metallic phosphorus black phosphorus black phosphorus is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below 550 °c 1,022 °f it is also known as β-metallic phosphorus and has a structure somewhat resembling that of graphite black phosphorus is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures about 12,000 standard atmospheres or 1.2 gigapascals or in the presence of mercury in appearance properties and structure it resembles graphite being black and flaky a conductor of electricity and has puckered sheets of linked atoms high pressures are usually required to produce black phosphorus but it can also be produced at ambient conditions using metal salts as catalysts other forms another form scarlet phosphorus is obtained by allowing a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide to evaporate in sunlight another allotrope is diphosphorus it contains a phosphorus dimer as a structural unit and is highly reactive isotopes main article isotopes of phosphorus twenty-three isotopes of phosphorus are known including all possibilities from 24p up to 46p only 31p is stable and is therefore present at 100 abundance the half-integer nuclear spin and high abundance of p make phosphorus-31 nmr spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus-containing samples two radioactive isotopes of phosphorus have half lives suitable for biological scientific experiments these are 32p a beta-emitter 1.71 mev with a half-life of 14.3 days which is used routinely in life-science laboratories primarily to produce radiolabeled dna and rna probes e.g for use in northern blots or southern blots 33p a beta-emitter 0.25 mev with a half-life of 25.4 days it is used in life-science laboratories in applications in which lower energy beta emissions are advantageous such as dna sequencing the high energy beta particles from 32p penetrate skin and corneas and any 32p ingested inhaled or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids for these reasons occupational safety and health administration in the united states and similar institutions in other developed countries require personnel working with 32p to wear lab coats disposable gloves and safety glasses or goggles to protect the eyes and avoid working directly over open containers monitoring personal clothing and surface contamination is also required shielding requires special consideration the high energy of the beta particles gives rise to secondary emission of x-rays via bremsstrahlung braking radiation in dense shielding materials such as lead therefore the radiation must be shielded with low density materials such as acrylic or other plastic water or when transparency is not required even wood occurrence see also categoryphosphate minerals minerals phosphate rock at 0.099 phosphorus is the most abundant pnictogen in the earths crust but it is not found free in nature but it is widely distributed in many minerals mainly phosphates inorganic phosphate rock which is partially made of apatite an impure tri-calcium phosphate mineral is today the chief commercial source of this element according to the us geological survey usgs about 50 percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in the arab nations large deposits of apatite are located in china russia morocco florida idaho tennessee utah and elsewhere albright and wilson in the uk and their niagara falls plant for instance were using phosphate rock in the 1890s and 1900s from tennessee florida and the Îles du connétable guano island sources of phosphate by 1950 they were using phosphate rock mainly from tennessee and north africa in the early 1990s albright and wilsons purified wet phosphoric acid business was being adversely affected by phosphate rock sales by china and the entry of their long-standing moroccan phosphate suppliers into the purified wet phosphoric acid business in 2012 the usgs estimated 71 billion tons of world reserves where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices 0.19 billion tons were mined in 2011 critical to contemporary agriculture its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population recent reports suggest that production of phosphorus may have peaked leading to the possibility of global shortages by 2040 in 2007 at the rate of consumption the supply of phosphorus was estimated to run out in 345 years however some scientists now believe that a peak phosphorus will occur in 30 years and that at current rates reserves will be depleted in the next 50 to 100 years cofounder of boston-based investment firm and environmental foundation jeremy grantham wrote in nature in november 2012 that consumption of the element must be drastically reduced in the next 20-40 years or we will begin to starve according to n.n greenwood and a earnshaw authors of the textbook chemistry of the elements however phosphorus comprises about 0.1 by mass of the average rock and consequently the earths supply is vast although dilute urine main article reuse of excreta urine contains most 94 according to wolgast of the npk nutrients excreted by the human body the more general limitations to using urine as fertiliser depend mainly on the potential for buildup of excess nitrogen due to the high ratio of that macronutrient and inorganic salts such as sodium chloride which are also part of the wastes excreted by the renal system the degree to which these factors impact the effectiveness depends on the term of use salinity tolerance of the plant soil composition addition of other fertilising compounds and quantity of rainfall or other irrigation urine typically contributes 70 of the nitrogen and more than half the phosphorus and potassium found in urban waste water flows while making up less than 1 of the overall volume thus far source separation or urine diversion and on-site treatment has been implemented in south africa china and sweden among other countries with the bill and melinda gates foundation provided some of the funding implementations urine management is a relatively new way to view closing the cycle of agricultural nutrient flows and reducing sewage treatment costs and ecological consequences such as eutrophication resulting from the influx of nutrient rich effluent into aquatic or marine ecosystems proponents of urine as a natural source of agricultural fertiliser claim the risks to be negligible or acceptable other organic sources historically-important but limited commercial sources were organic such as bone ash and in the latter 19th century guano supernovae remnants in 2013 astronomers detected phosphorus in cassiopeia a which confirmed that this element is produced in supernovae as a byproduct of supernova nucleosynthesis the phosphorus-to-iron ratio in material from the supernova remnant could be up to 100 times higher than in the milky way in general production main article phosphoric acid most production of phosphorus-bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers for this purpose phosphate minerals are converted to phosphoric acid it follows two distinct chemical routes the main one being treatment of phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid the other process utilises white phosphorus which may be produced by reaction and distillation from very low grade phosphate sources the white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with base to give phosphate salts phosphoric acid produced from white phosphorus is relatively pure and is the main route for the production of phosphates for all purposes including detergent production elemental phosphorus presently about 1,000,000 short tons 910,000 t of elemental phosphorus is produced annually calcium phosphate phosphate rock mostly mined in florida and north africa can be heated to 1,200–1,500 °c with sand which is mostly sio 2 and coke refined coal to produce vaporised p 4 the product is subsequently condensed into a white powder under water to prevent oxidation by air even under water white phosphorus is slowly converted to the more stable red phosphorus allotrope the chemical equation for this process when starting with fluoroapatite a common phosphate mineral is side products from this process include ferrophosphorus a crude form of fe2p resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors the silicate slag is a useful construction material the fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in water fluoridation more problematic is a mud containing significant amounts of white phosphorus production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive the white phosphorus is transported in molten form some major accidents have occurred during transportation train derailments at brownston nebraska and miamisburg ohio led to large fires the worst incident in recent times was an environmental contamination in 1968 when the sea was polluted from spillage andor inadequately treated sewage from a white phosphorus plant at placentia bay newfoundland another process by which elemental phosphorus is extracted includes applying at high temperatures 1500 °c historically before the development of mineral-based extractions white phosphorus was isolated on an industrial scale from bone ash in this process the tricalcium phosphate in bone ash is converted to monocalcium phosphate with sulfuric acid monocalcium phosphate is then dehydrated to the corresponding metaphosphate when ignited to a white heat with charcoal calcium metaphosphate yields two-thirds of its weight of white phosphorus while one-third of the phosphorus remains in the residue as calcium orthophosphate compounds see also categoryphosphorus compounds oxoacids of phosphorus phosphorous oxoacids are extensive often commercially important and sometimes structurally complicated they all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus  phosphorus bonds although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed only nine are important and three of them hypophosphorous acid phosphorous acid and phosphoric acid are particularly important phosphorusv compounds oxides the most prevalent compounds of phosphorus are derivatives of phosphate po4 a tetrahedral anion phosphate is the conjugate base of phosphoric acid which is produced on a massive scale for use in fertilisers being triprotic phosphoric acid converts stepwise to three conjugate bases phosphate exhibits the tendency to form chains and rings with p-o-p bonds many polyphosphates are known including atp polyphosphates arise by dehydration of hydrogen phosphates such as hpo4 and h2po4 for example the industrially important trisodium triphosphate also known as sodium tripolyphosphate stpp is produced industrially on by the megatonne by this condensation reaction phosphorus pentoxide p4o10 is the acid anhydride of phosphoric acid but several intermediates between the two are known this waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water with metal cations phosphate forms a variety of salts these solids are polymeric featuring p-o-m linkages when the metal cation has a charge of 2 or 3 the salts are generally insoluble hence they exist as common minerals many phosphate salts are derived from hydrogen phosphate hpo4 pcl5 and pf5 are common compounds pf5 is a colourless gas and the molecules have trigonal bypramidal geometry pcl5 is a colourless solid which has an ionic formulation of pcl4 pcl6 but adopts the trigonal bypramidal geometry when molten or in the vapour phase pbr5 is an unstable solid formulated as pbr4brand pi5 is not known the pentachloride and pentafluoride are lewis acids with fluoride pf5 forms pf6 an anion that is isoelectronic with sf6 the most important oxyhalide is phosphorus oxychloride pocl3 which is approximately tetrahedral before extensive computer calculations were feasible it was thought that bonding in phosphorusv compounds involved d orbitals computer modeling of molecular orbital theory indicates that this bonding involves only s and p-orbitals nitrides the pn molecule is considered unstable but is a product of crystalline phosphorus nitride decomposition at 1100 k similarly h2pn is considered unstable and phosphorus nitride halogens like f2pn cl2pn br2pn and i2pn oligomerise into cyclic polyphosphazenes for example compounds of the formula pncl2n exist mainly as rings such as the trimer hexachlorophosphazene the phosphazenes arise by treatment of phosphorus pentachloride with ammonium chloride pcl5 nh4cl → 1n npcl2n 4 hcl when the chloride groups are replaced by alkoxide ro a family of polymers is produced with potentially useful properties sulfides main article phosphorus sulfide phosphorus forms a wide range of sulfides where the phosphorus can be in pv piii or other oxidation states the most famous is the three-fold symmetric p4s3 which is used in strike-anywhere matches p4s10 and p4o10 have analogous structures phosphorusiii compounds all four symmetrical trihalides are well known gaseous pf3 the yellowish liquids pcl3 and pbr3 and the solid pi3 these materials are moisture sensitive hydrolysing to give phosphorous acid the trichloride a common reagent is produced by chlorination of white phosphorus the trifluoride is produced from the trichloride by halide exchange pf3 is toxic because it binds to haemoglobin phosphorusiii oxide p4o6 also called tetraphosphorus hexoxide is the anhydride of poh3 the minor tautomer of phosphorous acid the structure of p4o6 is like that of p4o10 without the terminal oxide groups mixed oxyhalides and oxyhydrides of phosphorusiii are almost unknown organophosphorus compounds main article organophosphorus compounds compounds with p-c and p-o-c bonds are often classified as organophosphorus compounds they are widely used commercially the pcl3 serves as a source of p in routes to organophosphorusiii compounds for example it is the precursor to triphenylphosphine treatment of phosphorus trihalides with alcohols and phenols gives phosphites e.g triphenylphosphite similar reactions occur for phosphorus oxychloride affording triphenylphosphate phosphorusi and phosphorusii compounds these compounds generally feature p-p bonds examples include catenated derivatives of phosphine and organophosphines compounds containing pp double bonds have also been observed although they are rare phosphines phosphine ph3 and its organic derivatives pr3 are structural analogues with ammonia nh3 but the bond angles at phosphorus are closer to 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives it is an ill-smelling toxic compound phosphorus has an oxidation number of 3 in phosphine phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide ca3p2 unlike ammonia phosphine is oxidised by air phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula pnhn2 the highly flammable gas diphosphine p2h4 is an analogue of hydrazine phosphides phosphides arise by reaction of metals with red phosphorus the alkali metals group 1 and alkaline earth metals can form ionic compounds containing the phosphide ion p these compounds react with water to form phosphine other phosphides for example na3p7 are known for these reactive metals with the transition metals as well as the monophosphides there are metal rich phosphides which are generally hard refractory compounds with a metallic lustre and phosphorus rich phosphides which are less stable and include semiconductors schreibersite is a naturally occurring metal rich phosphide found in meteorites the structures of the metal rich and phosphorus rich phosphides can be structurally complex spelling and etymology the name phosphorus in ancient greece was the name for the planet venus and is derived from the greek words φῶς light φέρω carry which roughly translates as light-bringer or light carrier in greek mythology and tradition augerinus Αυγερινός morning star still in use today hesperus or hesperinus ΄Εσπερος or Εσπερινός or Αποσπερίτης evening star still in use today and eosphorus Εωσφόρος dawnbearer not in use for the planet after christianity are close homologues and also associated with phosphorus-the-planet according to the oxford english dictionary the correct spelling of the element is phosphorus the word phosphorous is the adjectival form of the p valence so just as sulfur forms sulfurous and sulfuric compounds phosphorus forms phosphorous compounds e.g phosphorous acid and p valence phosphoric compounds e.g phosphoric acids and phosphates history and discovery phosphorus was the 13th element to be discovered for this reason and also due to its use in explosives poisons and nerve agents it is sometimes referred to as the devils element it was the first element to be discovered that was not known since ancient times the discovery of phosphorus is credited to the german alchemist hennig brand in 1669 although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time brand experimented with urine which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism working in hamburg brand attempted to create the fabled philosophers stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly it was named phosphorus mirabilis miraculous bearer of light his process originally involved letting urine stand for days until it gave off a terrible smell then he boiled it down to a paste heated this paste to a high temperature and led the vapours through water where he hoped they would condense to gold instead he obtained a white waxy substance that glowed in the dark brand had discovered phosphorus we now know that brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate nh 4nahpo 4 while the quantities were essentially correct it took about 1,100 litres 290 us gal of urine to make about 60 g of phosphorus it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus brand at first tried to keep the method secret but later sold the recipe for 200 thalers to d krafft from dresden who could now make it as well and toured much of europe with it including england where he met with robert boyle the secret that it was made from urine leaked out and first johann kunckel 1630–1703 in sweden 1678 and later boyle in london 1680 also managed to make phosphorus possibly with the aid of his assistant ambrose godfrey-hanckwitz who later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus boyle states that krafft gave him no information as to the preparation of phosphorus other than that it was derived from somewhat that belonged to the body of man this gave boyle a valuable clue so that he too managed to make phosphorus and published the method of its manufacture later he improved brands process by using sand in the reaction still using urine as base material robert boyle was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur-tipped wooden splints forerunners of our modern matches in 1680 in 1769 johan gottlieb gahn and carl wilhelm scheele showed that calcium phosphate ca 3po 4 2 is found in bones and they obtained elemental phosphorus from bone ash antoine lavoisier recognised phosphorus as an element in 1777 bone ash was the major source of phosphorus until the 1840s the method started by roasting bones then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product alternately precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids white phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort carbon monoxide and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack in the 1840s world phosphate production turned to the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat guano see also guano islands act these became an important source of phosphates for fertiliser in the latter half of the 19th century phosphate rock a mineral containing calcium phosphate was first used in 1850 to make phosphorus and following the introduction of the electric arc furnace in 1890 elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone-ash heating to electric arc production from phosphate rock after the depletion of world guano sources about the same time mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production phosphate rock production greatly increased after world war ii and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today see the article on peak phosphorus for more information on the history and present state of phosphate mining phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertiliser industry where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various superphosphate fertiliser products white phosphorus was first made commercially in the 19th century for the match industry this used bone ash for a phosphate source as described above the bone-ash process became obsolete when the submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production was introduced to reduce phosphate rock the electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war in world war i it was used in incendiaries smoke screens and tracer bullets a special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen-filled zeppelins over britain hydrogen being highly flammable during world war ii molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in britain to specially selected civilians within the british resistance operation for defence and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects early matches used white phosphorus in their composition which was dangerous due to its toxicity murders suicides and accidental poisonings resulted from its use an apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food which was detected by the stews giving off luminous steam in addition exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe necrosis of the bones of the jaw the infamous phossy jaw when a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered with its far lower flammability and toxicity laws were enacted under the berne convention 1906 requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture the toxicity of white phosphorus led to discontinuation of its use in matches the allies used phosphorus incendiary bombs in world war ii to destroy hamburg the place where the miraculous bearer of light was first discovered glow it was known from early times that the green glow emanating from white phosphorus would persist for a time in a stoppered jar but then cease robert boyle in the 1680s ascribed it to debilitation of the air in fact it is oxygen being consumed by the 18th century it was known that in pure oxygen phosphorus does not glow at all there is only a range of partial pressure at which it does heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures in 1974 the glow was explained by r j van zee and a u khan a reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid or liquid phosphorus forming the short-lived molecules hpo and p 2o 2 that both emit visible light the reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence hence the extended time the glow continues in a stoppered jar since that time phosphors and phosphorescence were used loosely to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning although the term phosphorescence is derived from phosphorus the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called chemiluminescence glowing due to a cold chemical reaction not phosphorescence re-emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it applications fertiliser main article fertiliser phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient often the limiting nutrient and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture fertilisers containing as much as 70 to 75 p2o5 its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population that led to large increase in phosphate po4 production in the second half of the 20th century artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate cah2po42 and calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4·2h2o produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate processing phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid for obtaining fertiliser is so important to the global economy that this is the primary industrial market for sulfuric acid and the greatest industrial use of elemental sulfur organophosphorus compounds white phosphorus is widely used to make organophosphorus compounds through intermediate phosphorus chlorides and two phosphorus sulfides phosphorus pentasulfide and phosphorus sesquisulfide organophosphorus compounds have many applications including in plasticisers flame retardants pesticides extraction agents nerve agents and water treatment metallurgical aspects phosphorus is also an important component in steel production in the making of phosphor bronze and in many other related products phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus-containing copper cuofp alloys with a higher hydrogen embrittlement resistance than normal copper matches main article match the first striking match with a phosphorus head was invented by charles sauria in 1830.19 these matches and subsequent modifications were made with heads of white phosphorus an oxygen-releasing compound potassium chlorate lead dioxide or sometimes nitrate and a binder they were poisonous to the workers in manufacture sensitive to storage conditions toxic if ingested and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface production in several countries was banned between 1872 and 1925 the international berne convention ratified in 1906 prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches in consequence the strike-anywhere matches were gradually replaced by safety matches wherein the white phosphorus was replaced by phosphorus sesquisulfide p4s3 sulfur or antimony sulfide such matches are difficult to ignite on any surface other than a special strip the strip contains red phosphorus that heats up upon striking reacts with the oxygen-releasing compound in the head and ignites the flammable material of the head water softening sodium tripolyphosphate made from phosphoric acid is used in laundry detergents in some countries but banned for this use in others this compound softens the water to enhance the performance of the detergents and to prevent pipeboiler tube corrosion niche applications phosphates are used to make special glass for sodium lamps bone-ash calcium phosphate is used in the production of fine china phosphoric acid made from elemental phosphorus is used in food applications such as soft drinks and as a starting point for food grade phosphates these include mono-calcium phosphate for baking powder and sodium tripolyphosphate phosphates are used to improve the characteristics of processed meat and cheese and in toothpaste white phosphorus called wp slang term willie peter is used in military applications as incendiary bombs for smoke-screening as smoke pots and smoke bombs and in tracer ammunition it is also a part of an obsolete m34 white phosphorus us hand grenade this multipurpose grenade was mostly used for signaling smoke screens and inflammation it could also cause severe burns and had a psychological impact on the enemy military uses of white phosphorus are constrained by international law in trace amounts phosphorus is used as a dopant for n-type semiconductors p and p are used as radioactive tracers in biochemical laboratories phosphate is a strong complexing agent for the hexavalent uranyl uo2 species for this reason apatite and other natural phosphates can be very rich in uranium tributylphosphate is an organophosphate soluble in kerosene used to extract uranium in the purex process for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel biological role inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate po3− 4 is required for all known forms of life phosphorus plays a major role in the structural framework of dna and rna living cells use phosphate to transport cellular energy with adenosine triphosphate atp necessary for every cellular process that uses energy atp is also important for phosphorylation a key regulatory event in cells phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes calcium phosphate salts assist in stiffening bones every living cell is encased in a membrane that separates it from its surroundings cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins typically in the form of a bilayer phospholipids are derived from glycerol with two of the glycerol hydroxyl oh protons replaced by fatty acids as an ester and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol an average adult human contains about 0.7 kg of phosphorus about 85–90 in bones and teeth in the form of apatite and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids ~1 the phosphorus content increases from about 0.5 weight in infancy to 0.65–1.1 weight in adults average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about 0.4 gl about 70 of that is organic and 30 inorganic phosphates a well-fed adult in the industrialized world consumes and excretes about 1–3 grams of phosphorus per day with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus-containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as h 2po− 4 and hpo2− 4 only about 0.1 of body phosphate circulates in the blood paralleling the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells bone and teeth enamel the main component of bone is hydroxyapatite as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate possibly including carbonate hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel water fluoridation enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material called fluoroapatite phosphorus deficiency in medicine phosphate deficiency syndrome may be caused by malnutrition by failure to absorb phosphate and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood such as re-feeding after malnutrition or pass too much of it into the urine all are characterised by hypophosphatemia which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of atp too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification hardening of organs and soft tissue and can interfere with the bodys ability to use iron calcium magnesium and zinc phosphorus is an essential macromineral for plants which is studied extensively in edaphology to understand plant uptake from soil systems phosphorus is a limiting factor in many ecosystems that is the scarcity of phosphorus limits the rate of organism growth an excess of phosphorus can also be problematic especially in aquatic systems where eutrophication sometimes leads to algal blooms food sources the main food sources for phosphorus are the same as those containing protein although proteins do not contain phosphorus for example milk meat and soya typically also have phosphorus as a rule if a diet has sufficient protein and calcium the amount of phosphorus is probably sufficient precautions organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials many are required for life but some are extremely toxic fluorophosphate esters are among the most potent neurotoxins known a wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as pesticides herbicides insecticides fungicides etc and weaponised as nerve agents against enemy humans most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients the white phosphorus allotrope presents a significant hazard because it ignites in air and produces phosphoric acid residue chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called phossy jaw white phosphorus is toxic causing severe liver damage on ingestion and may cause a condition known as smoking stool syndrome in the past external exposure to elemental phosphorus was treated by washing the affected area with 2 copper sulfate solution to form harmless compounds that are then washed away according to the recent us navys treatment of chemical agent casualties and conventional military chemical injuries fm8-285 part 2 conventional military chemical injuries cupric copperii sulfate has been used by u.s personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations however copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis the manual suggests instead a bicarbonate solution to neutralise phosphoric acid which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them or by their phosphorescence in the dark in dark surroundings fragments are seen as luminescent spots promptly debride the burn if the patients condition will permit removal of bits of wp white phosphorus that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning do not apply oily-based ointments until it is certain that all wp has been removed following complete removal of the particles treat the lesions as thermal burns as white phosphorus readily mixes with oils any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed people can be exposed to phosphorus in the workplace by inhalation ingestion skin contact and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the phosphorus exposure limit permissible exposure limit in the workplace at 0.1 mgm over an 8-hour workday the national
