polymath works diamonds first popular book the third chimpanzee the evolution and future of the human animal 1991 examines human evolution and its relevance to the modern world incorporating evidence from anthropology evolutionary biology genetics ecology and linguistics the book traces how humans evolved to be so different from other animals despite sharing over 98 of our dna with our closest animal relatives the chimpanzees the book also examines the animal origins of language art agriculture smoking and drug use and other apparently uniquely human attributes it was well received by critics and won the 1992 rhône-poulenc prize for science books and the los angeles times book prize his second and best known popular science book guns germs and steel the fates of human societies was published in 1997 it asks why eurasian peoples conquered or displaced native americans australians and africans instead of vice versa it argues that this outcome was not due to biological advantages of eurasian peoples themselves but instead to features of the eurasian continent in particular its high diversity of wild plant and animal species suitable for domestication and its eastwest major axis that favored the spread of those domesticates people and technologies for long distances with little change in latitude the first part of the book focuses on reasons why only a few species of wild plants and animals proved suitable for domestication the second part discusses how local food production based on those domesticates led to the development of dense and stratified human populations writing centralized political organization and epidemic infectious diseases the third part compares the development of food production and of human societies among different continents and world regions guns germs and steel became an international best-seller was translated into 33 languages and received several awards including a pulitzer prize an aventis prize for science books and the 1997 phi beta kappa award in science a television documentary series based on the book was produced by the national geographic society in 2005 in his third book why is sex fun also published in

long-term pair relationship marriage coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory provision of parental care by fathers as well as by mothers having sex in private rather than in public concealed ovulation female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle including days of infertility female but not male menopause and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics diamonds next book collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed published in 2005 examines a range of past societies in an attempt to identify why they either collapsed or continued to thrive and considers what contemporary societies can learn from these historical examples as in guns germs and steel he argues against explanations for the failure of past societies based primarily on cultural factors instead focusing on ecology among the societies mentioned in the book are the norse and inuit of greenland the maya the anasazi the indigenous people of rapa nui easter island japan haiti the dominican republic and modern montana the book concludes by asking why some societies make disastrous decisions how big businesses affect the environment what our principal environmental problems are today and what individuals can do about those problems like guns germs and steel collapse was translated into dozens of languages became an international best-seller and was the basis of a television documentary produced by the national geographic society it was also nominated for the royal society prize for science books in 2008 diamond published an article in the new yorker entitled vengeance is ours describing the role of revenge in tribal warfare in papua new guinea a year later two indigenous people mentioned in the article filed a lawsuit against diamond and the new yorker claiming the article defamed them in 2013 the observer reported that the lawsuit was withdrawn by mutual consent after the sudden death of their lawyer in 2010 diamond co-edited with james robinson natural experiments of history a collection of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the study of history that he advocates the book’s title stems from the fact that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences i.e by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria instead one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed either by different starting conditions or by different impacts the book’s afterword classifies natural experiments discusses the practical difficulties of studying them and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties diamonds most recent book the world until yesterday published in 2012 asks what the western world can learn from traditional societies it surveys 39 traditional small-scale societies of farmers and hunter-gatherers with respect to how they deal with universal human problems the problems discussed include dividing space resolving disputes bringing up children treatment of elders dealing with dangers formulating religions learning multiple languages and remaining healthy the book suggests that some practices of traditional societies could be usefully adopted in the modern industrial world today either by individuals or else by society as a whole views at the end of his book collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed jared diamond wrote people who get depressed at such thoughts big global environmental problems often then ask me jared are you optimistic or pessimistic about the world’s future i answer i am a cautious optimist by that i mean that on the one hand i acknowledge the seriousness of the problems facing us if we don’t make a determined effort to solve them and if we don’t succeed at that effort the world as a whole within the next few decades will face a declining standard of living or perhaps something worse that’s the reason why i decided to devote most of my career efforts at this stage of my life to convincing people that our problems have to be taken seriously and won’t go away otherwise on the other hand we shall be able to solve our problems – if we choose to do so personal life diamond is married to marie cohen granddaughter of polish
