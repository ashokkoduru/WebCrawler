profits mainstream microeconomic theory posits that the ultimate goal of a business is to make money stated differently the reason for a business’s existence is to turn a profit the profit motive is a key tenet of rational choice theory or the theory that economic agents tend to pursue what is in their own best interests accordingly businesses seek to benefit themselves andor their shareholders by maximizing profits as it extends beyond economics into ideology the profit motive has been a great matter of contention economics the profit motive ensures that resources are being allocated efficiently for instance austrian economist henry hazlitt explains “if there is no profit in making an article it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself in other words profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing theoretically in free and competitive markets maximizing profits ensures that resources are not wasted free and competitive markets rarely exist in reality so market intervention is required to ensure maintenance of the profit efficiency of an economy the profit motive is a good of value to the economy it is needed to provide incentive to generate efficiency and innovation however over-remuneration of the profit motive creates profit inefficiency criticisms the majority of criticisms against the profit motive center on the idea that profits should not supersede the needs of people michael moore’s film sicko for example attacks the healthcare industry for its alleged emphasis on profits at the expense of patients moore explains another common criticism of the profit motive is that it is believed to encourage selfishness and greed critics of the profit motive contend that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits counter-criticisms free-market economists argue that the profit motive coupled with competition actually reduces the final price of an item for consumption rather than raising it they argue that businesses profit by selling a good at a lower price and at a greater volume than the competition economist thomas sowell uses supermarkets as an example to illustrate this point “it has been estimated that a supermarket makes a clear profit of about a penny on a dollar of sales if that sounds pretty skimpy remember that it is collecting that penny on every dollar at several cash registers simultaneously and in many cases around the clock.” economist milton friedman has argued that greed and self-interest are universal human traits on a 1979 episode of the phil donahue show friedman states “the world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests.” he continues by explaining that only in capitalist countries where individuals can pursue their own self-interest people have been able to escape from “grinding poverty.” author and philosopher ayn rand defended selfishness on ethical grounds her nonfiction work the virtue of selfishness argues that selfishness is a moral good and not an excuse to act with disregard for others economic development without the profit motive many economic and political theories advocate for an economy without the profit system and thus the profit motive such as anarchist communism socialism calculation in kind lange model examples of economic models without the profit motive include gift economy some political theories advocate extensive government regulation over the ability for businesses to pursue profit without abolishing the profit system namely corporatism national socialism nazism implemented in nazi germany fascism implemented in fascist italy interventionist
