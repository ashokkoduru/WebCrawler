aldo leopold january 11 1887 – april 21 1948 was an american author philosopher scientist ecologist forester conservationist and environmentalist he was a professor at the university of wisconsin and is best known for his book a sand county almanac 1949 which has sold more than two million copies leopold was influential in the development of modern environmental ethics and in the movement for wilderness conservation his ethics of nature and wildlife preservation had a profound impact on the environmental movement with his ecocentric or holistic ethics regarding land he emphasized biodiversity and ecology and was a founder of the science of wildlife management early life rand aldo leopold was born in burlington iowa on january 11 1887 his father carl leopold was a businessman who made walnut desks and his mother born clara starker was carls first cousin charles starker father of clara and uncle of carl was a german immigrant educated in engineering and architecture rand aldo was named after two of carls business partners—c w rand and aldo sommers—although the rand was eventually dropped the leopold family included younger siblings mary luize carl starker and frederic leopolds first language was german although he mastered english at an early age aldo leopolds early life was highlighted by the outdoors carl would take his children on excursions into the woods and taught his oldest son woodcraft and hunting aldo showed an aptitude for observation spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home mary would later say of her older brother he was very much an outdoorsman even in his extreme youth he was always out climbing around the bluffs or going down to the river or going across the river into the woods he attended prospect hill elementary where he ranked at the top of his class and then the overcrowded burlington high school every august the family vacationed in michigan at the forested les cheneaux islands in lake huron which the children took to exploring schooling in 1900 gifford pinchot who oversaw the newly implemented division of forestry in the department of agriculture donated money to yale university to begin one of the nations first forestry schools hearing of this development the teenage leopold decided on forestry as a vocation his parents agreed to let him attend the lawrenceville school a preparatory college in new jersey in order to improve his chances of admission to yale the burlington high school principal wrote in a reference letter to the headmaster at lawrenceville that leopold was as earnest a boy as we have in school painstaking in his work moral character above reproach he arrived at his new school in january 1904 shortly before he turned seventeen he was considered an attentive student although he was again drawn to the outdoors lawrenceville was suitably rural and leopold spent much time mapping the area and studying its wildlife leopold studied at the lawrenceville school for a year during which time he was accepted to yale university because the yale school of forestry granted only graduate degrees he first enrolled in sheffield scientific schools preparatory forestry courses for his undergraduate studies while leopold was able to explore the woods and fields of lawrenceville daily sometimes to the detriment of his studying in yale he had little opportunity to do so his studies and social life engagements made his outdoor trips few and far between career in 1909 leopold was assigned to the forest services district 3 in the arizona and new mexico territories at first he was a forest assistant at the apache national forest in the arizona territory in 1911 he was transferred to the carson national forest in northern new mexico leopolds career which kept him in new mexico until 1924 included developing the first comprehensive management plan for the grand canyon writing the forest services first game and fish handbook and proposing gila wilderness area the first national wilderness area in the forest service system on april 5 1923 he was elected an associate member now called professional member of the boone and crockett club a wildlife conservation organization founded by theodore roosevelt and george bird grinnell in 1924 he accepted transfer to the u.s forest products laboratory in madison wisconsin and became an associate director in 1933 he was appointed professor of game management in the agricultural economics department at the university of wisconsin–madison the first such professorship of wildlife management leopold lived in a modest two-story home close to the university of wisconsin–madison campus with his wife and children his children followed in his footsteps as teachers and naturalists aldo starker 1913–1983 was a wildlife biologist and professor at uc berkeley luna b leopold 1915–2006 became a hydrologist and geology professor at uc berkeley nina leopold bradley 1917–2011 was a researcher and naturalist aldo carl

conservationist today leopolds home is an official landmark of the city of madison he purchased eighty acres in the sand country of central wisconsin the once-forested region had been logged swept by repeated fires overgrazed by dairy cows and left barren there he put his theories to work in the field and eventually wrote his best-selling a sand county almanac 1949 finished just prior to his death leopold died of a heart attack while battling a wild fire on a neighbors property ideas early on leopold was assigned to hunt and kill bears wolves and mountain lions in new mexico local ranchers hated these predators because of livestock losses but leopold came to respect the animals he developed an ecological ethic that replaced the earlier wilderness ethic that stressed the need for human dominance rethinking the importance of predators in the balance of nature resulted in the return of bears and mountain lions to new mexico wilderness areas by the early 1920s leopold had concluded that a particular kind of preservation should be embraced in the national forests of the american west he was prompted to this by the rampant building of roads to accommodate the proliferation of the automobile and the related increasingly heavy recreational demands placed on public lands he was the first to employ the term wilderness to describe such preservation over the next two decades he added ethical and scientific rationales to his defense of the wilderness concept in one essay he rhetorically asked of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map leopold saw a progress of ethical sensitivity from interpersonal relationships to relationships to society as a whole to relationships with the land leading to a steady diminution of actions based on expediency conquest and self-interest leopold thus rejected the utilitarianism of conservationists such as gifford pinchot and theodore roosevelt by the 1930s leopold was the nations foremost expert on wildlife management he advocated the scientific management of wildlife habitats by both public and private landholders rather than a reliance on game refuges hunting laws and other methods intended to protect specific species of desired game in his 1933 book game management leopold defined the science of wildlife management as the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use but as curt meine has pointed out he also viewed it as a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment the concept of wilderness also took on a new meaning he no longer saw it as a hunting or recreational ground but as an arena for a healthy biotic community including wolves and mountain lions in 1935 he helped found the wilderness society dedicated to expanding and protecting the nations wilderness areas he regarded the society as one of the focal points of a new attitude—an intelligent humility toward mans place in nature science writer connie barlow says leopold wrote eloquently from a perspective that today would be called religious naturalism nature writing leopolds nature writing is notable for its simple directness his portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved or had known for many years displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature he offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems such as land out of a sense of a culture or societys sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong he felt the security and prosperity resulting from mechanization now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there however he also wrote theoretically the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmers chains but whether it really does is debatable a sand county almanac the book was published in 1949 shortly after leopolds death one of the well-known quotes from the book which clarifies his land ethic is a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise p.262 the concept of a trophic cascade is put forth in the chapter thinking like a mountain wherein leopold realizes that killing a predator wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem — a conclusion that found sympathetic appreciation generations later in january 1995 i helped carry the first grey wolf into yellowstone where they had been eradicated by federal predator control policy only six decades earlier looking through the crates into her eyes i reflected on how aldo leopold once took part in that policy then eloquently challenged it by illuminating for us how wolves play a critical role in the whole of creation he expressed the ethic and the laws which would reintroduce them nearly a half-century after his death — bruce babbitt former secretary of the interior land ethic in the land ethic a chapter in a sand county almanac leopold delves into conservation in the ecological conscience section he wrote conservation is a state of harmony between men and land he noted that conservation guidelines at the time boiled down to obey the law vote right join some organizations and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land the government will do the rest p. 243–244 leopold explained legacy the aldo leopold foundation of baraboo wisconsin was founded in 1982 by aldo and estella leopolds five children as a 501c3
