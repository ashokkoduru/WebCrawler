of life expectancy education and per capita income indicators which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development a country scores higher hdi when the lifespan is higher the education level is higher the gdp per capita is higher the fertility rate is lower and the inflation rate is lower the hdi was developed by the pakistani economist mahbub ul haq working alongside indian economist amartya sen often framed in terms of whether people are able to be and do desirable things in their life and was published by the united nations development programme the 2010 human development report introduced an inequality-adjusted human development index ihdi while the simple hdi remains useful it stated that the ihdi is the actual level of human development accounting for inequality and the hdi can be viewed as an index of potential human development or the maximum ihdi that could be achieved if there were no inequality origins the origins of the hdi are found in the annual human development reports produced by the human development reports office of the united nations development programme undp these were devised and launched by pakistani economist mahbub ul haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies to produce the human development reports mahbub ul haq formed a group of development economists including paul streeten frances stewart gustav ranis keith griffin sudhir anand and meghnad desai working alongside nobel laureate amartya sen they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public academics and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being sen initially opposed this idea but he was helped by haq in order to develop the index sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index but haq requested him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being dimensions and calculation new method 2010 report onwards published on 4 november 2010 and updated on 10 june 2011 the 2010 human development report hdi combines three dimensions a long and healthy life life expectancy at birth education index mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling a decent standard of

enrollment ratio with one-third weighting standard of living as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity this methodology was used by the undp until their 2011 report the formula defining the hdi is promulgated by the united nations development programme undp in general to transform a raw variable say x displaystyle x  into a unit-free index

alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called western models of development failure to include any ecological considerations lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking lack of attention to development from a global perspective measurement error of the underlying statistics and on the undps changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of low medium high or very high human development countries see also environmental full-cost accounting overconsumption and ecological debt day economists hendrik wolff howard chong and maximilian auffhammer discuss the hdi from the perspective of data error in the underlying health education and income statistics used to construct the hdi they identified three sources of data error which are due to i data updating ii formula revisions and iii thresholds to classify a countrys development status and conclude that 11 21 and 34 of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error respectively the authors suggest that the united nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because  they claim  the cut-off values seem arbitrary can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics and have the potential to misguide politicians investors charity donors and the public who use the hdi at large in 2010 the undp reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low medium and high human development countries in a comment to the economist in early january 2011 the human development report office responded to a january 6 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the wolff et al paper the human development report office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the hdi and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by wolff et al in that it generates a system for continuous updating of the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place geographical coverage the hdi has extended its geographical coverage david hastings of the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific published a report geographically extending the hdi to 230 economies whereas the undp hdi for 2009 enumerates 182 economies and coverage for the 2010 hdi dropped to 169 countries countryregion
