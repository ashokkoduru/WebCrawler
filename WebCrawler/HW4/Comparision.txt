Explanation:

Cosine similarity = Vq*Vd/|Vq|*|Vd|
where Vq is the query vector and Vd is the document vector.

TF-IDF is not a unique method, but a class of techniques where similarity between documents and queries are measured via the sum of term frequencies multiplied by terms importance. The term importance is frequently expressed via the IDF (the inverse document frequency frequency tfâ€“idf, actually it is the logarithm of IDF that is used in practice) .

Lucene combines Boolean model and Vector space Model

The results will be different, because of the consideration of the weight of the terms. Here tfidf is taken as the weight of the term. I normalized the document term frequency, which is not a good idea in case of lengthy documents. Since the information about the repetition of word across the length of the document is lost.

Also lucent uses some kind of concept called document boost, which is independent on query and calculated before hand while indexing the documents. Query-boost for the query (actually for each query term) is known when search starts.

In our algorithm Generally a high weight in tf-idf is obtained by a high term frequency in a particular document and low document frequency in the whole corpus since it is an inverse relationship. 

The ratio inside the logarithm will be always greater than 1. Because no of documents a term appears will be less than or equal to total number of documents. As a term appears in more documents the ratio will be closer to one. which means the log of that value will move closer to zero. So the lower the weightage more frequent is the term

If the value is much closer to zero the retrieval model does not give proper documents since most of the documents(which makes the value inside the log closer to 1) contains that term and the querying will not be efficient.
